I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this 
out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

Thanks,
Kate

about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet.

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he 
was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I 
remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two 
coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either 
of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this 
hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.

I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from 
Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem 
eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment 
on? Was it Avista that time too?

The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just 
let me know when you have a moment to talk.

I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact 
is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the 
middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port 
of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is 
linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in 
Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check 
on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct 
counterparty name?

Thanks,
Kate

I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Sean just looked these confirms over, and skimmed our contract with Aquila, 
and he said the language is fine as it is. I guess Unrestricted Mid-C is just 
a reiteration of Mid-C. If this causes a problem with your confirm process, 
though, I would have Bloomberg change it. It doesn't seem like we should have 
to go to the trouble of adding another, redundant delivery point name in our 
system just because that's what they call it. I know that sounds mean - but 
I'm so slammed today I can't help it!

Thanks for your help,
Kate

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and 
the location is for unrestricted Mid-C.  Should we have this deal in enpower 
as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just

Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that 
the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they 
might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.

If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the 
system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to 
get them in the system shortly.

Thanks,
Kate

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

Subject: Re: contacts  

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name "Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc." in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along 
through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on 
4/10.)

I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name 
we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I 
spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off 
of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, 
I changed the deal from it's "new counterparty" status.

Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're 
the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and 
there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana 
Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana 
Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no 
confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default 
to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). 
Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,

I've added the third leg to deal 566375 and changed comments in each leg to 
reflect that. We had a bit of confusion about who was actually adding the new 
pub code, but it's in the system now and the deal is ready to be confirmed. 
Just a note - I previously had all the Sunday and Holiday hours in the 
off-peak leg of this deal (so Risk could calc the value correctly), and now 
I've deleted those strips to account for leg 3 which contains only Sunday and 
Holiday hours. Please let me know if anything looks different, other than 
that, on your end.

Thanks,
Kate

You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery 
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have 
any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look 
identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail 
of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty 
names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet 
normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the 
prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.

Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.

I've seen a few problems with EES lately.  Last month, Kate Symes took care

Virginia, please take a look at DMS #'s  7365 & 7367.  These are the start of 
the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Tom does not have record of this deal at all. And I checked with the

These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for 
future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only 
should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize 
any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports. 

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884



Thanks!!

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Thanks,
Kate

All these have been changed to CAISO firm energy, and deal 576511 has been 
changed to Reliant Energy Services. Thanks for catching these. I'm forwarding 
this e-mail on to the Real Time group (again) as a reminder.

Thanks,

Hello!

These deal have NP/SP delivery points with firm energy.
576522
576512
576523
576517
576513
and 576511, but this one is also the wrong CP name.  Reliant HLP doesn't 
trade in the west.  I think it should be Reliant Energy Services.

Thanks!

517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's 
sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's 
phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like 
to take care of it myself if I can.

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

When you guys do loss return deals like this one with PGE, could you include 
a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and "no confirm" 
status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in 
these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.

Thanks,
Kate

Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

488908 is with Tradition Financial Services, not Natsource. I've changed this 
in the system.

488938 was just entered by Mike Swerzbin.

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

I'm not sure what's going on with these options, but I entered them as 2 PM 
expiry, then got a message that they were 2 AM from Stephanie Piwetz this 
morning, changed them AGAIN, and now they're back to 2 AM. I've changed them 
again, but I honestly have no idea why they keep going back. Please let me 
know if you see the expiry as 2 PM now.

That sounds great. Just let me know when you guys are ready to run the test 
upload. I can validate the deals and help work out any glitches, although it 
sounds like everything will go smoothly.

Thanks for all your hard work on this - having the swaps automated will make

Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise 
tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you 
notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.

One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, 
is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies 
noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the 
error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the 
error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily 
calculation.

Thanks again,

I think you're right, but the trader just took off for lunch. I'll check with 
him and kill the duplicate deal if necessary, then let you know when it's 
done.

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows

I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the 
holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do 
our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything 
resembling these deals comes up on your end.

I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be 
IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My 
skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is 
INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.

Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later 
today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail

the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

I just got this from Cute Blazer Guy - thought you might like to distribute 
it to the Origination team in case people want to partake in some more Blazer

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
lot.

Kate

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

Thanks,

Kimberly Indelicato

I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the 
deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of 
Oakland. Also, the contact is still Wing Lau @ 510-627-1457. I'll change it 
when Risk is done with the calc.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we 
will need a counterparty contact.

Thanks!

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

I'm dragging myself out of this office. I can hardly keep my eyes open, but 
it's well-deserved. Santana concert last night with friends from Ashland. The 
social schedule just never lets up. I don't know how feasible it would be for 
me to spend two months resisting the temptations of hand-holding boys and 
shadowy bars. But I will think seriously about the idea. Have a safe trip 
back home. Oh, and my Christmas plans still stand - gone from Dec. 22 to Jan. 
2. Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement.

I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris 
Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon 
still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon.

I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he 
was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if 
it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at 
SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact 
EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's 
anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, 
but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what 
you need from us.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Changed an EOL trade

Kate, 
#562373 was an EOL trade that Chris Mallory did. When it was done on line the 
delivery point was NP-15 now in Enpower it has been changed to SP-15. Could 
you check with Chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed 
to change EOL trades. If he did then I will have to get with Legal to find 
out what our next step would be.

Thanks,

Kimberly

I've changed both deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Tom said the guy who 
calls him from this counterparty each day says he's from Florida Power & 
Light - so he's going to ask him next time which counterparty he'd like us to 
specify in the deal. Also, I changed 570450 to a price of $80.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, This is a Tom Alonso trade. For these two trades they are entered as 
Florida Power & Light. FPL Energy Power Marketing sent a confirmation over on 
this trade. Could you ask Tom if he entered the trade incorrectly for both 
deal numbers. Secondly on #570450 the confirmation shows a price of $80. We 
have $85.00 in the system. Which one is correct?

Thanks,

Okay - I can forward the contract along on Monday when Chris Foster gets 
back. Also, I think I'd like Chris and his contact at Sierra to talk over the 
issue of whether we'll amend the contract to include "Inc." or whether we'll 
amend the counterparty name in EnPower. I've left a message for Chris 
regarding this question, and hopefully we'll touch base sometime today. I 
will let you know as soon as I hear back. (And feel free to nab him for a 
moment if you see him in the office!)

Thanks,

When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice 
mail.  I do have questions about the name that the contract has been written 
under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific 
Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in 
Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will 
not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under 
the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if 
the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we 
amend the contract to add "Inc." to the end of the name and set up this dba 
in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals.

In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812.  
Should this be a buy/resale?

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this "Rocky 
Mountain High" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this "normal" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna

It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I 
guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, 
not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?

I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually 
be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to 
NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.

In all the excitement of the day, I completely forgot to check on this deal. 
I know I got a call from one of you guys about the "New Counterparty" Diana 
Scholtes put in here; but I'm not sure now what I was supposed to check on.

Give me a call in the morning and let me know. Sorry!

"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not 
sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with 
something more original?

Mike negotiated no broker fee on this - he just spoke to his broker and asked 
to have them stop asking for that.

I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation 
letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to 
discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an 
EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not 
completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal 
expertise.

But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit 
down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject.

Thanks,
Kate

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air 
lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced 
her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three 
weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with 
marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds 
much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it 
unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last 
night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided 
to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street 
from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we 
felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place 
when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs 
(it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to 
say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, 
this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it 
goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more 
martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was 
coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him 
back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great 
legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in 
this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a 
sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on 
IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my 
friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar 
amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening 
that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum 
physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really 
quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a 
younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking 
about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very 
intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said 
something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was 
like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm 
just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or 
because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted 
to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i 
said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. 
oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll 
get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think 
much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly 
interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i 
kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an 
incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and 
josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to 
push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then 
all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our 
car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to 
give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't 
start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he 
worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over 
it had his name on it and the word "owner" underneath. do you think that 
means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab 
where they give all the employees stock options and call them "employee 
owners"? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of 
this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book 
club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of 
unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a 
running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who 
shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her 
alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be 
silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your 
evening such as the one i just sent you.

Okay so my date was SO amazing!  This guy is SO cute, SO nice, SO smart,

Kate - I WILL MARRY THIS MAN.  I kid you not.  He is the most normal guy I
have come across EVER.  He's trying to get a job in graphic design (so cute)
but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a
restaurant (so cute).  We've read all the same books.  He definitely has
money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can
see where I'm coming from.  He was just interested enough but kind of aloof
which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested.  Kate, this is so
weird.  Oh and he mentioned having a family twice, like as in working at a
restaurant isn't good for having a family.  HOW CUTE IS THAT?  I am in love.
Just thought I'd let you know . . .

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

The STCA desk will be short 75 MW on peak at NP-15 on 1/4. This is due to two 
sales involving the STNW desk and one involving LTWM which have been zeroed 
out in scheduling but not in EnPower. All three are for 25 MW on peak.

We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help?

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across 
something I hadn't noticed before. In EnPower, we have several choices for 
the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically "Mid-C Firm 
Peak." We have non-firm peak, and something called "Mid-Columbia Index." 

I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the 
Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index. In this case, because I was entering a 
round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different 
deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak, 
and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays. But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I 
entered the first as Mid-C Index.

Deal numbers are:
597244 - Peak
597245 - Off Peak
597246 - Sundays/Holidays

I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I 
want to make sure that "Mid-C Index" gets the peak price. Could you let me 
know if it doesn't? And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another 
pub code set up for peak price.

Thanks for your help on this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly 
chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are 
obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally 
went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this 
confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original 
deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that 
we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, 
we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just 
rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 
485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,

I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could 
include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and 
if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight 
to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a 
two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other 
data you'd like to see in graph form?

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.

Hello, can you check these deals and see if the counterparty name is wrong.  
They are in as Enmax Corporation and we are wondering if they should be Enmax 
Energy Corporation.  The contract did not come over correctly so we wanted to 
make sure the counterparty name is correct before we set up a new contract.

Thanks,

What better time to start thinking about the winter holidays than on 
Halloween?!

Just a reminder that our happy little office will be hosting a Holiday Party 
& Benefit Auction on Saturday, Dec. 2, beginning at 6 p.m. and lasting until 
the wee hours of the morning. We hope that everyone will be able to attend, 
which is why we're reminding you while the smell of pumpkin-insides and candy 
corn is still fresh in the air.

We will be holding a benefit raffle and auction again this year, and all 
proceeds will once again be matched by Enron Corp. Donations will be divided 
between Portland's Raphael House, a shelter for battered women and their 
children, and the Court-Appointed Special Advocates, a group that assists 
foster children and at-risk youth throughout the court process.

But who said charity couldn't be a hoot? There will be a pangea of prizes and 
a gaggle of goods for everyone (think Blazer tickets and autographed Blazer 
basketballs!). And a BAND! A swing band! It will prove to be the most 
fantastic Holiday Party this office has ever had....

We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the "Sort By" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - "Deal #" and "Desk." As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.

I wanted to check with you on this. All these deals are entered in your book, 
and I know the Services desk typically does their own confirmations with 
counterparties. However, these deals have comments in them that say they 
replace other deals. In that case, would you like them confirmed by Houston? 
Let me know.

We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to 
sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for 
everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it 
before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no 
problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have 
to get in the habit of doing it.

Thanks again,

 Hello Kate, thank your so much for everything.  Me and Jennifer both
like email better than fax.  Therefore, you can start emailing to us from
now on.  About counter-party, we prefer to be on the report but if it takes
too much of your time then it is up to you to include it or not.  We need
conter-party's name when we confirm any kind of mismatch problem.  If you
include on the report, it save you from us calling you.  Otherwise, we have
to call you and ask for counter-party's name when we need to confirm any
transactions.  It is your call.
 Again, thank you and feel free to call me if you have any further
questions/concerns.

P.S.  By the way, do you have any regular Firm On and Off Peak for Sunday?

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you
have any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should
look identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a
detail of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the
counterparty names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at
this sheet normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of
faxing the prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.

Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. 
Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into 
its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave 
told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, 
and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL 
deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you 
posted if anything else comes up.

Hi Kate, I know you are working on this problem.  This deal will not let me 
save it because it wants the schedule type filled in.  Let me know if there 
is a schedule type I can choose or if I should just wait until the problem is 
fixed.

So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
"alternative" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.

This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it

I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought

Kate,

Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?

I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office 
and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - 
I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!

season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships.

like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve

been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 



If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact 
Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Include the date

I've heard some mumbling about problems with EES deals, so this doesn't come 
as much of a surprise. Here's what I've done:

On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the 
trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a 
message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him 
tomorrow morning.

Deal #480433 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, 
it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday 
zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I 
can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our 
office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.)

I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change 
back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT 
for the time zone, to be on the safe side.

I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know 
as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else.

Kate

Subject: problems!

Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!

After researching the position further, I am very much interested in formally 
applying to work in Deal Control. I have spoken with Jeff Richter, Val Sabo, 
and Carla Hoffman about the requirements and responsibilities of the job, and 
I have a good understanding of the kind of candidate they're looking for. I 
feel I fit that profile and am excited by the challenge it presents.

I have also spoken with Mollie Gustafson and Chris Calger, who have given me 
their support in pursuing another opportunity within the company. (Although 
they would be understandably heartbroken.) 

Please let me know at your earliest convenience how to proceed in applying 
for this position. Thank you for your help, Amy.

Kate

Kate this trade is from yesterday.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?

Evelyn -
Here's the status of those year-long deals I changed last night. Everything 
should look good now - 571920 now has 25 mwh and 571801 is killed. Let me 
know if you still see something wrong.

Subject: Deal Change - Revision of last night's Deal Correction Report

This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade 
log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us 
today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with 
no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if 
you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.

Thanks for doing that. And those deals didn't show up in my query because I

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the

contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871.

Hello Kate,

In order for Power Traders to gain access to Power Desks, my team, 
GCP_Houston, must link their names to each Desk.
(Basically, we need a list of desks that the Traders need access.)

Please provide the following info:

Example(s): 

Add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)    EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "    EPMI Long Term West Management

Please submit your request(s) to GCP_Houston, (this is my entire team).

Best Rgds.

I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they 
need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember 
correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you 
get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or 
add the unit names.

Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for 
El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since 
they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to 
be changed (i.e. "yes-agreement" or "yes-counterparty to send confirm"), and 
I'll do that right away.

I've added a comment in each leg of 597246 - "Deal modified from three 
separate index-forwards to one deal with three legs." Does that work? And I'm 
checking with John Malowney now to see if the confirm you've already sent out 
will suffice - he's in a meeting right now. I'll get back to you in a moment.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Montana power  

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save 
because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a 
little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate 
automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't

Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones 
index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for 
you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the 
e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them.

And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system. 
Sounds pretty logical to me!

You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
& Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
correct counterparty name, though. 

Thanks for the heads up,
Kate

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.

Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the 
incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever!

The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as 
Enron Online deals. Oh joy!

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before 
and very cordially agreed to take a look at it. I just thought I'd keep you

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the "error." This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between "Dynegy Marketing & Trade" and "Dynegy 
Power Marketing." I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom 
for Monday and Tuesday. I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.

587941
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/23/01
$231.23
PGE3

589743
STCA sells 25 to STWBom
4/24/01
$266.00
NP-15

Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you 
about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday. 
Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it 
may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a 
broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
deals; they're highlighted in red:

459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)

457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)

468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
468440 - no change (buy side)

And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

Correct again....This deal has been changed. Also, I've forwarded these last 
two e-mails to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who can talk to these 
guys about using correct counterparty names in deal entry. In the future if 
you see errors or discrepancies in deals done by the Short Term West Hourly 
desk, please send the e-mail to Bill and myself. This will hopefully be a 
more direct way of nipping the problem in the bud.

changed to pinnacle west - and you might mention to apb, if you feel like it, 
that it would save their time during checkout if they told tom the correct 
counterparty when the trade was done - he said apb never seems to know 
whether it's APS or pinnacle, but for his part he doesn't mind which 
counterparty it's with - anyway, just fyi...

Hey there Mr. Real Time. Looks like you did a deal with Pacificorp on 11/28 - 
EPMI STCA buys 8 MW @ $60 for hour 2. These eight silly little megawatts have 
unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity. No, just 
kidding. But I think there should be a sale of 8 MW from Nevada to Mead on 
hour 2 somewhere in there. I don't know - I'm not the expert, which is why 
I'm asking you.

Will you please let Lisa Gang or me know how to fix this. I'm more than happy 
to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in 
the first place. (Kidding again.)

In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found 
two travel itineraries which came without prices on them. Jessica and Mollie 
have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did 
not detail the cost of the trip. 

The prices I need are from the following trips:

Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX, 
Reservation # AS/WXOKNK
 (reservation made August 24)
Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake 
City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3
 (reservation made September 6)

Thank you so much for your time.

Here's the latest -
The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real 
Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power 
back from us. The deals are in our system as follows:

594854
EPMI buys Sierra Pac.
NP-15
4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock
4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock
$218 off peak
$328 on peak

595714
Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling 
coordinator)
NP-15
4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock
$228
(Total Value = $103,968)

Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, 
not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, 
which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this 
helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time 
group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the 
whole day. 

I'll get back to you soon.

Kate

Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy 
backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me 
know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 
days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th.

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.

You didn't know that? It's actually Mary Katherine Symes. My parents decided 
that Katherine Mary didn't sound "Catholic" enough; but they still wanted a 
daughter named Katie, so they went right ahead and called me that from the 
day I was born. Needless to say, it's added an unnecessary element of 
confusion to my life in that people are always wondering who the hell this 
"Mary Symes" person is.

Thanks for noticing, though!

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

But seriously, call me tonight if you get a chance. If not, I'll try you (if

Well, I only went to the gym once last week, and then pretty much ate and 
slept all weekend, so I'm feeling like a pasty white blob of winter blubber. 
I'm just starting to get "homesick" for Maui, so Mexico will come not a 
minute too soon. Also, Molly and I went to see this movie last night, Requiem 
for a Dream. It was psychotic! It made me feel like moving to a farm and 
becoming a marathon-running vegan or something. Truly a horrible, horrible 
depiction of modern-day addictions and the messed-up way our society quells 
them.

So, needless to say, I am MAKING myself go to the gym today.

Anna's job opportunity sounds great, although I'm bummed we won't be roomies 
anytime soon. Maybe I'll get transferred to Enron's Colorado office.

It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
and move this version to production.

Subject: Deal Entry:  New Version


Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks,

I have one question about a receipt you have from Teala's Mexican Restaurant 
for dinner on Tuesday, Oct. 10. The total is $36. Did you have dinner by 
yourself, or with someone else? If so, who? Let me know when you get a chance 
so we can send this off and get you some money.

The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different 
counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data 
to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones 
daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. 

The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than 
that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an 
average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to 
ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the 
Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT 
participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:

Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases 
Reported NP-15 Sales
Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250
Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260
Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270

Now that's simple!

Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 
and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be 
excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

American Electric Power - Amerelecpo
Avista Energy - Avistaene
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra
El Paso Merchant Energy
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI
Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene
PacifiCorp - PACE
Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E
Powerex Corp. - PWX
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) 
- SCEM
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt

So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free 
to come bug me with questions. Good luck!

Kate

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,
Kate

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!
joan

My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called "Liar's Poker." I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking 
Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

P.S. What the heck is your address anyway?

It should be Arizona Public Service. I guess the CTPY name just changed, so 
Ryan was a bit confused. I talked with Bill Williams about it and forwarded

This was one of a slew of deals that one of our schedulers ran across that 
had the wrong time zone in the strips. According to Duong Luu, there was an 
EOL application error that was incorrectly populating deals that flow over 
4/1/01 - the first of day of Daylight Savings Time. Duong said the error has 
since been fixed. But for the incorrect deals, we had to go in and change all 
the strips back to PPT and re-save the deals so the time zones would populate 
correctly. Hope this doesn't cause too much confusion - but nothing should 
change other than that the MWH will be flowing on the correct hours now. Let 
me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

This is a Real Time deal, and that desk enters deals a bit differently than I 
do. When they initially do a deal, they enter it for a certain hour or set of 
hours. Then, if they agree with a counterparty to extend the deal to flow 
through more hours, they change the deal in Scheduling, not EnPower. The way 
to see the true volume of a Short Term West Hourly deal is to look in the 
"View Actuals" tab. If you look at this deal, you'll see that they extended 
the initial 5 MW at HE 11 to look like this:

HE 11 - 5 MW
HE 12 - 5 MW
HE 13 - 5 MW
HE 14 - 4 MW
HE 15 - 4 MW
HE 16 - 4 MW
HE 17 - 5 MW
+__________
 32 MW

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny

Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal.

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in 
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
"pissed") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate

Bill Williams just talked to Jake, the Sempra trader who did the trade, who 
recognized the deal and said he'd speak with Harry and clear it up. In the

474520 - Should not be $210. Actually, Bob just changed the deal to $307, so 
it was in wrong, but he said Prebon's price is totally off.

474593 - Again, we had the price wrong, but so did Prebon. Mallory just 
changed it to $210.

Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would 
be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will 
potentially do deals with all of the traders -

Long Term Southwest
Long Term Northwest
Long Term California
Long Term West Management

Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Hello Kate,

I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or 
Mid-Marketer
to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the 
GCP Team.

Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access.

Example Request(s): 

Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)     EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "     EPMI Long Term West Management

Thanks,

Samuel x3-9890

Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Thanks,

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,

Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris 
about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I 
can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West 
Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are:

580832
580137
580136

Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the 
re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance.

Kate

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the 
contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the 
contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871.

Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first 
three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because

let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers 
along for reference. They are as follows:

TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)
               QQ3837 (K-01)
                  QQ7050 (M-01)

Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that 
Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, 
who entered the deal with Valley Electric.

Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake.

Thanks,

This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward 
deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that 
when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold 
the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the 
trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me 
to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward 
deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark "no 
confirm" on these deals as well.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,

I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has 
CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a 
problem. And you're right - that's not bad at all!

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

1. 468359 is Mike Swerzbin's deal. He entered it incorrectly in his log. It's 
changed now.

2. 468404 and 468405 - Bob Badeer was given the wrong numbers by Amerex. He's 
changed the deals to reflect Amerex numbers.

3. 468302 is Donald Robinson's deal. I'm tracking him down right now to check 
on the term.

4. 468427 is $177, not $197. Jeff has really bad handwriting. I'll change 
this as soon as the calc is done (about 30 min.).

5. I've left Jeff a message - he's at an off-site meeting today and is 
probably giving a speech right now.l I don't see these deals in his trade 
log, so I really need to talk with him in order to find out whether or not he 
did them and where they might be.

I got a hold of Southern finally, and Mark Watts is out until Monday. The 
assistant who I spoke to knew pretty much nothing about this, so he said he 
couldn't verify whether or not they would be willing to ADP the deal. But 
according to our traders, they spoke with Mark Watts yesterday afternoon, and 
he agreed to ADP the December futures deal.

If this still seems to be a problem, please let me know. Otherwise I'll plan 
on talking to Watts on Monday.

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

There are several unit contingent deals that don't have the unit name in the 
comment section.  Can you have them put in this information.  I know you sent 
us a reference sheet, but I think it would be better if the trader would 
specify the unit in the comment section.

568863
568857

thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is 
in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits 
next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a 
deal is "pending credit approval" it's a little vague as to when the decision 
will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned 
about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's 
case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top 
of it and let you know this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
$45.00 off-peak hours.

They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
with Mike.

Thanks!!

Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Judy -
I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding 
a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally 
entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 11. Then the trader extended the 
deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they 
rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in 
Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total 
volume of the deal in our scheduling system.

At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct 
volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. 
Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's 
coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the 
discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to 
you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. 
Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're 
looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more 
about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently.

Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call 
with questions.

Thanks,
Kate

In regards to the e-mail you just sent - this is the most recent information 
I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?

Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy 
from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in 
EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the 
sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. 
I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and 
EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.

I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation 
with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, 
look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 
28th.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Re: Latest Information On April EES Items  

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate

RE: My newly formed case of dyslexia!

I switched the MW hours on these deals. 469098 should have 10 MW with Sempra. 
467455 should have 50 MW with SCEM. These are correct in the system now, but 
I just wanted to alert you to my error.

Thanks,

I've changed 469388 to include a broker fee - trader mistake. Mike Driscoll 
and Swerzbin swear that the other two should not include broker fees. 
Driscoll just checked with the Natsource broker, who cleared this up with his 
back office - so they should agree now. Let me know if there is still a 
discrepancy. I believe the Natsource broker is changing this.

I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
of the day, right?)

Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.

Thanks so much,
Kate

These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - 
Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. 
(This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to 
let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry 
about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!

Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with 
Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are 
in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as 
they've worked out a revised confirmation.

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

I think we ran into this problem before where the California schedulers, for 
whatever reason, didn't pull the .8 Riverside deal into their sheet, and 
therefore I didn't see it or add it to the EES sheet. Let me just check with 
Phil on this to make sure he didn't do it for a reason; then I can amend the 
sheet and re-send it. 

And on the Wed./Thurs. generation volumes - I can only assume that Phil spoke 
with Riverside at some point about the change to .55, but again I need to 
speak with him to verify this. He should be in the office soon, and I'll let 
you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan

We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in 
fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, 
and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our

I think she'd do that. Her parents are out of town right now, so she's

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

Yes - I finally reached someone at Avista who had been working on the problem 
as well. She filled me in on a few things, and I straightened out the story 
with our broker. It turned out to be Avista's fault - they failed to report 
to their broker that we paid them for a futures contract, and that triggered 
a domino effect of payment inquiries. We did pay, and the record shows that.

Thanks for following up!

Kate

I'm taking over Carla Hoffman's position at the Deal Control desk in 
Portland, and I've got a request from Kim Ward to look into this deal entered 
incorrectly by our Short Term Southwest desk. Unfortunately, I need more 
information, such as the deal number and term, in order to make any changes 
to it.

If you have this or know who does, please let me know and I'll be happy to 
make any necessary changes to this deal. My number in Portland is

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,

I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the 
deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker 
know to change the delivery point on the confirm.

This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it 
was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but 
I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought 
they were the same....???

Both 457489 and 459812 were logged in Mike's trade book with "no broker fee" 
written in the margin. I checked with Mike Driscoll, who helped Swerzbin 
enter the deals, who verified that these are sleeves of other deals and do 
not require broker fees.

Let me know if Natsource still disputes this.

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit 
the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for 
you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which 
NCPA shortname they're choosing.

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

I'm sorry my reply is so delayed - I was gone for the New Year holiday. This 
deal should have been entered on 12/19. It looks like it's still in there as 
12/20; but I wanted to check with you before changing it. Let me know.

beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout. 


Amerex West Checkout

503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I 
checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry 
separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened

deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows

Whew! I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere. 
The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which 
Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter 
blues and will no longer produce anything. Here is the error message it gives 
me:

Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt.

It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One 
interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I 
left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that 
same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, 
it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. 
It had the new section at the bottom titled "Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to 
enable"; whereas the version I had been using did not.

Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how 
to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it 
against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it 
would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because 
in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!

Thank you so much for your support on this so far. Hopefully we can work 
something out tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Chris entered this deal thinking that one was missing from a few days 
earlier. He then realized that the deal was already in, and zeroed this one 
out (instead of just killing it - sometimes those guys are in a big hurry!) 
So I'm going to go ahead and kill the deal, thus eliminating the need to 
change these other details. Does that make sense? Sorry for the confusion.

By the way, how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas? I spent 
mine on the beach with a Pina Colada in Mexico, and believe it or not, I'm 
actually glad to be back at work. I was beginning to feel worthless, not to 
mention sunburned. Although any minute now I'm going to be ready for my 
noontime siesta!

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim

I just spoke with Justin Rostant, who reported that ICE will begin sending 
him data tomorrow morning. So you can expect the ICE volumes to be included 
on tomorrow's EOL report. Let me know if you have any other specifications 
for the report.

Thanks,

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Thanks,
Kate

You're right - thanks for checking up on us. This deal was actually done this 
morning before Credit came out with the updated watchlist. He checked with 
Tracy Ngo, our credit person, on the deal and she's aware of and okay with 
it. I guess Bob snuck one in there!

Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba 
on our master agreement is "Sierra Pacific Industries" with no "Inc." at the 
end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, 
although the company is a corporation, they never use "Inc." in their 
contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master 
agreement because of those three pesky letters.

Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd 
like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - 
it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Please let me know whether these deals have the wrong energy type.  They all 
have np-15 or sp-15 delivery points.
Thank you!

This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one 
in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index 
prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak 
part.

Let me know if this makes any sense.

Thanks,
Kate

488908 is with Tradition Financial Services, not Natsource. I've changed this 
in the system.

488938 was just entered by Mike Swerzbin.
Buy Duke
57.00
Cal-07
25 MW
COB

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

According to Bob Badeer, these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder, on of 
our lawyers. I'll check with Christian to see why, and add comments to the 
deals to denote this. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you

The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about 
it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked 
with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day. 
But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away.

Subject: not to be confirmed

There is an hourly trader named Geir Solberg whose trades appear on our 
reports to be confirmed.  We go into each trade and change them to not to be 
confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.  I think 
perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.  Can you check with him on this. 
I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.

Thanks!

You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these 
things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 
347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you 
know I'm not ignoring you.

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious

Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
price is $285.95)
 Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.

Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.

Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.

Let me know if this resolves everything.

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any 
other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if 
you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard 
time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you 
feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and 
foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone. 

Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.

Talk to you soon,
Kate

Hey there stranger!

Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. 
It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had 
our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of 
sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't 
see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he 
not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail. 

I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at 
work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? 
Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown 
accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, 
or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.

Take care,
Kate

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency 
instead of daily:

483753
483759
483765
483766

Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options 
before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the 
deals. I'm sorry for the confusion. Thanks for catching that.

Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination 
of too many hours staring at a computer and too few hours sleeping - mixed in 
with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me 
good.

Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said 
he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any 
confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's 
have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough 
to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)

And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for checking up on this.

Kate

471977 was done with APB. I just changed it.

471975 was with Prebon. That's changed as well.

These deals were both sleeves in which Jeff entered the broker name on one 
side but not the other.

Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

Thanks,
Kate

How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one 
classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were 
three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre, 
like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it 
though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year 
behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit 
me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing 
themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going 
to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on. 

And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over 
the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my 
presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for 
her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of 
this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles 
herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they 
generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied 
with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything 
confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything 
pisses her off. Gotta love it. 

So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time 
popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point. 
I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a 
freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already 
am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and 
Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's 
thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads 
back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have 
my happy little family.....

Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose, 
which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?

Love ya,
Kate

Zero week is a one-week, four-credit course in June at U of O.  I'm trying
to get John to do it, too.  Maybe we should all take one together!  Anyway,
the website is uosummer.uoregon.edu (no www), but unfortunately none of the
info is posted yet because they're all a bunch of lazy pot-smoking
superfreaks over there in Eugene.  Usually you can choose from any general
ed courses - I'm taking polisci because I need it for my major.  They'll
have journalism and stuff like that.  We could crash at John's house and
party till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen!

I feel bad about Kitty, too.  Is she getting more nuts than ever?  I would
love to bring her out here if it wasn't for the obvious obstacles (she could
never go outside, she would rip my face off on the ride over, etc.).  If she
is still doing bad next year when my lease runs out, we could consider
bringing her out here.  I could move into a house.  Anyway, I'm sorry to
hear about the whole thing.  I feel really guilty too.  Hopefully Mom is
available for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact with
humans.

Well, have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi!  I got my
hair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa 1990.  I
look like a freak, and my hair is oily, and I don't want to go on this date.

Have a good night!
Anna

Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured
out I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before
going to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in,
being able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually
good-looking farm workers.Tres important!

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) -
I'll keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move
thing. I hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm
starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a
weird situation with Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to
just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my
house too; but the other part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed
that will ensue between her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm
thinking about it.

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally
extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I
hadn't insisted on getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that
other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you
could have otherwise spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the
days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about
it last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room
table, and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I
have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go
figure. Anyway, it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come
back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't
wait! Write back soon.

I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance
to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a
zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and
we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't "run into him".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited
because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention
broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing
until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground
zero
for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most
of
it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I
tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
"donation" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing "Don's Mixed Drinks" - not sure,
but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
"lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania"
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
"California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
know and I'll change those counterparty names too.

510867/860/857/853/775/774

509540/518/513/511/509/508/504/463/462

Thanks for your help on this.

Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 
514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak. 
Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know.

Thanks,

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark

Note to Real Time desk:
EES sent over revised volumes for delivery at SP-15 after I sent the 
spreadsheet out today. Please disregard the variance volumes for that 
delivery point. Instead, make a note of the new volumes, shown in red under 
the heading "EPMI Length" directly to the right of the "Var" column. Contact 
your fearless leader, Bill Williams III, with questions, comments, and

That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically 
typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed 
it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.

Thanks for catching that,

afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send 
out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request,

Subject: New Pub Posting Request

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

These two are the same deal. We just added TFS in there as the broker - Mike 
forgot that. But we recognize the trade as Cal-01, not Q3-01. Mike just 
talked to the broker, who's going to pull the tapes from Friday to determine 
who's correct, but for now he wants to leave it as Cal-01. I'll let you know 
if we hear otherwise.

Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and 
should be for Q1-01. 478199 was entered with the wrong price (165.05). It 
should be 164.95, and I'll change it when the Risk girls are done with their 
calc.

I just finally heard back from the traders on this deal. Apparently, Idaho's 
schedule was cut by the ISO on Sunday, and therefore, we had to cut our sale 
to them. The deal was originally 25 mw on peak, but was cut about 10 mw each 
hour. That's why each hour now shows 15 mw and some scraps. The remainder of 
the schedule we sold in the hour ahead market. This is a typical maneuver 
when the ISO cuts schedules, but I guess you guys haven't had to confirm 
daily deals in this situation before. Let me know if this is going to be a 
problem, and we'll figure something out.

Thanks,
Kate

God, that's so nice of you to thank me. So many of my students just spread 
their little wings and fly away, forgetting that I MADE them goddamit. 
Anyway, I'm glad you had fun in Maui. I honestly think it's pretty much 
impossible not to. I'm getting ready to go back, hopefully at the end of this 
winter when I'm nice and frostbitten, in time to see the whales, which by 
then will be like my family as I will have spent the previous six months 
porking out on turkey and stuffing and washing it down with quarts of eggnog. 

If you're planning any more trips in the future, my full list of city guides 
can be accessed at www.katerockstheworld.com. It's a start-up operation, but 
I plan on retiring in about.....wait, hold on.....I just retired.

See ya!
Kate

That's hilarious! My theme song for life is "Don't go breaking my heart" by 
Elton John and Kiki Dee, which incidentally has always been one of my 
favorites. I remember first hearing it on a Disney special where Elton did a 
duet with Minnie Mouse. What a kick! Thanks.

I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the

If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know.

This deal finally got sorted out this morning. I believe Kim Ward and Matt

But 465821 stands as Enron had it - we sell to Deseret. 

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to 
get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three 
places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming 
party in a couple weeks.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are "baby" and "poppa" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 
countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it 
sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I 
hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with 
a significant other.

Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.

Kate,

I'll lay off the "Date with Destiny" stuff...I was becoming bored with it as
well.  How was your weekend?  Did you and Amber go house hunting?  I had a
great time at the beach with the boys.  Chris asked me to tell you that he
wants you to come to Vietnam.

Take care,
Roberto

"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise
to only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm
not sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with
something more original?

I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part 
of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word 
"stunning" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an 
editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore 
journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a 
journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in 
his/her story. 

But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.

There was no date.

Kate

A heads up -

The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a 
50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15. This is due to an option that Sean 
and Diana decided not to exercise. Thought that might clear up at least one 
of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell 
all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

*Does this mean "live dance" or "dance lives" or "my friend Viva likes the 
way you dance" or none of the above?

This is a unit contingent deal.  We have been told that we have to have the 
unit name to include in the confirmation when we confirm these deals.  Can 
you have the traders add the unit name in the comment section whe they do 
unit contingent deals?

While you guys were all busy worrying over the California energy crisis, I 
slipped down to Mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even 
further to the south are faring. Do they still have lights? Is the AC shot? 
Can they even make a blended margarita?

Seriously, though, I will be out of the office on Friday, Dec. 22, and again 
from Wednesday, Dec. 27 to Monday, Jan. 2. I realize this is late notice; I 
did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a 
little further. I am truly sorry.

At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so 
appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and 
the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of 
from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can 
easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know 
it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call 
back later.

The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right 
now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of 
fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday 
afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain 
how to use it.

I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't 
exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is 
better for you than water. Sounds terrible. Please don't hesitate to call if 
you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course.

You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 
563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying 
to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal 
under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show 
up correctly for some reason.

Thanks,

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  It is a 24 hour deal 
against an index.  Shouldn't it be split out and priced against the 
individual on peak, off peak and Sunday index?

Rhonda did e-mail me about these deals last night. I forwarded it on to the 
Real Time manager and trader who entered the deals. It was actually a new 
real time guy using another trader's i.d. because he was waiting for his own 
- I don't think this is the kind of mistake the veterans should be making. At 
any rate, Bill changed the counterparty name and trader i.d. in all of these 
deals.

Thanks for the heads up on this.

This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.

AMEREX

Diana/Sean
I am missing the following deal:
1) Enron sells to Powerex MId-C light 3/29 at $140.00


Chris Mallory
Amerex does not recognize deal 563362




BLOOMBERG
All deals are o.k.





PREBON

Chris Mallory
deal 563461
Is this a duplicate of 563460 because Prebon only recognizes 1 deal

deal 563358
Prebon says should be heavy not light hrs.

Well, the origination tickets are up for grabs if you want them. I have been 
informed by Mollie, Oh Holy Keeper of the Tickets, that you must, and I 
quote, "come over here and beg me" if you want to procure free seats to 
tonight's game.

The ball is now in your court. I'd suggest driving down the middle, faking to 
the left, butt-kissing to the right, and taking it straight to the hole for a 
slam dunk. Good luck!

Just to keep you up to date on this -
I was told to call Larry Joe Hunter today for our counterparty matchups on 
the May futures contracts. I left him two messages, but never got a call 
back. I wonder if he's out of the office? Anyway, I'll definitely get a hold 
of someone tomorrow - if I can't I'll just go straight to the broker - and 
we'll get this deal out of the New CTPY status.

Thanks,
Kate

Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal 
numbers.

461029
Williams
115.00

461030
EES
114.95

461801
Mieco
115.00

461802
EES
114.95

And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso 
with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. 
Confusion! 

Hope this fixes it.

Following are the deals I changed to the correct time zones, per Will Smith's 
list:

520330 - forward
373613 - forward
359846 - EOL
353314 - EOL
352613 - EOL
349391 - EOL

349242 - EOL
330282 - EOL
300686 - forward
272524.2 - forward
220845 - forward

Most of these were just April deals, and it looks like they all suffered from 
the same incorrect default we ran into before. On the longer term deals I 
made sure to choose "no" when it asked if I would like to clear all routes 
for the deal; but let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her 
number is 703-853-3001.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own 
curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her 
group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until 
that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of 
petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check 
that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More 
information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Thanks,
Kate

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

Just wanted to keep you posted on this deal. You called me earlier and said 
that the counterparty, Deseret, had recorded this deal with Enron buying. We 
entered the deal with Enron selling. I have Matt Motley, Kim Ward, and Tim 
Belden reviewing the tapes of Kim Ward's conversation with Desret last week, 
in which it is clear that she was selling to Deseret. She's spoken with her 
contact there, who still disputes the deal and says we were buying. They're 
all talking it over right now, and I'll let you know as soon as we make a 
decisiion on whether or not to change this deal.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Subject: not to be confirmed

There is an hourly trader named Geir Solberg whose trades appear on our 
reports to be confirmed.  We go into each trade and change them to not to be 
confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.  I think 
perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.  Can you check with him on this. 
I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.

Thanks!

Yes, this is correct. Les Rawson, our services guy, did this deal which he 
explained is a little strange because the company we're buying generation 
from didn't want to provide firm energy, so we're selling the unit contingent 
instead of firm to Avista. Anyway, that's how he tried to explain it to me. I 
hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

P.S. Although the energy is correct in these deals, the days are not. I'll be 
changing 471884 and 471891 to reflect Mon. through Sat. on peak hours instead 
of M-S, Sundays and Holidays, on peak.

These two deals have the energy type as unit contingent.  Could you check and 
make sure this is correct?

Thanks!

I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since 
Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you 
think of it later, you might ask.

563906 - changed to Pinnacle West
563907 - changed to Pinnacle West
562226 - changed to APS

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!

Prebon, but forgot to change the strip in the deal. It's fixed now to reflect 
a term of 3/15 to 3/31.

This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade 
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was 
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He 
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe 
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.

In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be 
best? E-mail or call and let me know.

Thanks a lot!

I'm checking with Chris Foster and Chris Mallory, who are apparently the ones 
initiating these trades. Both are out of the office right now, so it might be 
tomorrow before I can get back to you on this. But my guess is that if APX 
does not want to receive confirms on daily deals, then we don't need to send 
them. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.

540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think 
they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit 
has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct 
entity.  Can you check?

The first two deals were already entered by Chris Mallory. Numbers are 478469 
and 478477. I'll add APB as the broker on both those deals.

The third deal was not entered and is actually a buy from Idaho, not Entergy.

I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Thanks,
Kate

Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

I'm so stoked you're going to Buena Vista Social Club. I can't believe you 
are such a rotten "bik" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?

My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, 
wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be 
living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say 
that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed 
sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can 
imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and 
went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think 
carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how 
much money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, 
and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm 
only speaking from Maui experience here. 

If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally 
broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to 
the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind 
of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd 
feel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would 
have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back 
- that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live 
with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've 
given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. 
Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.

Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're 
meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.

Love,
Kate

I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control 
position and what it entails. Coming from a background in print journalism 
leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for 
skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively. I'll come by 
sometime today to talk further about this opportunity. Thanks for the notice.

Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with 
deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time 
sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source 
of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting 
the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but 
I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with 
questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!

on record with the Confirms group in Houston?

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

thanks!

Diana just told me that these deals are NOT supposed to be confirmed. She's 
taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if 
you'd like to speak to Diana directly.

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

#533919
#533931
#533932
#533934

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
starts moving around.

Stay well!

Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. This is what I was 
referring to yesterday - that Real Time is now being charged $15 for trades - 
but cash and term traders should still be charged the traditional $.005. Why 
is Bloomberg recognizing these trades as Real Time?

Hi Kate, per our discussion on yesterday about the $15.00 flat fee on Tom's 
and Mark's deals, here is Bloomberg's response.  Please pass this info to all 
of our traders.  Please let me know what the response is from them.

Thanks

I sent a copy of the agreement to Melissa Murphy via fax. I'll need to get 
ahold of Chris Foster, who is in your Houston office at the moment, to locate 
the original. He won't be back in the Portland office until Monday morning. 
When would you like the original by? Just let me know - we'll get it to you 
as soon as we can.

Thanks,

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you.

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing 
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically 
forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by 
last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and 
Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared 
him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I 
accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but 
this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not 
even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's 
smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of 
here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

Subject: EWWW TOMATOES!

There are some Las Vegas Delight True Beef Steak tomatoes available by Jody's 
desk.

I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them, as I'm sure they don't taste very 
good. (Yeah, right!) 

Tomatoes are available in limited quantity, so come and get it!

*NOTE* If you get a tomato that is somewhat green, that means it's probably 
not good. You can put it on my desk and I'll take care of it. =o) 
OR, you can keep it on your counter for a day or two and it'll be ripe and 
ready to go! (I recommend doing the first thing...)

I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do. If so, would you check with 
him on these deals and find out if they should be with LADWPPX or Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power? I have a feeling it's the latter, but I'd like 
to know for sure before I change the deals and eliminate the useless 
counterparty name.

Thanks,
Kate

I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal 
should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, 
because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals 
alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me 
to make a note of this in the comments sections of the deals?

Subject: Re: APS/Pinnacle West  

Hello Kate,
APS and Pinnacle...We ran into a problem checking out for the end of the 
month, because a few deals had Pinnacle in the system, but Bloomberg on the 
bro confirm.  We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS 
showed the deals as APS on there side.  They are trying to segregate 
companies little by little.  We have been told by Rhonda, our contract 
administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are 
under WSPP.  

DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg 
trade; then cp should be APS.  DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under 
Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.       

Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and 
APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.  No, we will not have problems 
recognizing the old name, Rhonda says they will just be assigned over to 
Pinnacle, but we will not have to revise confirms.  Hope this helps!
Thanks
Stephanie

Regarding the last deal, Mike Driscoll talked to his broker at Bloomberg last 
night and asked him to change their confirm to say Pinnacle West. The broker 
said he'd check on it, but that Bloomberg hadn't switched their contract over 
yet and he didn't know if they could check a deal out under the new name. So 
we left it, under the impression that Bloomberg was actually in the wrong. My 
question is - has APS switched over to Pinnacle West entirely, and when or if 
Bloomberg starts recognizing Pinnacle as the counterparty are we going to 
have problems with deals containing the old counterparty name? I'm just 
trying to clarify, so I can let the traders know what to expect. Thanks for 
your help.

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Yes - I was also going to mention that I talked with Christian Yoder about 
this, and he confirmed that the counterparty name in the contract is The City 
of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Port of Oakland 
board, and on and on and on. So we'll be using that name, NOT the Port of 
Oakland, when doing deals with this counterparty. And out of curiosity, does 
anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland?

Thanks for following up,

I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact 
is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the 
middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port 
of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is 
linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in 
Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check 
on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct 
counterparty name?

I've added the unit names to the deals and reminded Les that they need to be

he sent out re: unit names spelled out the answers, but I took another look 
at it and it doesn't seem to really answer anything. I've attached it just in

guys in ANY way. If it doesn't, I can probably get him to draw up something 
more useful.

To re-cap:

I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties 
have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, 
HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated 
Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee, 
and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for 
reference:

595705
595714
595819

I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different 
counterparties' invoices. Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no, 
just kidding. Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise 
from these changes.

Thank you,
Kate

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate

I just got a hold of Mike, who is aware of these deals but isn't positive on 
the prices. He's going to have to check with the broker on Monday to get it

Subject: Derivatives I Training Course - June 4th and 5th

We will be offering Derivatives I training on-site.  If you are interested in 
attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

The EnPower IT group in Houston is making some changes to the EOL Report 
which in the long run will improve its functionality, but in the interim has 
left it temporarily disabled. I have left a message for Nicolay Kraltchev, 
the IT staff member in charge of the project, and he will be contacting both 
Carla Hoffman and me tomorrow. With any luck, this will be resolved by Friday 
evening and we can resume distribution of the report as usual. I'm sorry for 
any inconvenience this causes.

Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed 
to thoroughly confuse them. I'm researching most of these questions, but as 
with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the 
spreadsheet you guys send to them. Would you mind checking this out when you 
have a minute (or despite the fact that you don't)? If you revise anything, 
just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch.

540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think 
they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit 
has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct 
entity.  Can you check?

Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with 
Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of 
their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should

The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

I'm just going to leave this deal with "New Counterparty" for the time being. 
I had changed it to Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc., but it sounds like there 
may be a problem with this name. Please let me know what I can do to help 
this along, or give me a call when a decision is reached.

Sam, Please contact this CP (info on Kate's previous email) or find the dba 
information online with D&B or Lexis Nexis so that we can get the true 
lowdown on this name.  I don't think we should take the trader's information

Subject: New CTPY Name - Sierra Pacific Industries

Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba 
on our master agreement is "Sierra Pacific Industries" with no "Inc." at the 
end. I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that, 
although the company is a corporation, they never use "Inc." in their 
contracts. Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master 
agreement because of those three pesky letters.

Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you. In case you'd 
like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 - 
it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Thanks,

Enron is showing $85 for the offpeak load on 4/13 & 4/14..... APX is showing 
$80 for offpeak on 4/13 & 4/14....please verify and correct if necessary.  I 
have also attached APX invoice per the internet website below for both days.

Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

Thanks for checking though.

I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE 
that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently 
there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be 
confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," 
but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, 
or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.

Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and 
should be for Q1-01. 478199 was entered with the wrong price (165.05). It 
should be 164.95, and I'll change it when the Risk girls are done with their 
calc.

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks for the update.  The changes you have made to deals 566424.1 and 
566426.1 are not reflected on the carp report - maybe these need to be 
auto-scheduled??  As for 576512.1 I've added the hours in question to the

Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
message stating the following:

Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked 
(_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 

Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my 
merry way. Just thought you should know.

not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be

Looks like Amerex has this in as a peak deal. Bob shows off-peak, says Amerex 
is incorrect. Please let me know if they dispute.

Thanks,

It's Matt Motley's deal, but all the traders just got out of a meeting, so 
they're still entering deals. It should show up any minute.

Kate, I am checking out EES February deals with Brocklyn Couch and problems 
were noted on two deals 512775.1 on the 5th & 527967.1 on the 22nd.

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

Mark

Thanks. I just checked Peoplefinder and all the new information is in there. 
One thing I couldn't change, however, was my department and supervisor. This 
may have to be changed by HR or my new supervisor; but at any rate, I now 
work in West Power Trading and report to Jeff Richter and Tim Belden.

Thanks for your help.

Mom -
Thanks for the heads up. I am having the same nightmare with US Bank that 
I've had each time I've deposited any money: they won't let me have it! I've 
been meaning to e-mail Anna and let her know, but that's gone by the wayside 
along with pretty much everything else since I started this new job. I tried 
to close my account on Thursday in a last ditch effort to get at my money, 
and they politely told me I could close it on the same day I could get money 
out of the ATM, which will be on Wednesday. Until then my hands are tied. I'm 
really sorry about this - I know Anna needs help, and believe me, this isn't 
very convenient for me either. I'll e-mail her right now, and send her money 
on Wednesday.

Give me a call later if you'd like to meet at the gym. 

Kate

The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe 
you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I 
should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their 
own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two 
marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over 
the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a 
trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.

Thank you,

I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, 
but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now and I see a price of $65. If 
you could let me know what report is showing the incorrect price, I might be 
able to figure out why.

Thanks,

Matt Motley
deal 524143
Per Amerex the price should be $263 not $163 - price changed to $263

Mike Swerzbin
deal 524171
Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300

deal 524172
Per Amerex the price should be $300 not $310 - price changed to $300

deal 524267
Per Amerex the total mw should be 50 not 25 - MW should be 25 - other side of 
sleeve is 25 MW

deal 524310
Per Amerex the term should be March not April - term should be April

I am missing the following deal:
Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 - 
part of a spread sleeve done with EES and El Paso - only one broker fee 
agreed upon - fee included on deal 524247 NOT 524248

Jeff Richter
deal 523881
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - on peak deal - does 
not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)

deal 523882
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above

The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday 
mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a 
difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If 
it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who 
enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.

Thanks,
Kate

Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily

Obviously, we'll still enter the specific unit name in these deals, but this

Subject: RE:


What up dude!

I haven't heard from you in awhile, so I thought I would remind you that you
have a sister and she lives in Colorado and she has no friends and no life
and one psycho roommate and is therefore desperately in need of sane
conversation/gossip through which she can live vicariously.  How's it going?
Are you feeling better?  Is the roommate situation improving?  Mine is SO
not.  And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me into
the arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.  He launched a
surprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.  Yes,
it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.  We were just going to go out for A
drink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagers
in a prom limo.  Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket had
started to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-colored
wide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.  It was madness.
So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so now
I pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasons
for not spending the night at his house.    It's been almost a week so I
think he's starting to suspect something.  Little does he know that by the
time this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name
"Anna Symes".  He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel that
familiar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shoot
at it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.  Think I have issues?

Other than that, not a lot happening over here.  I like my new job, although
right now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed to
be doing a lot of the time.  I have been playing phone tag with Monica, but
I think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am in
desperate need of some friends.  Actually, starbucks guy and I had an
interesting conversation about this last night.  I have been feeling so down
lately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harder
than London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratch
in the social department.  Michelle is scary and therefore does not count as
a source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.  I'm trying to see
this as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy without
the network of people I have always had around me.  I know it's not the
Peace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.  Anyway, that's my
deep thought for the week.  I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet once
again about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).

By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?  He Claire Danes' boyfriend, so
you may have heard of him before.  Anyway, you have to check him out - he's
awesome!  The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes or
something in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).  It's a good
feel-good cd.  So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and when
are you coming to visit?  Okay, love you, miss you, etc.!

Besos,
Anna

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski
trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside,
let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're
totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied
by sun and not eternal grayness.

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber
out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to
Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either
way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,
friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and
hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll
give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

We just changed the deal - it was input correctly, but the computer did not 
change the time zones correctly. That's why we were off 25 MW. I'll let Duong

I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the 
bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer 
ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you 
bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 
12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other 
words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it?

As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least 
one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has 
nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it 
up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it.

Here's the latest I've heard from EES regarding ways in which we've managed 
to thoroughly confuse them. I'm researching most of these questions, but as 
with last month, there are a few Real Time deals they don't see in the

just let me know or e-mail it directly to Mark Confer and Brooklyn Couch.

Hello Cara,

We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and 
handling time zone issue very well.
Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we 
fixed it since then. All deals that you
provided to us had entered before July 2000.

We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have 
similar problem with time zone.

Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it 
immediately.

Your help is highly appreciated

Regards,
dluu

I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time 
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is 
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something 
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we see 
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of 
these deals are fixed.

Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time

Subject: Re: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio  

I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the "killed" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.

The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to 
Desk" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is 
though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! 
Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to 
watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply 
to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....

I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say 
anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me 
blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then 
rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang 
out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah 
blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the 
importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. 
But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of 
tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and 
Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I 
took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched 
the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening 
WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for 
that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the 
other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a 
message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's 
girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was 
very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with "us." I just 
assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse 
about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no 
way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. 
NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man 
himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date 
and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in 
this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride 
and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a 
lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be 
smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told 
him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and 
my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the 
other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that 
he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is 
where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to 
come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who 
we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't 
remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're 
home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things 
Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap 
stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, 
actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if 
you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red 
Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have 
to go. I'll call you tonight!

Take care, 
kate

That sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running
Man, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If
anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any of
your clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If
you think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which your
demeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he is
the stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the
same habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating
instances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And
being a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you
had the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.

Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.
I'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out
with you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we know
you'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out
here, though.  It's about 67 degrees right now and it's 9:00 in the morning
on a day in March.  I can't believe how happy this sun makes me!  You would
love it, too.

Okay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks
he's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.  A stiff margarita will make
this whole problem a lot more manageable, don't you think?  You should go
have one.  Love you!

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing

stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals
so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if
that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he
asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as

actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying
at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi
cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by
yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete

this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source 
of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I 
think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office 
workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or 
forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called 
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent 
company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes 
people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense 
punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.

Melissa -
I think we've finally reached a conclusion on the long term PX Index deals. 
I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with 
Constellation at the old index:

Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' 
positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset 
will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KS

This is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as 
Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think 
we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are 
necessary.

The deal numbers, for reference, are - 
453152/453175/453294/462109/471888/471889

Thanks for your patience on this,

Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then 
the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the 
index off set price.  If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to 
these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) 
then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.  I just want to make 
sure that Constellation agrees with however we handle this.

Thanks for your help,

Subject: Re: Constellation Cal Px trades  

I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this 
out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed 
confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County 
and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received 
them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?

Kate


(From 2/26/01)
Just something to keep in mind - 
The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
County for the following three deals -

432854
420554
420563

I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.

Thanks,
Kate

Here's the latest info. regarding Bloomberg's ability to accept deals with 
Pinnacle West (formerly Arizona Public Service Co.). From now on, we'll enter 
ALL deals with Pinnacle, despite Bloomberg's slow response to the 
counterparty name change. If you never knew that Bloomberg wasn't accepting 
confirms with the name Pinnacle on them, then disregard this message and 
continue as you were.

Thanks,

Rhonda Denton has just informed me that all deals according to Michele

Pinnacle West not Arizona Public Service.  No deals should be under Arizona 
Public just because Bloomberg is having problems or what ever re-doing the 
contract.   

>From this day forward please tell all our guys to please choose Pinnacle West 
not Arizona regardless of what Bloomberg says.  If they have any questions 
please have them contact Rhonda Denton at 853-5871 or Michele

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, 
I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on 
par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a 
salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing 
and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your 
calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come 
along.

Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
adding that right now.

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.  


           Kroum

The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to 
Desk" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

        Cara,

     This is all I have so far. I would appreciate your help to make it 
clearer.

     If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.

of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make 
big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of 
course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in 
case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?

Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868). The 
deals are as follows:

STCA buys SCL

515420
LTCA buys SCL
3/1/01-3/31/01
SP-15
Off Peak
$115.00

I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal, 
the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc. The volume is 
shaped between 1 and 2 MW. Please let me know if you have any questions.

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

Yep - the trade's there all right. I just talked to Mike again and he said 
he'd love to take the trade, but he's sure it's an error. To avoid any 
confusion later, and because he's already left the office for today, let's 
have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the 
traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them 
around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at 
California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be 
specified as CAISO firm. 

Thanks,
Kate

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Enron North America
121 SW Salmon, 3WTC 0306
Portland, OR 97204
(Tel.: 503-464-3830)

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente

Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term 
Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) 
 Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)
 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 
980362/983837/987050
 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post 
ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

Thank you,
Kate

Chris Foster checked and couldn't find anything regarding these deals. His 
take on it was that if Stewart needed them confirmed, he would have passed 
the message along to someone else or left record of the deals numbers 
somewhere. In the meantime, he said, there isn't much we can do as Stewart is 
in Italy and is virtually impossible to reach. 

If I find anything else out I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of

so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows

Okay - I've changed 578812 to Sierra Pacific Power Co. I asked Bill about 
this and he said he didn't realize the counterparty was in with Sierra 
Pacific Industries and not Sierra Pacific Power. The Real Time guys pay as 
little attention as possible to counterparty names, unfortunately.

Thanks for catching this,
Kate

When we do not have a transmission contract with an entity, we usually do a 
buy/resale to cover the transmission over their system.

When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice 
mail.  I do have questions about the name that the contract has been written 
under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific 
Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in 
Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will 
not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under 
the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if 
the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we 
amend the contract to add "Inc." to the end of the name and set up this dba 
in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals.

In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812.  
Should this be a buy/resale?

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Good morning -

Just wanted to let you know that I've been running the stage version of the 
Forward Obligation report using production data, and I seem to be getting all 
the same numbers as I do with the production version of the report. I will 
continue to compare the two today when I run these reports, just to make 
sure. But in the meantime, all looks well. Thanks for your help.

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.


     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

me on this extension until further notice (yours and mine!): 

(503) 464-3827

Or, if it's an emergency and you can't seem to make it out of the tangled web 
of receptionists and other phone-answerers, call my cell phone at (503)

I apologize for the confusion and for any inconvenience this may cause. 
Thanks for bearing with us!

Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and 
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out 
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a 
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their 
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.

Thanks,

Amy - This is a copy of the job description you sent out to the floor when I 
took the Deal Control position. I've modified it slightly to reflect some of 
my own observations of the position.

There is a position available in Deal Control, reporting to Jeff Richter and 
the Short Term California desk. If you're interested in applying, please 
contact Amy FitzPatrick by (INSERT DATE HERE).

Following is a summary of the responsibilities associated with this position:

To facilitate the entry of West Power deals, including short term and long 
term desks and the services desk, into the trading systems.
Follow-up with Deal Clearing Settlements groups in Houston to verify accuracy 
of trades in the system.  This includes timely follow-up with the traders for 
clarification. 
Ensure that all trades are entered by a daily deadline.
Calculate and report weighted averages of daily price and volume to Dow Jones.
Prepare and distribute daily reports to ensure all books are balanced and 
report discrepancies to management.
Track and report daily and monthly error discrepancies to management and 
deliver reports for possible solutions to rectify errors.
Calculate weighted averages between brokered trades and trades executed 
through Enron OnLine and the Intercontinental Exchange.
Report any technical mishaps to appropriate personnel in Houston and track 
computer problems until demonstrated resolutions.
Test any updated versions of applications requested by programmers and report 
back any adjustments needed.

The most important attributes one must possess to succeed in this position 
are persistance and a positive attitude. Working knowledge of Microsoft Excel 
is essential, as is a general software aptitude.

How does that sound? Let me know if you need more.

Thanks,
Kate

According to Les, we don't need to confirm any of these deals. I guess they 
were deals done by the Real Time desk on behalf of Services, but they were 
entered incorrectly. Thanks for checking, though.

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when

Sorry for the confusion, Geir. When I got the e-mail from Houston it gave me 
the deal numbers and your name - I didn't even look in the comments section. 
My fault! If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname, that

Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic "mediocre." Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out "Traffic" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's "Cinema Paradiso" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. "Traffic" will cost twice as much as "Cinema," but 
the theater showing "Cinema" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at "Traffic." Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

Kate

compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

"Croupier " I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's "Manhattan," an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
"flaky"?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not,

 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy

WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, 
admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. "I know energy 
is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but 
other than that, I'm in the dark," Abraham said. "I was hoping to be 
appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but 
that one was already taken." The former Michigan senator said he plans to go 
to the library Thursday to look up "Energy" in The World Book Encyclopedia.

I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the 
future?

Thanks,
Kate

Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal 
numbers that concern your desk in red. I know these are really nitpicky 
errors, but it might be worth reminding these guys of the correct 
counterparty names.

Kate Symes
Student No. 569430668

1. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for 
potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This 
would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. 
As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would 
actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement 
is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price.

2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 
bottles of soda.
b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both 
allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction.
c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me 
indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I 
have 100 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one 
bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 200 bottles of soda - I would need 
AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle 
with the same frequency of use.

3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel 
with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs 
associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the 
highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next 
vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could 
actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be 
directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it 
would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of 
transportation.

4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as 
safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers' 
choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no 
auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. 
In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy 
a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because 
of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to 
choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot 
point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other 
incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive 
to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds, 
indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them.

5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price 
just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of 
by $12.50.
b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a 
gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a 
gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2. 
c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it 
wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50.

6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him 
to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build 
a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.)
b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of 
time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build 
a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5 
to 2.)
c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to 
1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster 
(rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.

7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96. 
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P
 53P = 210
 P = 210/53
 $3.96

The quantity is 188 textbooks.
 -10 + (50)(3.96) = 188
 200 - (3)(3.96) = 188
 188

b. The sticker price becomes $6.79.
 -10 + 50(P-3) = 200 - 3P
 -10 + 50P -150 = 200 - 3P
 360 = 53P
 P = 360/53
 $6.79

The market quantity stays at 188 textbooks.

c. The sticker price becomes $3.79.
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3(P+3)
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P - 9
 201 = 53P
 $3.79

Market quantity decreases marginally to 179 textbooks.
 
d. If the seller pays $3 per book in taxes, the seller charges $6.79 and 
receives $3.79 per book. If the buyer pays $3 per book in sales tax, the 
buyer pays $3.79 per book. The costs are equal despite which party is paying 
the tax.

e. The government collects $564 ($3 tax times 188 books) in tax revenues for 
this set of terms.


8. a. The equilibrium price is $42.
 -10 + 5P = 200
 5P = 210
 P = 42

The market quantity is 200.

b. The sticker price becomes $210 - t.
 -10 + 5(P-t) = 200
 -10 + 5P + 5t = 200
 P = 210 - t

c. The government takes in a tax revenue of 200t. There are deadweight costs 
associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand 
for insulin. Therefore, consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax.

9. a. Affects supply; supply curve will increase; price and quantity 
exchanged will increase
b. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will decrease
c. Affects supply: supply curve will decrease: price will and quantity 
exchanged will decrease
d. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
e. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
f. Affects demand: demand curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
g. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
h. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will increase

Just a heads up.  We have targeted tomorrow, March 1 as the start date for 
confirming the daily deals in the west.  Please remind the guys that we will 
need the counterparty contact filled in to prepare the confirmations.  If 
they absolutely do not have a contact, they may use the Documentation 
Department as a contact if this is available.  We are in the process of 
getting this name available for use for most the counterparties.

Subject: New Broker: Automated Power Exchange

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

Kate deal 559066 is identical to deal 559091.  Prebon does not recognize

BLOOMBERG
Matt Motley
559091 - sells to Idaho, 50 mw, April, Mid-C, $358

Tom Alonso
559010 - price is changed to $160
He is still entering last two deals.

AMEREX
Mike Swerzbin
559062 - buys AEP, 25 mw, Cal-02, PV, $140
And Tom said he didn't have anything to do with this deal - Mike said MW were

I spoke with Sean Crandall, who told me that from his standpoint the deals 
ARE separate; however, John Malowney is the mid-marketer who works with 
Conoco, and he told me that this special language is fine to include in the 
confirmations for these deals. Turns out I was just asking the wrong person. 

Let me know if you need comments added in these deals.

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the "special 
phrase" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Thanks

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

To re-cap:
I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

Mark -
I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these 
discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that 
shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their 
spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still 
wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and 
price. 

The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I 
answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also 
asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet 
and EnPower. 

Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.

Dave, 
Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I 
believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against 
PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just 
holler over here whenever you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.


     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

     Thanks,
     Kroum

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped 
from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at 
about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 
6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a 
cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I 
definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by 
my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
cocktails. All in all, though, great party.

Don't worry about it. Actually, I kind of like to know what the schedulers 
are dealing with, as oftentimes in the thick of things they're too busy to 
explain to me why and how something I do affects them. It's all about the 
chain reaction in this place, I'm beginning to notice. Heaven forbid I was 
the weak link!

Will - 

I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group 
manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss 
problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked 
with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real 
Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or 
someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me 
know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.

Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)

I was alerted this morning to the urgency with which certain people in the 
Portland office need this information; so I think it might help if they were 
added to the e-mail list for name change/merger notifications. Following is 
the list of Portland West Desk employees to add:

Kate Symes
Carla Hoffman
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Phillip Platter
Jeremy Morris

Thank you so much for your help.

We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in 
the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean 
he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out 
though!

I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just 
obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed 
herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a 
"natural healer" and he's also had "an experience with Jesus," so this one 
should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and 
basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both 
know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the 
bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my 
description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause 
it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired 
this week that I've been spouting out sentences like "The red computer needs 
to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong." It's 
definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right 
now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks 
like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. 
I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but 
sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. 
Hang in there - and call me soon!

Love,

Hey buttface!

Wow - it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to
mine (except that you probably don't fear for your life quite as much).  Who
is paying for Amber to come to Denver?  It sounds like she might be a little
out of her mind right now, but at least she's not going back to Chris just
yet.  So are you going to Seattle this weekend?  That sounds so fun!  I am
so jealous - parties, dinners, wine, men.  You and I are NOT living the same
life right now.  I am in the process of trying to break things off with the
ugly dresser, which was proving to be difficult until last night, when I
made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I.  Kate,
I was scared.  It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho
people I know.  Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at
inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point.  It was
excruciating!  It made Michelle look almost normal.

Not much else going on.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?  We need to dish.

Luego,
Anna

Subject: Re: Rockin in the Rockies, bro



So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no 
confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

Kate

These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
contact info.

Thanks,

This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim

498837 has been changed to Natsource.

499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log 
and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB 
look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.

Thanks for following up on this, Melissa. I've forwarded your e-mail on to 
Chris Foster and asked him to discuss the counterparty name with Bob Ellery, 
his contact at Sierra Pacific Holding Co. I'll let you know which name we 
need (or if we need one at all) as soon as I hear back from him.

Thanks again,

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was 
told that they should be set up in our system as Sierra Pacific Industries, 
Inc.  The contract has the long name on it so I am planning on asking Rhonda 
Denton about this tomorrow when she comes in.  I am not sure if it will work 
this way or not.  If you know anything else about this let me know.  Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

I will let you know what Rhonda says tomorrow.  
Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: New CTPY Request

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the 
confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on 
these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him 
your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed 
on this. Please let me know how I can help.

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

Kate

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet 
outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two 
deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals 
recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones 
index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.

The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The 
worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.

The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was 
entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. 
I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. 
If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III 
and me.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Thanks,
Kate

DUDE! You're too good to be true. Between you and my roommates, the emanation

Hey lady!

What's up?  I just had the most hectic week of my life!  I had such a great
time with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time you
see him?  He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesome
restaurant and totally paid for everyone.  I was so touched, especially
since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.  My car is great!
It's so little and perfect.  Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward
Bound weekend, which was incredible.  We went snowshoeing, did a ropes
course, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun
- I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).  Anyway,
I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind of
complicated, but super fun.  I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even more
convinced that this is the right job for me right now.  Nathan is still good
- I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a good
sign.  He's great.

So what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance!

Love, yo sista

I've changed both of these. Thanks a lot for the info - you know, I went

593969 and 593970

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with "the" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

Thanks!

That's funny, because that's the guy who Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley told 
me agreed to ADP the deal. I just gave him a call, but no answer. I'll try 
back in a bit, but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts 
supposedly already agreed.

Thank you! 

The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?

Thanks again for your help.

Kate

Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
for the hassle.

I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the 
Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole 
term of the deal.

404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index

512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index

Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE 
delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals 
with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered 
correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know 
if you have further questions.

I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and

Please let me know if you have questions or would like me to talk to someone 
at Bloomberg about this. I'll also check with Tim to find out if the fee 
change was ever negotiated with Enron.

To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning:

Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't 
know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect 
on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.

Bell, Alexander Graham 

                b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh
                d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova 
Scotia, Can.

                Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor 
of
                the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been
                recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech 
correction,
                with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing 
through
                nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two 
brothers were
                trained to continue the family profession. His early 
achievements on
                behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before 
his 30th
                birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.

                Alexander ("Graham" was not added until he was 11) was the
 second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds 
Bell. Apart
 from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High 
School (from
 which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh
 University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family 
trained and
 self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in 
Elgin, County
 Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 
he
 became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted 
his
 first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he 
would
 continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.

 In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge 
while the
 senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older 
brother from
 tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain 
of his
 professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their 
only surviving
 son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after 
settling near
 Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved.

 In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the 
system of
 his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching 
speech to the
 deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of 
speech such
 as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate 
the sounds of
 speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be 
known,
 showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. 
His
 astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture.

 Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments 
with
 sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of 
the deaf,
 edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and 
tutor; in 1873
 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University.

 Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and 
inspire Thomas
 Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him 
enthusiastically
 in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long 
nightly
 sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders 
and Mabel
 Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with 
the
 young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. 
Nevertheless, during
 normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy 
schedule of
 professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again 
suffered. On
 April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but 
after another
 exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while 
maintaining his
 daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in 
Canada to
 recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the 
telephone.
 On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent 
Number
 174,465 covering "The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or 
other
 sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in 
form to the
 vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."

 Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, 
the first of
 hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone--until then all too often 
regarded as a
 joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of 
the most
 involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early 
actions were
 the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company
 successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph
 Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially 
painful
 to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which 
persisted
 throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as 
the first to
 conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 1877 Bell married Mabel 
Hubbard, 10
 years his junior.

 The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in 
many ways
 it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his 
experiments in
 communication, which culminated in the invention of the 
photophone--transmission of
 sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for 
teaching speech
 to the deaf.

 In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs 
(roughly
 equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in 
association with
 Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the
 Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax 
cylinders
 and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound 
recording. Bell's
 share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American 
Association to
 Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham 
Bell
 Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his
 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking 
ceremonies for
 the new Volta Bureau building--today an international information centre 
relating to
 the oral education of the deaf.

 In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in
 surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a 
summer
 home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories.

 In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National 
Geographic
 Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he 
sought to
 promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was 
limited to
 a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his 
future
 son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational 
journal
 reaching millions throughout the world.

 As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the 
century, he
 experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again 
found a
 group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an 
inspiration,
 Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the 
group, soon
 founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization 
established
 and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor 
Bell. At
 Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar 
detection,
 solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil 
craft, one of which
 weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per 
hour
 in 1919.

 Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never 
lingered on
 one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than 
on
 refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows 
marginal
 memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at 
hand--reminders of
 questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to 
carry each
 of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions 
are only today
 seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The 
range of his
 inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in 
his name
 alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the
 telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for 
aerial
 vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell.

 Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his 
journal. During
 his last dictation he was reassured with "Don't hurry," to which he replied, 
"I have to."

These are all West Services deals, and our services traders - Les Rawson and 
Stan Cocke - prefer to confirm their own deals with counterparties. So these 
should not be confirmed. Kim Hundl and I have been working on long lists of 
deals that went in to be confirmed and we've since gone in and changed them. 
Services, Real Time, and EES trades are among those. If you'd like, you can 
talk to her about what we decided to confirm and not confirm, or you can give 
me a call at (503) 464-7486.

Thanks for checking!

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance 
in getting this deal out of the "New Counterparty" void.

The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute

Bob -
Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could 
help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. 
It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of 
PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through 
Cal'09. 

I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones 
indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index 
needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I noticed that deal # 253768 is an index deal with EES that has not 
been changed from the CAL PX to the Dow Jones index.  Could you ask Valerie 
or Bob Badeer if this deal should be changed?  I was going to send them a

Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday. It was 
undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI 
position. Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other 
EnPower" deals. Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2 
sheet. This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI. 
And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.

Per Greg Wolfe and Valarie Sabo:
Do not verbally confirm these deals. Greg Wolfe is preparing a confirm letter 
himself. Sharen Cason was handling this account with Greg Wolfe, John 
Malowney and Valarie Sabo yesteday, so she would have more detailed 
information. 

Let me know if that does it!

Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept "sticking it 
out another month" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really "your kind of town." In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
"Brian's Trip to Portland." It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile "the rest of our lives" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, "Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans." Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate

I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been

but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might 
finally have the futures figured out. Now, instead of one deal number with no 
counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the 
correct number of MW in each. Imagine that! Here is the updated information:

467455
10 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Southern Company Energy Marketing
Mark Watson

469098
50 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Sempra Energy Trading
Chris Bennett

I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate

I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the 
population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've 
been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the

Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I 
checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, 
and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes 
this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct?

Jeff Richter - all deals are on peak - do not recognize Sunday off-peak hours

Chris Mallory - 523831 changed to Bloomberg deal

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is

Tom says this deal was firm energy, but it is transmission contingent. When 
Tom did the deal with FPL, he said he wouldn't buy it unless the energy was 
firm. The power has already been delivered, however, so Tom said it shouldn't 
matter what kind of energy the confirm has, so for the sake of getting it 
done, he said just to agree with what they have in their confirmation. Does 
that make any sense? And the same goes for deal 516506.

He is still disputing the price (where Enron shows $90 and FPL shows $95 in 
deal 517520), and he's expecting a call back from Jeff Wallace on that.

Thanks,
Kate

Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent. Could you ask him

Just confirmed with Mike. Broker is correct - 25 MW. I'll change this deal 
when Risk is done with their calculation.

Thanks,

I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney, 
because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday. Cara asked me to 
e-mail you with the specifics for any scheduling adjustments that need to be 
made. And here they are -

563929 - KILLED

476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April

Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the 
on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs. Let 
me know if you have any questions.

Here is the information I received back from IT in Houston regarding the 
Forward Obligation Report. It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate 
way to run the report is showing only term deals. The "Schedule" and 
"Liquidate" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and 
therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, 
which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let 
me know what you think.

Thanks,
Kate

    Hi Diana & Kate,


    You are not wasting our time, you make our time valuable. You should be 
able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,
    if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes 
insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which
    Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things 
like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.

   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) 
data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with
   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule 
data should be very much the same with all the changes
   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and 
liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and
   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain 
data from 3/22/2001 to 4/5/2001, and the liquidation
   the same data from 4/2/1996. 

   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule 
between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule
   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk. I hided the check box to avoid 
confusions. The option Show Desk is very simple, changes the format
   of the header for Region, nothing else.

Kroum,

I was running the new version of the Obligation Report.  I was not included 
in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still 
not doing what the "fix" was initiated for.  Originally, my discussions with 
Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any 
changes made in Deal Scheduling and  2.  All Desk to Desk deals.  Number 
(2),   I believe was the difficult one.  When selecting the option on "Show 
Deals"  in order to capture schedule changes you must select "Liquidate".  
This does work, but it does not give you the option to select "Show Desk to 
Desk", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.  Please 
contact me for further discussion.  I apologize for not participating and 
wasting your time.  

Sincerely,

Diana Scholtes

Subject: Forward Obligation Report Question

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Thanks,

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from 
EPMI to EES
 (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less 
than weighted average, making it $177.27)

552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices 
reflected in my worksheet 
 Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is 
Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, 
not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the 
real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals 
they've done on EES's behalf. 

Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss 
it person to person.

Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make 
sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make

deal.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no 
confirm"? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

So, I got the scoop from Phil, and he says that YOU called him and told him 
the Riverside deal would be decreased to .55 from the usual .8 - go figure! 
Also, it looks like Jeremy just missed the .8 mw of generation in the 4/15 
and 4/16 sheets, which in turn I did not include in your sheet. I've revised 
it and attached the spreadsheet, but please let me know if you have any other 
questions.

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan

Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart 
Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today. I've 
spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because 
the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port 
of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms 
Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday. Deal number is 533916. Thanks for 
waiting.

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

#533919
#533931
#533932

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
starts moving around.

Stay well!

that mean that everyone pre-ordered? That would leave me "sans hotdog," which

Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always 
nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive 
something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate 
attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I 
am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the 
urgent ones.

Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick 
survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly 
and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through 
some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint 
colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our 
exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we 
could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a 
movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia 
story. We did watch two fabulous films - "The Virgin Suicides" and 
"Croupier," both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of 
couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. 

Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was 
amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked 
into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than 
disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more 
volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure 
somebody lives there now.

I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In 
my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery 
in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll 
let you know when I hear from him.

Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great 
company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make 
plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky 
for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. 

Take care,
Kate

I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the 
purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your 
hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia 
story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day 
here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At 
some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the 
lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. 
?
Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting 
me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming 
down for dinner next weekend. Stay in touch,
jordan

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following

Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents 
to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and 
therefore didn't need either. Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from 
BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell.

Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards. I was in a hurry to get 
them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details. I hope it didn't 
cause too much confusion.

RE: 468302

Sean Crandall just changed this deal to reflect only a December term. Prebon

We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still 
recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if 
Prebon still disputes.

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

A suggestion:

One of the most interesting books I've read recently is called "The River 
Why," by David James Duncan. I believe he's from the Pacific Northwest. It's 
about fishing and religion. Check it out.....if your gigantic FINANCE brain 
can fit it in.

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in 
those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going 
really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it through 
most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain "lows"). Amber 
tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how 
they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be 
on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, 
being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do 
not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania" anymore. And Monica tells Marky 
who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. 
It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, 
girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It 
pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking 
into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its 
clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed 
energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of 
gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three 
Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely 
less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and 
simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, 
sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly 
and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few 
months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy 
just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods 
with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, 
where's my car?", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load 
off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your 
head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old 
beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and 
suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. 
Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I 
just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from 
work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get 
serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies 
and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found 
my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a 
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington 
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it 
get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for 
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in 
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not 
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. 
As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much 
energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm 
having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the 
time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 
million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of 
my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour 
of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a 
finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for 
it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a 
weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the 
Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you 
can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll 
call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

Surprise, surprise - Mike checked with his broker at Amerex, who said he has 
April written down for this trade. Mike asked him to re-confirm with his back 
office. The contact in this deal is Bert Dunn, if you need to give them a 
name of someone to speak to.

Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we 
ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or 
myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible.

Thank you - 
Kate Symes

Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing 
contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I 
believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is 
working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these "deals," but as is 
so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they 
slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done 
tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we

Yes, deal should have zero volume. Looks like Jeremy just didn't have time to 
kill it so he zeroed it out. I'll kill it, but in the meantime, it's not a 
real deal and doesn't need to be confirmed.

I've changed this to BP Energy - and I was wondering - didn't BP Amoco change 
over to BP Energy? Do we ever trade with the old counterparty name anymore?

I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really 
indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things 
for the holidays, so I have one modification to make. If I could take off 
from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my 
parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with 
which parents. It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before 
-  the 22nd and the 2nd. I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I 
wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't. Thank 
you!

Kate

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Our fax number is 503-464-3740. You can send those deal numbers over whenever 
you get a chance, and I'll look them over and talk to the appropriate traders 
and IT. Thanks so much for your diligence during this transition. I'll keep 
you informed on the IT effort.

Subject: "no confirm" deals

Hi Kate!
I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar 
because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of 
deals that need to be changed to "no confirm."  I'd like to fax a list of 
them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to "not to 
be confirmed" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to 
enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to 
get these deals to automatically be "no confirm" when the traders enter 
them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the 
logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know 
your fax number so that i can send you this report.  
Thanks!

Joanie!
I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to 
the Enron devil. In fact, I have no time to be writing this e-mail right now, 
but I've been meaning to drop a line and catch up with you. I also just ran 
into Brigdet (from the class below us at SMA) at lunch - apparently she's 
married to some baseball player. Crazy! So right away I had to contact my 
ever-realistic "single" friend to bring me some sanity. I'm actually dating a 
guy right now, but it still gives me the chills to hear about anyone near my 
age walking down the toilet...I mean aisle. Anyway, call me, or I'll call you 
tonight - let's dish! I hope everything's great with you - I expect nothing 
less. I have lots of interesting stories to tell about how and why I've come 
to the decision that I'm sending my roommates to rehab.

Love,
Kate

Bob Badeer changed the time zone in one of these deals - apparently that's 
what was throwing off the MW totals. So 458406 and 458405 should match now. 
Please let me know if there is anything else.

It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone. 
But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone. Could you check 
your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the 
strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?

Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone:
534074
534072
534071
534053

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  


Thanks!!

Okay, I don't know where Jeff's head was today, but he just checked with

it - Deal #461171.

This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we 
should be able to clarify this.

Looks like Mike Driscoll's Deal Blotter defaults were wrong - this has been 
changed to firm energy.

508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

After a little more digging, I've found that the deal NYMEX was referring to 
is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of 
our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. 
Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a 
payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. 
So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that 
payment would be made today.

Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with 
ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities 
to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this 
directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is 
(212) 299-2146.

Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, 
at (212) 859-1212.

As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo 
Verde futures contract has been paid, and paid on time. I'd like to speak 
with John at NYMEX to tie up any possible loose ends on this. Please let me 
know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

For some reason, the time management function on eHRonline won't allow me to

Tom's in a meeting, but in his trade log he has APS crossed out and over it 
he's written Pinnacle. So I'm going to wait to find out what happened. I'll 
let you know.

>From my understanding from Rhonda trades can still be done under APS or

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book 
one more spa reservation for Jean Gonnella. The only time Jean can do it is 
between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the Thursday they arrive. She would like a deep 
cleansing facial and a french manicure. If there isn't time for both, she'd 
just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when 
you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks!

P.S. I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck. I would have taken care 
of this myself, but Mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on 
Tuesday morning. Good luck, and let me know if you need help.

Chris -
Here's the latest I've heard on our request for a new counterparty name 
(Sierra Pacific Holding Co.) to be added to EnPower. I faxed the master 
agreement to Melissa Murphy so the Confirms group could reference it; then 
she passed the pertinent information along to Samuel Schott in Global 
Counterparty, whose job it is to set up new counterparties. But it looks like 
your contact at Sierra is saying this deal should be done with Sierra Pacific 
Industries - the parent company - rather than Sierra Pacific Holding Co. 

Do you have a preference either way? Maybe you could contact Bob Ellery and 
discuss this. Just let me know which name to add to the deal.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, Samuel Schott in Global Counterparty called this company and he was

Pacific Industries, Inc. is in Enpower but I am not certain if we should use 
that name.

Finally! This deal has been deciphered and changed. I killed legs 3 through 
7, which were all inadvertantly entered as forwards instead of index 
forwards. I checked on the Dow Jones Palo Verde index price for those days - 
10/3/00 through 10/7/00 - and verified that 5% was greater than $5.00. Legs 2 
and 8 already reflected the 5% offset, not $5, so I didn't change anything on 
these. The new leg numbers are 420886.52 through 420886.56. If there are any 
further changes to be made, please let me know. Otherwise, thank you so much 
for your patience and cooperation.

Kate

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

I've added the fee - these are supposed to default when traders enter the 
deals in Enpower, but for some reason Bloomberg fees aren't coming through 
lately. I'm checking with IT on this.

Thanks,
Kate

PS - I'll add you to the Deal Correction Report mail list starting today.

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,

FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.

I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers 
around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a 
discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.

She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Mom -
I know how if feels when things start building like that. I'm finding that 
"alone time" is really the only way to cope - especially during the holidays. 
But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry 
that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed 
just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in 
much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do 
something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything 
else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm 
typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to 
know that no one has it anymore together than you do.

Kate

Subject: California Energy Crisis

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso 
wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused!

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with 
EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

Thanks,
Kate

BLOOMBERG
Are you talking about the broker fee?
Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these 
deals.

PREBON
Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with 
Prebon?
I guess this is o.k. but they were insisting that this deal was done with 
Matt not Bob.

Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a 
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

Kate

Mike Driscoll just talked with the broker, and they agreed to the price Enron 
has - broker will change the checkout sheet now. Sorry for the confusion.

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Thanks,

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Two of these should have fees; two should not.

Add .0075 broker fee to:
477212

Add .005 broker fee to:
474434

No broker fee on:
468440
468444

This is per Matt Motley's trade book. I'll change the fees in the deals; and 
if you have questions about the deals with no fee, let me know and I'll call 
Matt to verify.

I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the

Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it.

I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
of the day, right?)

Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.

Thanks so much,
Kate

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thanks,

I wanted to introduce myself and let you know that the Portland West Desk has 
a new person in Deal Control. I'm sure you know from working with Carla 
Hoffman that the position requires quite a bit of communication with your 
group regarding Enpower program development; so if there is anything I can do 
to facilitate the speed or success of your tasks, please let me know. 

The first Enpower question I have is regarding the Enron Online Report. 
Apparently Carla had requested a few changes, which were then put into a 
stage version of the program. I'm wondering if we can get that report into 
production, and more importantly, if we can make a few more minor changes to 
it. Right now I'm running reports by logging on as Carla, which is fine, but 
eventually we'd like to see the EOL report up and running for everyone to use.

I know that Carla and Nicolay have worked on it in the past, and I think it 
would be relevant to talk with them about issues and obstacles they found in 
the report. I look forward to meeting you (via telephone or otherwise!).

Thanks,
Kate

When the contract is fully executed, just forward it to me in interoffice 
mail.  I do have questions about the name that the contract has been written 
under and the name that the deals are under in Enpower.  Sierra Pacific 
Industries, Inc. is in global counterparty and the deals have been changed in 
Enpower to this CP.  The problem is that the contract and the confirms will 
not agree as to who is the correct CP.  We have always confirmed deals under 
the name of the entity with whom we have a contract.  Please let me know if 
the name will be changed on the contract to reflect the correct CP or will we 
amend the contract to add "Inc." to the end of the name and set up this dba 
in global counterparty.  I need to know before we can confirm these deals.

In additiona, Geir has entered a transmission deal for this CP.  578812.  
Should this be a buy/resale?

I just heard from Samuel (thanks for your message!) that I need to send 
Rhonda new counterparty information in order to get their names added to the 
system. I called Rhonda, but it turns out she's out of the office for the 
first part of this week, and her voice mail referred me to Melissa. (That's a 
short explanation of why I'm sending this info. to all of you.)

Anyway, following is the information connected with the new counterparty name 
Chris Foster has requested:

Name: Sierra Pacific Holding Company, dba Sierra Pacific Industries
Address: PO Box 496028
    Redding, CA 96049
Or: 19759 Riverside Ave.
      Anderson, CA 96007
Phone: (530) 378-8179
Fax: (530) 378-8139
Contact: Director of Energy Resources - Robert Ellery

I also have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you'd 
like me to fax that over. Just let me know how I can help. We've already 
entered Chris's deal into the system with "New Counterparty," so the sooner 
we can change that the better.

Thanks,
Kate

Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an 
update:

The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be 
finished at noon.

So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency. I've left a message 
at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for 
the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault 
and Jim Fell tomorrow.

I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is 
that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I 
thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys. 
Nothing to worry about, though. You can now resume your poolside position.

Kate

That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again. 

Thanks for the suggestion,

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL

which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the "cash balance 
plan"? When I pull up my account information from the "Savings Plan" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

Amy

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in

I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.

534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 
mw per hour

559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak 
hours
559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak 
hours

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the 
end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones 
index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the 
exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not 
entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not 
change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES 
daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.

Thanks for your patience,

We would like to know the approximate number of attendees for the morning 
sessions, so please be sure to let me know which of the two sessions you are 
interested in attending.
The afternoon session will begin at 1:00pm, rather than 12:00pm
In order to keep the "flow" of traffic moving through Mt. Hood, please plan

Kate,

The best books I've read recently are 1) "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by 
Burton Malkiel and 2) Options, Futures, and other Derivatives" by John Hull.  
Put those in your pipe.

Both deals have been changed - 512924 has been changed to no confirmation. 
512929 has been given a contact name. And thanks for the update on daily deal 
confirmations.

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Thanks!

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate

I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said 
he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they 
are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.

The deal has been fixed. I'm so sorry about that - when I changed the dates 
at the top, the computer asked if I'd like it to copy the changes into the 
strips. I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly! 

And I will definitely add notes in the comments section of deals I change 
from now on. Thanks for the tip.

Kate

Whatever you changed on this deal, it now reads that it flows 32 hours a 
day!  You have five strips in, each flowing for 16 hours.

Also, when you change a deal, if you could make small note about what you 
changed in the comment section of deal entry, if really makes things go 
faster.  We know what change to look for when we make the revision.

Let me know when it is fixed.

Thanks!

Option terms are not reflected in the system. Trade date has been changed to 
2/22 - reflects trade date in CDWR confirmation letter. I've left a copy of

Sure - anytime. I usually do lunch around 11:30 - so I can get back in time 
to weather the afternoon storm! Let me know what works for you.

Kate

P.S. I hope you had a great birthday party on Saturday! I wanted to make it, 
but ended up on a terribly boring date instead. Go figure.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily

She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, can you please ask Holli if she has a copy of the following 
confirmation(s) Deal 420554.01, 420563.01 (probably confirmed together).  
Sharen Cason worked on the confirmation letter, but we never received a copy 
for our records.  Can you please send us a copy of the Confirmation Letter so 
we can properly scan the document in our system.  Thank you for your help.

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,
Kate

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Prebon agrees now because the confirm is exactly what we have, however, can 
you change both strips to reflect 3/15-3/31 in enpower (deal 549052).

We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still

Prebon still disputes.

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the 
meantime, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you know if 
anything else changes.

Thanks,

I've ordered the 1999 Annual Report for Scottish Power, as I noticed it was 
not in the company file. It should be here tomorrow or Friday at the latest. 
If you need the information sooner than that, I can download the report from 
the company's website, although the document is understandably bulky. Please 
let me know if you'd like a print-out.

Also, if you'd like, I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs. Mollie 
and I had discussed splitting the auction proceeds between two charities; in 
that way we can share the wealth and not inundate an organization with more 
than they can manage. It's something to think about in case CASA doesn't need 
much help.

Okay - I won't be able to get out of here before 5 p.m., so 6 p.m. might be 
better. Also, I am car-free these days, and I completely forgot you wanted to 
meet east of the river. Would it be too much trouble to meet in NE - that's 
where I live, and there aren't any buses directly from SE to NE, 
unfortunately. Let me know if this works for you. Sorry for the hassle!

The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?

Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. 
I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were 
aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to 
remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want 
special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Dad -
Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For 
my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming 
anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing 
club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?

Subject: Proposed date change for WSC Opening Day



After some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,  Marilyn and I would like 
to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 22. Our  reasoning is as follows:
?
1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be  a conflict for many WSC 
families. It's also just a week after the board chili  feed on Mar. 25.
?
2. Apr. 22 is the last Sunday of series sailing  before we go to evenings. 
It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather  are marginally better, 
and there are no conflicts that we are aware  of.
?
If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let  me know by Wednesday (we 
need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll  go with Apr. 22. 
Thanks,
?
Bill

I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume 
reports. He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now, but has 
requested it from staff at the exchange. He's not sure of the exact day he 
might begin receiving this report, but told me it would be sometime next 
week. I'll let you know when I find out. 

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or 
would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our 
volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,
Kate

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

I've modified these deals to read as follows:

572069
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
On Peak - 12 MW @ $245 for flow 4/6-4/7
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $150 for flow 4/7
TOTAL MWH = 480

576468
West Services buys from APX
NP-15
Off Peak - 12 MW @ $140 for flow 4/6
TOTAL MWH = 96

Please let me know if this is correct. (I hope!) And don't hesitate to call 
me with questions or other deal corrections. I will be running between two 
different desks today, so if you can't reach me at my regular extension 
(503-464-7486), I can be reached at 503-464-3823.

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next

Disregard my other reply - I don't know what I was thinking. Prebon was right 
on this. Both deals were 50 MW (not 25 MW like I said earlier!), and they 
were changed accordingly.

Sorry about the confusion.

Traded 11-13-00 Chris mallory
deal 457482 and 457481
Prebon shows 50 mw and we show 25 mw on each deal.
Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

Thanks

Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly

I know - it's amazing that in this age of technological wizardry we are 
forced to resort to some of the cheesiest hijinks known to man. Of course, if 
I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail 
birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of 
the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know 
what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 
I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should 
reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life 
around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check 
or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also 
use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, 
c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this 
bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) 
with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner. 

Love,
Kate

Leaf finished his shift at 6 a.m. today - he'll be back at 6 p.m. But I 
talked to Bill Williams about it and he saw the trade in the Real Time log,

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?

I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And 
as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what 
you're doing say, "I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A 
BISCUIT." And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to 
see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You 
should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just 
after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil 
it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, 
hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of 
advice for the day)

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff 
member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he 
expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. 

Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for 
today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,
Kate

Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with 
lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But 
otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the 
whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? 
You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin 
to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm 
rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the 
technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have 
several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have 
two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. 
And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner" 
of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland 
Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its 
employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are 
just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you 
some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of 
such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what 
George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next 
twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, 
that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you 
didn't notice that.

Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back 
office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK 
to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price 
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I 
wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where

I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems 
valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So 
to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal 
each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the 
expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and 
putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will 
take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll 
average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day 
average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - 
doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's 
just split between two deals temporarily. 

Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another 
comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should 
be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any 
point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward 
deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value 
properly.

Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you 
more than less!

Thanks,
Kate

Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for 
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out 
I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going 
to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being 
able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two 
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian 
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually 
good-looking farm workers.Tres important! 

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more 
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right 
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with 
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll 
keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I 
hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel 
really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with 
Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over 
and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other 
part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between 
her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it. 

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett 
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous 
and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on 
getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that other crap that goes 
along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise 
spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it 
last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, 
and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I have some 
kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, 
it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk 
and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back 
soon.

I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance

zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't "run into him".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
"donation" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing "Don's Mixed Drinks" - not sure, but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
"lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania"
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

I'm so sorry, gals, but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to 
health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the 
respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait 
until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. 
I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you

Evelyn, I'm so sorry I haven't found these deals yet! I've left messages with 
Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley, but I don't see these trades in either of 
their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. One of those guys should 
be back in the office momentarily, and I'll let you know when I've talked to 
them.

I've changed the term to 12/4, and I'm going to make a note in our daily deal 
correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for 
catching this.

That sounds like a good one, mom. Like I've said before, I think it's a great 
idea and would be perfect for you. Now I think you should start taking steps 
to make it happen. I know you could get your house sold, no problem. And you 
should think seriously about putting it on the market soon, as I'm starting 
to get the feeling it can take quite a while to actually sell a house. Let me 
know how I can help - for example, Brian has some friends who rent out a 
great cottage in Kihei for $100 a week. He can also get really good deals on 
rental cars. If you start shopping around for a cheap ticket now, you could 
take a scouting trip this spring and make plans to move by the following 
winter - just in time for whale-watching. 

Just do it!

Monica Lande also came up with a list of our outstanding deals with the PX. 
It contains most of the same deals that are found in your spreadsheet, and a 
few that aren't. Also, Bob Badeer has become the leader-by-default of this 
"project." Let me know if you'd like me to talk with him about our progress 
or have him call you. I'm not sure how involved you are, or how involved 
you'd like me to be, but I thought I'd keep you up to date on the happenings 
over here. Again, please let me know how I can help.

Kate-
    I'm going for a run..uh, walk in the park to unwind from another busy
day.  Did I already RE???  I think I was in process when I was abruptly
booted off my system.  I rarely read too deeply into the metaphysics of
internet territoriality, but let's just say I was a bit freaked out.
    In other news, I was invited, as a resident shoe expert, to come fix the
feet of a certain director on a certain Paramount movie set in town...and do
I feel important??  I'll keep you updated as to whether this particular 15
minutes of fame is actually THE one, or just a facade to a deeper and more
rewarding 15 minutes somewhere down the road.
    On Gatsby - don't have it yet and implicit in this status is my inability
to compete with one so driven to ultimate domination in the category of
intellectual enormity...I am the microscopic parasite to a four-limbed,
crafty predator that disguises itself, like a siren, as a mere passenger on
the food train.
    Miss you in a sort of in-town way. Perhaps we should get together and do
this in person soon?  I am worried about your little heart, my "playuh"
positioning, and wasting the short two month window that is inevitably the
range of my welcome.
    In the "get-on-with-it"  realm, I'm out.  Call me.  Home is 224-7243 and
cell is 890-6370 in case you've misplaced the card...or something.  Any
malapropisticism was incidental this time around.

Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems 
that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. 
Please call me with questions. 

This spreadsheet includes a missing purchase for total of 55 mw @ 195.00 on 
2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.


This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 
on 2/6. 



In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one 
strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been 
autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please 
let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the 
confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our 
lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down 
to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a 
message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called 
Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you 
still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone 
else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a 
note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out 
more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all 
this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.

need to specify whether or not they'd like the counterparty to see this 
special language; however, if deals get through to the Confirms department 
without specification in the comments section, I'd like to be notified. In 
this way, we can resolve the matter quickly and efficiently and hopefully 
avoid a larger problem down the road. 

Thanks for your help on this.

Kate

I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at 
Aquila to sort this out. We were both confused about the discrepancy, 
however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in 
scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this 
didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this 
afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Aquila noted on our confirmation, that they DO NOT KNOW TRADE IN SYSTEM.  
Lisa Robinson (back office at Aquila) said she asked her trader and he does

All of these deals are in the traders' books, and we're working right now on 
getting them in the system. Market is crazy, prices are insane, traders have 
been trapped in meetings all morning trying to get a handle on it. I'm sorry

The APX called me today.  They are concerned we are sending them confirms on 
deals that we are doing with them.  Legally this is incorrect as we are 
transacting purusuant to the APX Master, not the Enron Master.  So, please 
try to remember to check the box for no confirms when you transact with the

Thanks so much for getting back to me on this! I actually found the deal 
number (after suffering a small heart attack) and the signed confirmation in 
Livelink. It ended up being an Avista error that circled back to us. It's 
cleared up with all involved parties now, but it was a little scary for a 
minute there. Anyway, no need to do anything more, but thanks again for your 
response - and I hope you feel better soon.

Hi Kate!
I got your voice mail this morning (I was out sick yesterday).  I did a 
search based on the info you left in your vmail and got deal #531742.  Is 
this the deal you were looking for?  If so, this confirmation letter has been 
executed by Avista Energy, Inc.  Would you like a faxed copy of this confirm?

I'd like to introduce myself, as I'm sure we'll be in frequent contact in the 
coming weeks while I adjust to my new position at the Deal Control desk here 
in Portland. Please feel free to call or e-mail me with questions, concerns, 
alerts, or suggestions - I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this job 
and take it in new directions. So if there is anything I can do to make your 
jobs function more smoothly, let me know.

As a first order of business, thank you for the heads-up on the new version 
of Deal Entry. A couple of our schedulers have been experiencing delayed 
efficiency with the program  today - I'm not sure if that has anything to do 
with the new version or possibly our Terminal Server connection. Just wanted 
to let you know, in case anyone else has the same experience.

I look forward to working with you, and again, feel free to call me anytime.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?

Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

AMEREX

Diana/Sean
I am missing the following deal:
1) Enron sells to Powerex MId-C light 3/29 at $140.00


Chris Mallory
Amerex does not recognize deal 563362




BLOOMBERG
All deals are o.k.





PREBON

Chris Mallory
deal 563461
Is this a duplicate of 563460 because Prebon only recognizes 1 deal

deal 563358
Prebon says should be heavy not light hrs.

You're right, this was an Altra deal that was entered as Prebon. Only one

Kate can you check this fee with Mike Swerzbin for deal 514296.
Amerex says Mike agreed to $.015 however, Enpower has $.0075

I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it 
this afternoon. She says the deal is definitely not entered correctly, but 
because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she 
wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She 
said she'd reconcile it tomorrow, and we'll let you know what we've done then.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service 
Company." All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his 
SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to 
clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All 
four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:

493989
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
198.00
Mid-C

493988
Sell SCEM
Jun-01
195.00

Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, 
they're good to go.

According to all the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk, this trade was 
cancelled by Bloomberg. Let me know if Bloomberg still thinks it's good, and 
I'll have the traders call over there.

Thanks,
Kate

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest 
volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing 
between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an 
attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you 
see the changes come through, Mark. 

The autoscheduled deals are:

533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
535419 - 3/2/01
535420 - 3/2/01
566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
550208 - 3/15/01



The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES 
saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours 
should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the 
EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. 


+____________
=         1016.75 

Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the 
CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up 
for March!

Thanks,
Kate

Sean has fixed these - the computer picked up the off peak indices for the 
related deals - #465720 and #465723.

By the way, all our traders are inputting their deals now. I know you guys 
are checking out with brokers - we'll try to expedite the process.

Thanks,

Please note a change in EES reported load volume on 3/31, HE 6, SP-15. The 
volume was incorrectly copied into the worksheet, but all EnPower deals 
reflect the correct number. Also, the sheets for 3/30 and 3/31 now show those

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change 
yourself.  Do you want me to continue to let you know of these changes?  I 
know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.

I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston 
office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my 
information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said 
I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. 
Here it is:

Ext. 7486
Cell phone 819-2181

And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll 
send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I 
figured I'd let you know before I forgot.

Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no 
confirm"? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

This is a Tom Alonso deal; and it's for heavy load, and since 12/31 is a 
Sunday, the term will actually end on 12/30. I can change the end date in 
deal entry if that makes things less complicated; but either way the deal 
will end on the 30th. Please let me know.

As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased 
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships. 

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would 
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve 
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not 
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 



If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact 
Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Include the date 
of the games you would like to go to and the name of the customers you will 
be taking.

Details in exchange for this - 

I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking 
about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges 
since last spring: "We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are 
telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'" 
The lead of the story was this: "The California Independent System 
Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund 
the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since 
last May." 

First of all, tell me what the difference is between "overcharges" and 
"excessive" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this 
analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the 
lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically 
unattractive. 

Then you get details.

I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for 
our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has 
gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who 
talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully 
solve this once and for all.

You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially 
when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get 
a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I 
guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making 
sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy 
to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want 
everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.

Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

Thanks,
Kate

Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond 
the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to 
me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - 
we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the 
Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to 
Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching 
dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.

I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on 
Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went 
well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school 
reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at 
least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of 
overachieving Catholic girls.

I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete 
with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome 
concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to 
come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.

So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank 
you so much for such indispensible help.

I've left a message for Stewart Rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, 
to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana Scholtes said she 
thought he did, in which case I need to determine with him what kind of deal 
this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as 
soon as I hear back from him.

Thanks,

Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the 
audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this 
deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should 
have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the 
strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good 
enough for me.

Thanks again,
Kate

Here you go, Kim. I've added a couple more counterparty names to your list, 
and made a few minor changes that I thought might clarify the reasoning 
behind and origination of these "no confirm" deals. The one counterparty name 
I couldn't recall was Bonneville - do you remember who requested that we not 
confirm these? 

Please let me know if you have any questions on the additions.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

Hi everyone!

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our "not to be confirmed" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional "not to be confirmed" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks for your input,
Kimberly Hundl x31647

I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily 
deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.

Oops, and one more thing. The price on this is entered both in Jeff's trade 
log and in Deal Entry as $214.95. I verified that with Chris Mallory, who's 
working on the California desk today. If Prebon still has a discrepancy, let 
me know.

Thanks,

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate
(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look 
constantly busy)

I just talked with Mike, and he thinks this trade was made on the 14th, but 
possibly entered on the 15th and back-dated. He's coming in to the office in 
a few minutes and will call the broker to be sure. I'll let you know as soon

I thought it might behoove you guys to know about this, even though I am 
unclear as to its meaning myself. Basically, Cara made a change in scheduling 
that she did not change in Enpower, and it has to do with an ongoing deal 
being managed by the short and long term northwest desks. 

In addition, Carla and I zeroed out a deal for Diana Scholtes in scheduling - 
473338 - selling to Modesto at NP-15 for BOM on peak. For some reason, she 
just needed it zeroed out for tomorrow, so we did not change the deal in deal 
entry. If you have any questions, please let me know.

It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile 
- if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but 
there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version 
of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically 
populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave 
Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can 
save your part.

Thanks,

Thanks for checking. I changed this deal to reflect off-peak hours only. 

Also, Tom Alonso just let me know that deal #460678 actually has a Mid-C 
delivery point, not Palo Verde. I changed this as well, but wanted to let you 
know so you can re-confirm.

Hi Kate,
I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!

Melissa - I just wanted to let you know that I can definitely get this list 
to you today. I'm a little buried right now dealing with some IT issues we're 
having with the new Full Service Power application, Forward Obligation 
report, etc., etc., so it may take me a little while. Is it okay if I get 
this to you by 1 p.m. PST? Let me know.

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

This deal is a placeholder for our futures position that rolled off 
yesterday. We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups, which I asked Jason 
Fischer about yesterday. He said the broker wouldn't have those until today. 
I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly.

No. It looks like these are all the deals Christian Yoder and our other 
lawyers are working on. Christian is writing up confirms for these, and 
actually has a few of them done. He said he'd be contacting Sharen Cason and 
faxing her copies of the finished letters very soon.

Please let me know if you need me to add comments to these deals to make it 
more clear. I'm going to talk further with Christian and Val Sabo on my end 
to better understand what the DEAL is with these deals, because they've been 
plaguing me all day.

I'll keep you posted on the progress of this, but in the meantime you don't 
have to send revised confirms.

Thanks,

This was changed last night to SP-15, but Jeff forgot to change the index. 
It's been changed to DJ SP-15 Peak Index.

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

This deal discrepancy seems to have a few of us stumped - so I'm referring it 
to all of you in hopes that we can solve this today. Following are the terms 
of the deal:

Short Term California buys Enron Energy Services
Hours: HE 6-9
Delivery Point: SP-15
Term: 3/29/01
Price: $110

The deal was entered by Bert Meyers, a Real Time trader, on behalf of STCA. 
It was extended for HE 9 through 22 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet 
Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of 
$130, not a buy at a price of $160.  My first instinct was to simply modify 
the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the 
price coming across as $130. I'm reluctant to send any more incorrect 
information to EES, as we've already dealt with enough confusion over this 
matter. Please take a look at the deal and its corresponding documents, and 
let me know which is the correct price.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

I take that back - the deal contains liquidated strips and cannot be killed - 
that's why it's zeroed out.

Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. 
I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted 
to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with 
what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill 
Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to 
take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's 
probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, 
sorry for the delay.

I realize this is late notice, but it just occurred to me that I never 
discussed my Christmas vacation plans with you when I transferred into 
Trading. I have a family trip planned and paid for, so I hope it won't cause 
too much chaos if I'm gone. I understand the tendency for people to feel lost 
and helpless without me.

I'm supposed to be in California with my dad on Dec. 22, then in Mexico with 
my mom from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2. So I basically need to miss four days of work. 
Again, I'm sorry to bring this to you so late, and I'd be glad to do any 
amount of work before or after, or even spend my holiday entering deals on 
the computer in some exotic Central American internet cafe. I've heard 
they're great places to rage.

We can discuss the logistics when you're back in the office. And by the way, 
the flame in this e-mail does not indicate anger, but rather is meant to be a 
festive, joyous, holiday-time explosion.

Kate

Hello!

These deal have NP/SP delivery points with firm energy.
576522
576512
576523
576517
576513
and 576511, but this one is also the wrong CP name.  Reliant HLP doesn't 
trade in the west.  I think it should be Reliant Energy Services.

Thanks!

I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message 
as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these 
groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as 
efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I 
send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. 
The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report 
every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for 
the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have 
this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you 
the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can 
do to assist.

West Power Traders
Tim Belden
Matt Motley
Mike Swerzbin
Mike Driscoll
Bob Badeer
Sean Crandall
Diana Scholtes
Tom Alonso
Mark Fischer
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Jeremy Morris
Phil Platter

Again, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online. 
Our other groups - mid-marketing, origination, and fundamentals - do not 
trade online. I believe that development in San Francisco also does not trade 
online.

Thanks,
Kate

I've got one more deal that Houston says they haven't received a signed 
confirm letter for - 420529. Stephanie Piwetz says she spoke to Grant County 
and they said they already sent out that one and 432854, but haven't received 
them back from us......???? Do you know where they are?

Kate


(From 2/26/01)
Just something to keep in mind - 
The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
County for the following three deals -

432854
420554
420563

I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.

Thanks,
Kate

No problem. It occured to me, as the list of people I'm sending this to 
continues to grow, that maybe I should fine tune the format a little. If you

I just heard back from Holli Krebs, who verified that Puget is right on this 
deal - the term should be December through February. I've changed it in the 
system.

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

Thanks!

This is Mike Swerzbin's deal, Long Term Northwest desk, which he neglected to 
input before our risk group started calcing. It's in there now and the number 
is 474641.

And Bob Badeer just entered his TFS deals, so you should see those in there 
now.

Thanks for the in-depth information on our man of the hour, Ken Lay. I never

Subject: New Counterparty Name on #598391

Kate, this deal has a new counteparty but it is not in the system yet. Can we 
get more details on this, like what the actual name of MDEA is, address, 
contact, phone numbers etc. 

Thanks,

Kimberly

Sean has COB in his trade log. He originally had Mid-C, then crossed it out. 
Sounds like Amerex just hasn't updated their website with the change.

Mike Swerzbin did not get a confirm from the broker on these deals. They were 
two sleeves done with EES, and Driscoll just entered them. Thanks for the 
heads up. Any other questions, just give me a call or e-mail.

I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to 
change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could 
just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), 
when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can 
both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to 
wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. 
If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then 
feel free to change away!

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Rhonda -

I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower 
counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many 
different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the 
traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened 
because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, 
and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica 
Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've 
ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to 
stay in the system. 

I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. 
For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; 
Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just 
tests that are no longer used. 

Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an 
urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. 
Just checking.

Thanks,
Kate

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can 
put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it 
up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some 
lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow

Are you going to put the data in the sheet, or are you not able to do that.  
If not, just send the sheet to the file, and I will do it.

Also, I want to get with you about your daily deal data, because I want to 
run a Dow volume vs our volume data set daily.

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
Fischer deal?

Mike Driscoll input the deal for Swerzbin. He's sure it's Mid-C, because he 
wasn't trading any COB yesterday. He's having Prebon check their tapes, and 
they should get back to us in a minute.

Subject: Parking with El Paso tomorrow, 12/8/00

We are long in Enpower for tomorrow due to a parking arrangement with EPE at 
PV.     We added this deal late,  so make sure that the EPE dispatcher knows 
of this late preschedule of energy to EPE.
We are long the following hours/mws:

He 7-10    3mw's
He 11-22     10mw's

The length is reflected on deal #476644 and this energy should be marketed 
hourly.    We need to communicate early with EPE and make sure that this goes 
as smoothly  as possible.     Once sold,  of course enter the sale( under ST 
SW book)  and route to the length.
This deal is completely ST SW in Enpower and we will share any profits with 
ST SW.

Thanks,
JMF

I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin, the trader on these deals. They're 
both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change 
anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for 
confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.

517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to

We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is 
the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal 
that looked like "no bro" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually 
".015 bro." Anyway, that's probably more information than you 
needed.....sorry!

This deal is definitely on peak, says Matt Motley. It's a spread trade with 
Natsource, and both are logged in his book as on peak. Let me know if the 
broker still disputes this.

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

Subject: Dow Jones Index Prices - Database Access

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

I think I found what you're looking for:

www.ferc.fed.us

Once you get to the home page, click on the "gas" icon. From there, hit the 
link to the "FERC Gas Tariffs Page." Then it gives you a choice of viewing 
the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. 

I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is 
updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it 
bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking.

Mike said to just enter a new deal with these terms - deal is 539032, and 
I've backdated the trade date to 3/1. He's going to double-check the EES

is in there now.

you're up here you need to stay with me - we have a guest bedroom for gosh 
sakes. also, i met malia at a party the other weekend - talk about a freakin' 
small world! she was so sweet, but then i'm not surprised - she'd have to be 
to put up with you. (ha, ha) anyway, take care, call me soon, and toast my

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are

Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Mike still has about 6 deals to put in, and those are two of them. It should 
just be a minute. 

I'm killing a deal right now so my deal entry is tied up - who's the trader 
on 541368?

It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should 
have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
you. Let me know.

Kate

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Thanks,

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and

as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just

That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, "there's no way it's $258." So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

Kate

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there

I guess EVERYONE is going at a mad pace today, because we just checked with 
the Amerex broker, who said he's in the process of putting that second deal 
in - meanwhile his back office is trying to check out! What the...? So Amerex 
should see the second deal, identical to the first, any second. Let me know 
if they still don't check out.

Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.


Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions

file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.

It was great to run into you, too. This shrinking world never ceases to amaze 
me......to end up working in the same building, different industry, over a 
year later? Crazy. So, on lunch or a beer after work, just let me know the 
time and place. Lunch is a rarity with me, but I love to have an excuse to 
breathe fresh air in the middle of the day. And I need to plan ahead as well. 
I'll keep the week of the 22nd open - sound good?

Talk to you soon.

Don't worry about it! I got home and had to shower the day off of me, and by 
the time I got out Dave was (randomly) walking through the front door. Then 
he and my new roommate Chase and I all had tuna fish sandwiches and 
milkshakes for dinner. It was sooooooo good. And I am soooooo easily pleased. 
It's gorgeously sunny and warm here today, so I might have to go for a bike 
ride after work. Then I've got to ream Amber for being the most pathetic, 
loser roommate on the face of the earth (more on that later.) So we 
DEFINITELY need to talk. I'll call you tonight.

Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail. Also note

Yes, the correct name does include "Inc." at the end. And yes, Steve Hall 
said the master agreement works for this trade. He and Bob Ellery at Sierra 
talked over the agreement and decided to use the name that Sierra Pacific 
Holding Co. is doing business under. I've changed the deal (573679) in 
EnPower. Please let me know if you turn up any more questions.

Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -

Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
in EnPower.

Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance

I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.

Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

How does that sound?

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

This deal has been changed to an SP delivery point, but still has firm energy.

Thanks!

Transmission deals go through Arizona Public Service, not APS Energy 
Services. This deal has been changed. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

For anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true 
story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and 
totally worth the read: 

On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at 
a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband 
in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash 
the quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,"she told 
her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. 

As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already 
aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating 
figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob 
me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice 
gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She 
stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She 
hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was 
thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too 
obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a 
mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed 
with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned 
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, 
and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator 
didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about 
to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. 

Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor." Instinct told her to do what they 
told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and 
collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take 
my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. 

She heard one of the men say politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that 
floor you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who said it had a 
little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a 
belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. 

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. "When 
I told my friend here to hit the floor," said the average sized one, "I meant 
that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you 
to hit the floor, ma'am." He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious 
he was having a hard time not laughing. 

The woman thought: "My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself". She was 
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed 
her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving 
as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three 
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. 

When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to 
her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she 
might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. 
As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as 
they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled 
herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. 

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached 
to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: "Thanks for 
the best laugh we've had in years." It was signed; 

Eddie Murphy & Michael Jordan
