USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
"Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. "A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year." 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a "lagging" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or "junk"-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues," he said. "That is a positive for credit quality." 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
"We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
"Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits," said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a "death spiral" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or "shareholders' equity," by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a "sell" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
"Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story," Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a "buy" or "strong buy" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
"We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company," Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. "This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point." 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for "personal reasons." When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO." 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
"I don't know anybody who said that," Wasden said. "What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
"Enron has been a cult, more than a company," he said. "Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside." 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
"There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants," he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above "junk".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2" from "Baa1," and said it may cut Enron's "Prime-2" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered "difficulties in rolling over commercial paper," Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to "negative" from "stable."

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
"I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow," said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit," he said. "The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis." 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
"We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader)," said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
"Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem," said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow "purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market," according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
"I think if is too early to tell," Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. "As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron." 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. "At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions." 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
"Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine," he said. "This is a big case, by any means."

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiati=
ng with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, a=
nd is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar w=
ith the matter.=20
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and =
head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence=
. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped =
out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser=
ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=
ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i=
n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=
rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=
ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=
ts finances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=
is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=
illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =
it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=
drew Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=
tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=
nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=
ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=
oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=
aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=
dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was "getting a bit more resistanc=
e" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=
n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=
g, he said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=
 still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=
nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=
 Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=
r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=
onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =
week could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=
ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =
doing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in t=
he past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," h=
e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =
would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=
inances.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=
ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=
 show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confid=
ence in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the nego=
tiations for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=
trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=
ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=
 Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=
strates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=
ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=
y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=
re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=
ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=
, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=
 which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=
 the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=
's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=
onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=
es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =
and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=
elling stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=
nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =
than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=
 Energy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-ba=
sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=
cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=
d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=
y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=
rice then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=
nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=
nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=
ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=
 scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=
 troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=
re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=
 how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=
 they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=
eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=
rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =
energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=
 -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=
y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=
. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the m=
anaging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "ma=
nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=
s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was=
, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=
 -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=
g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =
when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=
ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=
r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=
n done.=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=
p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=
n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=
-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=
ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =
were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=
ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=
mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =
that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =
the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =
which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=
.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=
ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=
en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=
ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=
parency.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of=
 oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=
etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =
It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house=
 -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure inve=
stors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions invol=
ving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billio=
n in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today.=20
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $=
3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off c=
ommercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to =
convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a c=
ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or =
do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t=
wo weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting=
 this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac=
tions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced=
 by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it=
s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last wee=
k. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and =
it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i=
nquiry into its financial accounting.=20
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucia=
l to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. La=
tely, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and t=
wo major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the co=
mpany's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds=20
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mu=
tual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the hav=
oc may continue.=20
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embat=
tled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to =
fund tracker Morningstar.=20
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely =
to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's ha=
lving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders.=20
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholde=
r according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m s=
hares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn.=20
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at =
Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or =
5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last w=
eek on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships cre=
ated by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several l=
eading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron =
bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January.=
=20
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company i=
n which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with=
 large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are "dated", implying =
that the funds' positions in the company have changed.=20
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said manag=
ers of the group's larger funds had been "lightening up" their Enron holdin=
gs this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagshi=
p Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed=
 as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say wh=
en.=20
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also dec=

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=
e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=
ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=
ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=
ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=
growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=
ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=
er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily=
-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =
as it answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of A=
ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =
has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed=
 it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20
"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer=
, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=
riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor=
 relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=
e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to=
 have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =
cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic o=
n to old economy companies.=20
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey=
 Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =
develop energy trading.=20
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=
ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=
der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=
o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=
ing it.=20
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always=
 been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more=
 likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer =
in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =
his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=
ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A=
 management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=
, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=
mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=
elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was =
all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management m=
odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=
cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=
usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in=
 existing markets.=20
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =
Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=
e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed=
 jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=
sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr =
Skilling once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear you=
r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=
nt around here."=20
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =
in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=
atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=
limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=
he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world=
's leading e-commerce company.=20
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=
enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=
t service provider.=20
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive=
 of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power=
ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =
America and Boeing.=20
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=
hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he=
 abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=
th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=
ation.=20
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to=
 avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =
used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =
the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =
cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other =
financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =
and Azurix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moo=
re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=
y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=
al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=
ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=
o which it is exposed.=20
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=
nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management=
: "The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=
ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=
ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =
questionable."=20
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, =
stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=
lls," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants =
in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =
market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=
t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=
nergy business."=20
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=
ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=
on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=
ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=
ading volumes failed to materialise.=20
"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett,=
 a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=
y. "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=
oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=
e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=
nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=
arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=
f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=
ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=
sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =
of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.=
=20
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =
credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=
agement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team =
will have to tighten up.=20

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade b=
anks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fal=
l in its share price.=20
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board m=
eeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial di=
sclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its fi=
nancial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for=
 additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good fin=
ancial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have somet=
hing to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "establish additi=
onal lines of liquidity". "Once we are able to get the liquidity position s=
hored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest," Mr Palmer s=
aid.=20
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October =
16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders'=
 equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private=
 equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer,=
 who was forced to take a leave of absence last week.=20
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 a=
nnouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically =
"junk" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade.=20
"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abil=
ity to operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles =
of Salomon Smith Barney. "These activities require at least an investment g=
rade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requ=
irements."=20
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a req=
uest for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron fli=

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of invest=
ors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural ga=
s now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its busin=
ess dealings.=20
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its cr=
edit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial trans=
actions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the =
past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States i=
s not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the=
 market volatility that drove earnings last year eases.=20
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other p=
ower producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy.=20
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common them=
es affecting the industry.=20
"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. A=
nd two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven g=
rowth," Patterson said.=20
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some po=
wer companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. An=
d plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off.=20
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on=
 the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.=20
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED=20
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consec=
utive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said=
 Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off=
 assets.=20
"It's a different place," AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of=
 the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powe=
rful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Balt=
imore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trad=
ing operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation =
also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which=
 planned to make an equity investment in the company.=20
"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. econom=
y, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we wi=
ll be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver," said C=
hristian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman.=20
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES=20
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed empha=
sis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business=
.=20
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 8=
0 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it =
provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth,=
 according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise.=20
"Calpine does it already," he said, referring to the California-based indep=
endent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates c=
ontracted out. "What drove the valuations in all these companies last year =
was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were=
 low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case -=
 there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywh=
ere near that level," he added.=20
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices shoul=
d remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark sp=
reads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies.=20
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES=20
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning bac=
k to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line.=20
"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 200=
2 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward re=
vision of earnings guidance." said Patterson.=20
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second t=
ime to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off cer=
tain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America.=20
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge =
for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distr=
ibution units as well as other international investments.=20
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in t=
hird quarter earnings.=20
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards gett=
ing necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold it=
s unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time.=
=20
"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstr=
ated value can and will be created for shareholders," Allegheny said.

Enron Said Seeking New Credit Lines

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly ne=
gotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it dr=
ew down billions on its existing lines.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies wi=
th the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, w=
ith an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding "in addition=
 to derivatives and other structured product exposures," according to Goldm=
an Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loa=
n facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Secu=
rities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 m=
illion loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, =
the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also p=
articipated, Securities Data said.=20
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that "in order to dispel uncertainty =
in the financial community," it had drawn on its committed lines of credit =
to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal repor=
ted on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and =
was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line.=20
"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity --=
 that's nothing out of the ordinary," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode.=20
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the de=
parture of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange C=
ommission inquiry.=20
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy=
 trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and s=
ervices, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines.=20
"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested=
 along with Enron in some of its partnerships," said Ms. Applebaum. A spoke=
sman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did =
not know the amount of its exposure.=20
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. =
Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 milli=
on of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunT=
rust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, ac=
cording to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $10=
0 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also ha=
ve some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said.=20
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships wit=
h Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd =
, said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy gian=
t Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant.=20
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate o=
f Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning the=
rmal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island=
 of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other =
than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power mar=
ket," a Teijin spokesman said.=20
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last =
year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers.=20
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reduci=
ng domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It=
 is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus.=20
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's exis=
ting power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at=
 the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron.=20
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefi=
ed natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become =
the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan.=20
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility s=
tudy by June 2002.=20
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron?=20
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant =
energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pe=
rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif=
ornia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie=
ws would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron=
's arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons=
umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec=
tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, =
Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co=
mpany profited from creating new markets.=20
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th=
ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo=
ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'=
s the American way.''=20
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'=
s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar=
e mounting.=20
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company=
 worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt=
ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr=
on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge =
hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.=
 Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil=
lion in shareholder value.=20
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo=
w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and=
 soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende=
d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven=
ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w=
ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci=
ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn=
eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, =
to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl=
e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli=
ng could not be reached.=20
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its=
 shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi=
llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E=
nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission=
 is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques=
tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin=
g electricity and natural gas.=20
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall=
 in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie=
f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve=
rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem=
ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today=
 faces a potential cash crunch.=20
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer=
n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts=
 and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran=
sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to =
issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas=
h.=20
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On =
Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl=
y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w=
hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor=
tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that=
 any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev=
en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p=
roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili=
ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho=
ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou=
ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr=
onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the=
y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa=
id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the =
company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss=
ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee=
d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va=
luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th=
e company.=20
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader=
s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co=
mpany's sales and profits.=20
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But =
its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now =
offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon=
ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic=
e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl=
e downgrades.=20
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' =
said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at =
Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in=
 Kansas City, Mo.=20
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel=
iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin=
ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri=
city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r=
eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they=
 are closing their books down,'' he said.=20
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref=
ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also =
said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly =
to discuss the situation.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp=
any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o=
f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He =
said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j=
ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t=
he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street =
analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow=
n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin=
g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene=
trability of its financial statements.=20
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t=
o the questions investors ask.=20
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem=
ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly =
regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En=
ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g=
iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited =
and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr=
eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names=
 like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon=
ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp=
any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t=
he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the=
 difference.=20
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic=
er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold=
ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk=
impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, =
after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom=
issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq=
uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac=
tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have =
found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen=
ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it=
 reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e=
arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-=
down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a=
nd its shares rose.=20
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's=
 chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc=
e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal=
ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and=
 many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli=
de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so=
 far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved=
 investors.=20
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain =
the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou=
t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w=
ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a=
nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a=
bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them=
, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra=
sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a=
bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w=
e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c=
ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by=
 the end of next year.=20
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr=
on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o=
ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea=
l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c=
ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl=
arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very=
 near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha=
t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi=
ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note=
 after the call.=20
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it=
s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day=
, a higher-than-normal volume.=20
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil=
ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s=
aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt=
h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr=
on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea=
rs.=20
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance=
-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new =
shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha=
t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th=
at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign =
assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India =
embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t=
hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom=
y.=20
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their =
backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne=
sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when=
 management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc=
losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an=
alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money=
-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s=
ay.=20
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine=
ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r=
esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May=
 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these =
transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof=
itable.''=20
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa=
ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the=
 losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st=
ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture=
 of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip=
ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr=
ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, =
in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that=
 they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an=
d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully=
 lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform =
would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on.=20
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e=
lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track =
of specific transactions and prices.=20
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E=
nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one=
-quarter of all trading in the United States.=20
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e=
lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines=
s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and=
 their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen =
by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ=
ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev=
er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als=
o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co=
mpany, to move into the trading business.=20
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1=
990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe=
bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the=
 change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p=
rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i=
t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr=
oducts.''=20
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall =
Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first=
 transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi=
ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals=
 were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve=
ment.=20
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit=
 lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t=
o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t=
o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest=
ment-grade credit rating before that.=20
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s=
uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred=
it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s=
old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term =
to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma=
rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po=
sitions that should offset each other do not.=20
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact=
 the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the =
short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share=
 price, could rebound.=20
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take=
 advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor=
poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch=
ief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B=
ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir=
ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a=
nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu=
rrently available answers.=20
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it=
 said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse=
ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun=
ications companies.=20
Q. How did those investments do?=20
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos=
ure on that.=20
Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti=
ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati=
ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial =
disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement=
s completely.=20
Q. Why were they so complicated?=20
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a=
ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on =
transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each =
and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los=
s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha=
t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on =
the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa=
ll under that rule.=20
Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a=
ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears=
 that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything =
seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof=
its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl=
osed was not really important.=20
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th=
is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne=
rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate=
d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the=
 transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out=
 its deals with the partnerships.=20
Q. How did Enron do?=20
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact=
ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als=
o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Q. How did that happen?=20
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi=
p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr=
on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio=
ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s=
hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d=
etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re=
ported earnings.=20
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to =
say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to=
 enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t=
hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w=
hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

HOUSTON is known as the "Energy Capital of the World." And a glance around =

tributions to the view.=20
Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy c=
apital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed D=

Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more=
 than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon=
 gets to put its name on the structure.=20
The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space=

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liqui=
dity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, u=
sing $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.=
=20
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are comp=
leted the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell=
 to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before =
ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents.=20
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks nor=
mally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market=
, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion.=
=20
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below inves=
tment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an e=
arly default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will =
be able to sell more commercial paper.=20
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed t=
hat its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will sho=
w a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated=
 transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, =
who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wedn=
esday.=20
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement=
, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning lev=

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy pri=
ce for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plum=
meted.=20
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announc=
ed a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-bal=
ance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launc=
hed an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar wi=
th a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices a=
t these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for=
 bankruptcy.=20
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to b=
uy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the=
 company on negative watch.=20
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, =
is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis.=20
"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners th=
at they are creditworthy and continue with business," said Robin West, chai=
rman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. "In a situ=
ation like this, cash is king."=20
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterpa=
rties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more =
collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business.=20
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that.=20
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up wel=
l. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company co=
uld still be severely damaged by the scandal.=20
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its m=
ost recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fasto=
w, the company's former chief financial officer.=20
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure =
by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity inve=
stments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a =
certain level.=20
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which shou=
ld have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed=
.=20
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the sam=
e balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered fr=
om marking their private equity investments to market.=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trade=
r tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leadi=
ng market for low-interest, short-term loans.=20
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors ques=
tioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financi=
al officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York St=
ock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that=
 the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in co=
mmercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks=
 offer.=20
"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassa=
dy, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People ar=
e questioning the credibility of management."=20
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial =
paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 point=
s to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that pric=
e, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%.=20
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut af=
ter $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron ne=
eds good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding=
 collateral and to settle transactions.=20
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said =
Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and ti=
me-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capit=

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to c=

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that =
continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies t=
o consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, wh=

the company and cut back on business with it.=20
"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wro=

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10.=20
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now be=
en stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.=
I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani t=
han waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactl=
y zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (thoug=
h one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). T=
he Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg=
un until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpet=
ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcem=
ent that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New J=
ersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary=
-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E=
.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha=
t Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not every=
thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-=
front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion =
but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular=
ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the=
 right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr=
udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck=
, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe=
edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac=
eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa=
nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous=
e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston=
 energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush =
campaign cash machine.=20
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since =
Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser=
viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,=
 is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c=
ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha=
ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration =
in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in=
 the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous=
ands of their employees.=20
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland =
security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac=
k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri=
dge.=20
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a=
 large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.=
 A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio=
n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job=
s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be=
cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the =
administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w=
ho have brought us where we are today.=20
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those=
 of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber=
 of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As=
hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha=
ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid=
e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen=
 no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat=
riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.=
=20
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi=
bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along=
 with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin=
es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi=
lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o=
f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req=
uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of=
 it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita=
ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a=
ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the=
 Republican Bill Frist.=20
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks=
 of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- =
David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi=
c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe=
e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r=
eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.=
 Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula=
g.=20
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati=
on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic=
h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n=
ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s=
ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve=
r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl=
azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou=
gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army =
of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international=
 and domestic terrorism.''=20
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops=
 offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication=
 of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r=
espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add=
s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple =
of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'=
' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service=
s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the=
re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R=
. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first =
place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom=
eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen=
t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi=
ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa=
s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s=
till more confusion.=20
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka=
w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to=
 shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.=
 That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo=
r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly =
codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca=
n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the =
war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali=
ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their =
intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst=
ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear=
s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because =
the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a=
 C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol=
itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S=
houlders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reass=
uring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares=
 worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunc=
h that has left the company's credibility in ruins.=20
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold=
 about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held =
2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors=
 who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by =
July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron de=
clined to comment on the share sales.=20
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the=
 financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enr=
on's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep =
another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us=
 if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."=20
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission in=
to partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer.=
=20
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to r=
estore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong.=20
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed in=
vestments".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned b=
y Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of r=
eviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday.=20
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buy=
ing the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. f=
irms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial pr=
oject, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank an=
d Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added.=20
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which =
is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 millio=
n investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel.=20
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from =
India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped =
in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility =
MSEB.=20
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and ser=
ved a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.=20
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =
final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That=
 six month period expires on November 19.=20
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced tha=
t it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indi=
an government.=20
TIME RUNNING OUT=20
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would als=
o discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novem=
ber 19.=20
"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as=
 saying.=20
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to =
arbitration, which would not help India.=20
"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a sit=
uation DPC will win hands down," the paper added.=20
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately.=20
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the=
 dispute so far.=20
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity,=
 but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interes=
t.=20
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if th=
e founders agree to sell their stake at a discount.=20
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power=
 and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 perc=
ent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.=20
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less t=
han $1 billion, the paper added.=20
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment=
.=20
($1=3D48.00 Indian rupees).

Enron sues Microsoft for breach of contract ; Move could block high-speed s=

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for br=
oadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest softwa=
re company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions.=20
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing th=
e high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leavin=
g MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- wh=
ere Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director o=
f marketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to o=
ffer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential custo=
mers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is m=
aking a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner.=20
"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and=
 at the same time we are evaluating other providers," Visse said.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing co=
mpany policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest=
 energy trader.=20
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for M=
SN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver o=
perational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing =
and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported.=20
Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering a=
nd billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported.=

Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry=20
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millio=
ns of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told th=
em to get Microsoft's products instead.=20
The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community tha=
t Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Micros=
oft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other bro=
wsers after all.=20
Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lif=
t of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Re=
ichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site.=20
Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and=
 federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accus=
ing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices.=20

MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microso=
ft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony'=
s PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game mark=
et, a Sony spokeswoman said.=20
The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony'=
s San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a D=
igital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokesw=
oman Kirsten Maynard said.=20
In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays a=
nd sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the softwar=
e. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an adva=
nced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15.=20
"A lot has changed with both companies," Maynard said. "It sort of became n=
ot-a-fit anymore."=20
Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Ni=
ntendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't=
 be reached for comment on the shutdown.=20

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) on December 4,
2001, posted for public comment a proposed Wholesale Electric Standards
Model (WESM) -- an industry-based consensus process for developing,
maintaining, and publishing standards that promote reliable and
efficient wholesale electricity markets throughout North America.  Such
standards would address, in an integrated way, the whole spectrum of
reliability, market interface, and business practice standards through a
fair, open, balanced, and inclusive stakeholder process.

On December 19, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
an Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards Development
Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (Docket No.
RM01-12-00).  That order directs the industry to reach agreement on the
formation of an organization to develop consensus standards for business
practices and electronic communications.  If the industry cannot reach
consensus on this issue by March 15, the Commission indicated that it
will either institute its own procedures to choose an organization or
will develop the standards itself.

To provide the NERC Standing Committees Representation Task Force
(SCRTF) as well as the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees
the broadest possible input, the Board strongly urges all interested
parties to comment on the WESM proposal in the context of the recent
FERC order.  Commenters should give particular attention to how NERC and
the recently approved North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)
could collaborate in developing and overseeing a single, industry-based
consensus process to develop standards that assure the continued
reliable operation of the integrated North American electric
transmission grids as well as the development of business practice
standards and communication protocols needed to complement the market
design principles that FERC has announced its intention to develop.

NERC's SCRTF will use all comments received to help shape its final
proposal to the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees in
February 2002.  We also intend to provide the input we receive in this
public forum on the WESM model to FERC for its consideration. 

For additional information on the SCRTF and its membership, go to:
www.nerc.com/committees/scrtf.html. Please direct questions to David
Nevius, NERC Vice President, at 609-452-8060, or e-mail
dave.nevius@nerc.com.

The proposal is posted at the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/. The deadline for comments is January 8, 2002.

Sincerely,

Heather Gibbs

Here is something close to the note I wrote for Cindy in the meeting.  I think we can advocate consistency as an employee advocacy issue.  If we think the HR department can make this happen without a note, great. 

TO: Management Committee

As you know, we have announced broadly that restructuring activities are imminent.  

At this sensitive time, it is fair and right to employees to communicate consistently across the company in a coordinated fashion.  Therefore, please ask your management teams to refrain from speculating about specific reductions or communicating preliminary information to their people.  This creates a situation where there are have's and have not's -- those with information (preliminary at best), and those who are left anxious and wondering why they've heard nothing.

As promised, we will have a coordinated communication -- which will include you -- when plans are finalized.  In the meantime, let's do everything we can to avoid creating additional angst for employees.

Thanks for your leadership in this difficult time.

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the "market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets." He added: "It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets." 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, "I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe." 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months," says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. "We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery." 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. "If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Dietert says. "In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow." 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, "Why? Ask why." 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion." 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have in fact
happened from time to time."

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN
2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking "non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share," in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

 Atlantic Tropical Development Outlook      Issued:   08:30 AM Friday Octob=
er 26, 2001   [IMAGE]   Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean Sea:   The only disturbanc=
e in the tropics that has any chance at all of affecting any land areas is =
a tropical wave in the central Caribbean, south of Jamaica. This wave is cu=
rrently interacting with a fairly strong upper-level low pressure center to=
 its west. The low center is producing considerable upper-level wind shear =
across the wave, preventing any development. However, there are some indica=
tions that this upper-level low may weaken in 2-3 days. If this occurs, the=
n there might be some slight chance for tropical development in the northwe=
stern Caribbean.   Certainly, we need to keep a close eye on any disturbanc=
e in the northwestern Caribbean, even this late in the storm season. Water =
temperatures are quite warm enough for tropical development there. The main=
 inhibiting factor would be fairly strong southwesterly winds aloft across =
the southern Gulf. If anything should develop near the Yucatan peninsula ea=
rly next week, it would almost certainly be a very weak tropical system, wi=
th thunderstorms displaced well to the northeast of any low-level center. W=
e've seen many such systems over the past two seasons. Regardless of whethe=
r or not this tropical wave develops, it does have the potential to bring s=
howers and thunderstorms to southern Florida toward the middle to end of ne=
xt week. We estimate the chances for development to be about 5-10 percent. =
    Tropical Atlantic:   A tropical disturbance in the far eastern Atlantic=
 southwest of the Azores is interacting with an upper-level low pressure ce=

I just saw a note that you'll speak to us -- the Washington office -- later this morning.  Quite independent from that, I actually wrote this email in my head last night as I experienced yet another sleepless early morning ...

You know this intuitively, I suspect, but I just wanted to underscore that the staff here in DC have experienced a rather stressful period.  First was the 11th, when several of us (Linda, John, Pat, Chris, Allison, Jeff Keeler and I) were all up on the Hill -- literally each of us was within a hundred yards of the Capitol building.  Our phones began ringing as wives and colleagues told us to quickly walk as far away from the Hill as we could since there were reports of more planes in the air.

Then yesterday we all piled into the ER for anthrax testing since we've been up on the Hill in the last few days.  A very long shot on that score, since none of us was in the Hart building on Monday, for cause for concern nonetheless.

I look around me and see small but discernible signs of stress.  I know I experience them at home at night.

But I just wanted to pass this on.  We're doing our jobs, but somehow it just happens that we inadvertently stumble into harm's way at precisely those moments -- when we're doing our jobs!

I grew up overseas, son of diplomats.  We we were in a country for only two years, not the usual three or four year tour -- and when we saw strained families and marriages, and increased alcohol consumption and other ways of dealing with stress ... it was simply because we lived in what they call "hardship posts."  The government understood that, and kept a special watch on you on those countries.  

So, from this hardship post ...  hope this isn't out of line, but wanted to pass on my thoughts directly to you.  Maybe tonight I'll get a full night's sleep now.

Best,
Steve

Steve, here is the contact list that you requested.  By NO means is this a complete list, as I was not able to get hold of everyone in our group.  Christie will be back tomorrow and will add/delete/amend accordingly.  Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C, Northwestern, LSU, UT.
 
As an aside, I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and/or communications.  Enron's credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enron's key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they don't already know.
 
Hope this document helps in the interim.
 
Regards,
 
Cindy

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

* Experiences in Restructuring from Latin America

Steve - 

Question has come my way regarding bus - mass transit subsidy for '02.  Employees want to be sure they will not need to set aside pre-tax $, via open enrollment now in place, to cover anything less than 100% bus subsidy.

Currently (and throughout '01) Enron subsidizes bus passes to employees @ 100% of cost.  This will be a $2.5 mill. expense in '02.  

During budget cycle several months ago it was discussed that Enron could cut this expense in half if subsidy was capped at $50/mo. - same as Parking subsidy.

My records show this was not accepted and we plan to continue with 100% subsidy next year.

Just checking if you.  Given temper of average employee today, I assume this is still the right decision.

- Bill

On Friday's call, one thing in particular troubled me that I wanted to mention privately.  You said, I believe, that senior management doesn't see a role for government affairs in the SEC/partnership issue.  I think that's a fundamental error.

I know I haven't been here as long as others, but after five months one things is crystal clear to me: There are people out there who really hate us, commercial competitors, politicians, interest group types, etc.  I fully anticipate they will use recent events as a way to try and do us further harm in the political, regulatory, public perception arenas.  

I would hate for our senior management to think that this will play out in a nice orderly legal proceeding where everything is dealt with in terms of facts and reason and law.  I believe this episode will play out more along the lines of CA, though on a smaller scale, where demagogues use this for their own advantages.  

I believe gov't affairs needs to play an important role sooner rather than later.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

During a news conference held late on 29 October, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that intelligence sources have found "credible" information that the U.S. could be the focus for some sort of terrorist attacks within the week.  Ashcroft said the information received was not specific as to target or date of attack, but was of sufficient credibility  to warrant sharing with the public. He further called on law enforcement agencies, citizens and U.S. interests abroad to be on "highest alert."   
Although no specific targets were mentioned, various federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, FAA, FBI and DOT have been alerted. 
Effective immediately, and until further notice, DOE and NNSA have mandated that all activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks. Changes in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented. 
DOE and NNSA strongly suggest that the energy industry also implement these actions and to be on alert for any suspicious activities.

We will keep you informed of any new information as it is received.

Steve:

I think I need to go to this, but you will need to approve it.

Jeff Gray, of course, would be interested in attending too, but I understand if one exception is all we can handle right now.  Jeff finishes up his rotation on Friday March 1st.

I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.

 Atlantic Tropical Development Outlook      Issued:   08:30 AM Monday October 22, 2001   [IMAGE]   Gulf of Mexico / Caribbean Sea:   A fairly strong upper-level low over western Cuba is responsible for considerable showers and thunderstorms across the southeastern Gulf through Florida today. Although such non-tropical upper-level features can occasionally develop a surface circulation and acquire tropical characteristics, we do not expect this system to develop into a tropical depression or a storm. However, the upper low will still produce very heavy rainfall across the southern Florida peninsula over the next 24-48 hours as it moves slowly northeastward toward the northern Bahamas.    Tropical Atlantic:   There are two weak tropical waves in the Atlantic, but neither wave shows any signs of organization this morning. Upper-level winds are forecast to remain unfavorable for any tropical development here this week.   Chris Hebert

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

Steve:

Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra

Steve and Maureen,

The note below deals with the conference at Stanford Steve is scheduled to participate in. In case it doesn't 'ring a bell', we discussed it briefly at the end of August.  The Conference is part of our 5 year Reasearch relationship with Stanford entitled "Globe".  The conference is set for January 23rd at Stanford.  There will be 2 Keynote speakers and 3 panels: "Global Ethics", "Global Brand" and "Global Growth";  Steve is part of The "Global Ethics" panel--it should be fairly easy and straight forward (as described below).  Steve, if you have changed your mind about participating, please let me know as soon as possible, so I can discuss it with Stanford.  If it works with your schedule, I agree with what Beth says below, and think it would be a very good opportunity for us, especially at this time.  Please let me know.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Subject: GLOBE Conference schedule


Christie,

Hello! I imagine you're quite busy, given all the changes going on at Enron.
I'm dropping you a line for a couple of reasons.  First, and most important,
I wanted to send along some good wishes during what I imagine is a difficult
time.  I hope you - and those around you - are coping well and that your
spirit is as strong and positive as ever.  

Second, I'm attaching the schedule for the January GLOBE conference.  Steve
Kean's panel will take place 11:15-12:30, which should allow him time to fly
in and out easily on the same day.  There's a lot of enthusiasm about his
participation, and I think this is a great time to have someone from Enron
in front of the MBAs.  He will be in good, and very empathetic company, as
Maria Eitel (NIKE) and Mads Ovlisen (Novo Nordisk) have both led their
companies through some difficult times, facing more than their share of
public scrutiny.  We are working with the panel moderator, David Brady, to
outline some specific questions that members of the panel might wish to
consider in preparing their remarks.  Our goal is to have each panelist
share their own company experiences - essentially sharing the ethical
challenges their company has faced as they've expanded globally across
different cultures and legal regimes. How have they balanced the
responsibility to make a profit with that of being a "good corporate
citizen" in places where corporate "citizenship" may mean very different
things?   Again, each speaker will have approximately ten minutes each in
which to relay their experiences, after which, the moderate will ask some
questions and then ultimately open it up for audience questions.  

As I hope is evident, we are quite excited that Steve is taking part in the
conference.  I will plan to send you the topic outline shortly after the
Thanksgiving holiday.  Please let me know if you'd prefer that I send it to
Steve directly; otherwise I will continue to send information through you.

All the best,

By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much=
 worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will=
 likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession=
, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies.=
=20
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 1=
22 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing =
the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Rev=
iews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20
"A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=
uarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =
year," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=
bout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=
rd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated "BB-plus" or lower by=
 S&P and "Ba1" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=
ch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20
"The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession," said S&P Chief Economist Davi=
d Wyss in a statement. "Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=
ely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=
 high."=20
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=
ee-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for do=
wngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=
es to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=
 merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=
es, insurance and travel.=20
"Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=
y up and be pushed over the brink," said David Keisman, managing director a=
t S&P Risk Solutions.=20
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=
's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=
 at a time S&P said the company's "growth prospects for the future are less=
 optimistic."=20
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=
gain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=
ence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two =
weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=
use interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =
more conservatively.=20
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=
 costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=
ss revenues," he said.=20
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=
ade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

USA: U.S. firms say deals with Enron at normal levels.
By Andrew Kelly

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wholesale natural gas and electricit=
y traders said on Monday their deals with troubled Enron Corp. are still ru=
nning at normal levels.=20
But some are keeping a wary eye on the company's finances and credit status=
 after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies.
"We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watch=
ing that on a daily basis," Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy =
marketer Mirant Corp. told Reuters.=20
"At this point, I would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual w=
ith Enron, but we'll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward," sa=
id Fuller.=20
Officials at companies such as Houston natural gas firm El Paso Corp. and C=
olumbus, Ohio, utility holding company American Electric Power Co. Inc. exp=
ressed similar sentiments, saying nothing had changed in their dealings wit=
h the Houston-based energy company, at least for the time being.=20
"We continue to trade with them," said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charl=
otte-based utility Duke Energy Corp.. "They've always been meticulous in th=
eir credit management and we continue to see that with them," she added.=20
Enron's shares fell to yet another new low on Monday as the company said it=
 was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency Moody's Investo=
r Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt to two notches abo=
ve junk-bond status.=20
Since Oct. 12 Enron's stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company re=
ported its first quarterly loss in over four years, wrote down shareholders=
' equity by $1.2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors' jitters abo=
ut a series of complex off-balance-sheet financial deals.=20
CONFIDENCE CRUMBLES=20
Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble, it could res=
trict the company's access to credit and thus create problems for its core =
energy trading operations.=20
European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there =
was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with En=
ron because of credit worries.=20
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe=
 as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit =
arrangements, the sources said.=20
"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit," said the head of r=
isk management at one U.K. utility that halted its trade with Enron last we=
ek. "The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very res=
trictive basis."=20
Traders in the U.S. wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were =
continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable tr=
ading partner.=20
"I don't have any problems dealing with Enron, especially since I'm doing d=
ay-ahead trades. But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal =
with them," one natural gas trader in the U.S. Southeast told Reuters.=20
A trader who specializes in longer-term deals in the forwards market for el=
ectricity said publicity about Enron's woes had not yet led to any loss of =
market liquidity.=20
"Obviously there's a concern, but the financial situation is not a factor n=
ow," the trader said.=20
Despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speakin=
g, Enron's major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the s=
ituation closely.=20
"Any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deterio=
rating, then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried,=
" said Mirant's Fuller.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Uncertainty about Enron Corp. (ENE) continues to dog=
 investors concerned about the future of the Houston-based energy services =
company.=20
"It's such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarificat=
ion of the company's circumstances," said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, =
Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. Until this occurs, the outlook =
for the company's bonds is choppy, he added.
Enron drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash=
 reserves and calm jittery markets, buying back its outstanding commercial =
paper. And, it's currently negotiating with its bank group for an additiona=
l $1 billion to $2 billion in new credit, according to a report in Monday's=
 Wall Street Journal.=20
Enron's troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $618 m=
illion third-quarter loss and the disclosure of a $1.2 billion erosion of i=
nvestor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief fina=
ncial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
"The company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead o=
f the game on disclosure," said Mitch Stapley, portfolio manager and chief =
fixed income officer, Fifth Third Investment Advisors, Grand Rapids, Mich. =
It becomes harder to regain investors' trust, he said.=20
Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term =
debt rating Monday to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by St=
andard & Poor's Corp., with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a trip=
le-B-plus rating and it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last =
week.=20
Both Fitch and Moody's cited negative investor reaction to recent company d=
evelopments. And Moody's added that its "analysis of the developing situati=
on will focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity suppor=
t and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major count=
erparties."=20
One money manager said he was concerned "about the fallout and its impact o=
n the company's ability to trade" energy.=20
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. T=
he bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar pric=
e of 80 on Friday. Many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is=
 a demarcation separating high-yield debt from distressed debt levels.=20
The company's bonds improved a little on Monday, to about an 83 dollar pric=
e.=20
"I'm seeing offerings but no bids," said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivki=
n & Co., Princeton, N.J. There is a reluctance on the part of potential buy=
ers because of the threat of future downgrades, he said.=20
The cool reception that Enron's bonds are receiving is "another example of =

Enron's stock continues slide on credit woes

10/29/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock slid to new lows on Monday, pushed down =
in part by Moody's Investors Service announcing a possible downgrade of the=
 company's credit rating pending a review.=20
The downgrade came as Enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit l=
ines as the largest U.S. natural gas and power marketing company struggles =
to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over=
 losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company's former chief fi=
nancial officer.
In trading Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares we=
re down nearly 9 percent, or dlrs 1.38 a share, at dlrs 14.02 - their lowes=
t level in nearly seven years. A year ago, Enron stock sold at nearly dlrs =
85 a share.=20
Enron's efforts to acquire more credit came after the Houston-based company=
 last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it h=
as with various banks to shore up investor confidence.=20
"We are in discussions about new credit lines," Enron spokeswoman Karen Den=
ne said Monday. "We're taking action to restore investor and market confide=
nce."=20
Denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking. But The W=
all Street Journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is betwe=
en dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being co=
mpleted.=20
Denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit Enron cashed in last week, dlrs =
2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt. Currently, there are no pl=
ans for the other dlrs 1 billion, she said.=20
Moody's on Monday placed all of Enron's long term debt obligations on revie=
w for downgrade, citing "substantially reduced valuations in several of its=
 businesses."=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quar=
ter, taking a one-time charge of dlrs 1.01 billion attributed to investment=
 losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings.=20
Enron's stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of=
 those losses were tied to partnerships managed by Enron's former chief fin=
ancial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
Concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Enron ousted Fastow last week.=20
Moody's said in a press release the "magnitude of the announced charges wil=

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)
2001-10-29 16:46 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

     (Adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declined
a ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.

     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt
ratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and also
placed the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.

     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cash
needed to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,
Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper
last week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.

     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron
bonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment
Management Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house
in order.''

     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.

                             Shut Out

     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the
commercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months
or less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,
sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more.

     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,
continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported
$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading.

     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a
seven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50
billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a
market capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value
was $10.5 billion.

                           Deterioration

     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its
bonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid.

     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.
Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that
downgrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''
according to Moody's.

     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne
Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for
them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''

     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-
rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,
who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he
helps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,
almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,
according to Bloomberg data.

                            Cash Needed

     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,
eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved
back into the position.

    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships
were disclosed.

    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.
It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean
Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives
Enron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''

     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's
rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
``We are still investment grade.''



Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to
$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.



Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says
2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interested
in buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge in
the last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Risk
reported, citing unnamed sources.

     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion from
a high of more than $55 billion, companies such as Royal
Dutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' the
newsletter reported.

     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,
Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, and
has sought to purchase the company for three years, the newsletter
said, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst in
New York.

     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn't
comment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately return
calls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.



Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's comments
in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy
trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from
private partnerships.

     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paper
rating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow the
short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in the
future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in
commercial paper last week.

     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds
Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps
manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as
4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody's
downgrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value a
week ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before
that downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as
$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.

     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings
of Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' The
ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed
the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for
downgrade.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.

     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial loss
in investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.

                            Cash Needed

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from
investments outside its business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed.

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships were
disclosed.

     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.
     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last
week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed
the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of
Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
`` We are still investment grade.''



Insiders at Electric Utilities Showing Their Faith=20

Name an industry where one of its best-known players went public in 1996, s=
aw its stock rise more than 1,800% in the following five years, but now fin=
ds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment?=20
Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the ind=
ustry is electric utilities.=20
Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides=
 as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NY=
SE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Ene=
rgy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20
These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of=
 them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significa=
nt insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there =
is a positive industry trend to profit from.=20
Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have=
 proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their =
volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not re=
gulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IP=
Ps) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs=
.=20
In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was=
 to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography=
 of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial cultu=
re at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when c=
hasing after business opportunities.=20
The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They al=
l had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and =
many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' sha=
res. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings.=20
At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in=
 late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the p=
ast few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five =
insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average=
 of 53%.=20
This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me =
researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I se=
e.=20
"There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy," rema=
rks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP st=
ocks are weak now. "But while supply may be fine right now, you also have t=
o look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportun=
ity to replace infrastructure."=20
Out With the Old, In With the New
The fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened ba=
ckbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from =
replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy=
 in the U.S. and abroad.=20
With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facil=
ities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rat=
her choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are ava=
ilable.=20
Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to po=
wer present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now ar=
e a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more effic=
ient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of thes=
e new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity n=
eeds, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business.=
=20
But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% mor=
e energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new na=
tural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than t=
heir predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power i=
s needed. Can you say lower transmission costs?=20
So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a gen=
erator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmissi=
on infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line=
.=20
As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continu=
e to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same=
 time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increa=
ses in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity =
from reaching stratospheric levels.=20
Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, ana=
lysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts =
following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy.=20
This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES=
, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mi=
rant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are tr=
ading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations.=20
Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned st=
ill look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-=
term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now.=20
Postscript
Readers will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commen=
tary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foresee=
ing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance she=
et investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive in=
sider signal like its peers.=20
Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the s=
tock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purc=
hase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP sto=
cks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11.=20
If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to=
 believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellen=

A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market

Sometimes one stock can completely transfix the market in a negative way.=
=20
Right now that one stock is Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . It trans=
fixes us because it acknowledges a simple truth: We are just dealing with p=
ieces of paper here, pieces of paper backed up by nothing but the honesty a=
nd culture of the people who work at the company.=20
When you put it that way, you realize how fragile this game can be. We have=
 to believe that the system of checks and balances we have -- outside accou=
ntants, lawyers and the SEC -- can put enough pressure, honest pressure, on=
 execs to keep them from doing the wrong thing.=20
When they don't we have no clue of what we are buying.=20
I keep thinking back to Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which colla=
psed three years ago when it turns out that one of the companies that made =
up Cendant was a bogus company: CU International. Who knew what the company=
 was really worth if CU was a fraud? Who knew what the multiple might be? W=
ho knew what the company was worth? Who knew how to value it?=20
When you don't know, you don't average down. You sell. You ask questions la=
ter.=20
That's what is going on with Enron right now, and it is freaking out everyb=
ody as Enron, while not a keystone of this market, was a core holding of ou=
tfits like Janus, Putnam, Citigroup, State Street and Fidelity.=20
Anytime you get a stock that is widely held that loses billions in market c=
apitalization overnight, whether it be Lucent (LU:NYSE - news - commentary)=
 or Nortel (NT:NYSE - news - commentary) or Enron, you scare portfolio mana=
gers. When the selloff is exacerbated by fears of chicanery, it gets even w=
orse. Enron's turning into the story that threatens to be a crossover, one =
that is doing more than just pulling down utilities. The market is about co=
nfidence. We have to have confidence that paper assets are backed up by som=
ething, even if it is the prestige and honor of executives. When that confi=
dence is undermined in one major stock, it gets undermined in all.=20
That's where we are right now.=20

Moody's downgrades Enron's debt
Enron asking banks for more credit=20
Lisa Sanders
CBSMarketWatch.com
10/29/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Shares of Enron fell further Monday after Moody's Inves=
tors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt a notch.
Enron, which hit a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29, was well on its way t=
o another year low Monday. Heading for a ninth straight day of losses, Enro=
n shed more than 9 percent, or $1.41, to $13.99. The stock was again the mo=
st active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million share=
s had changed hands.
Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, =
and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The a=
ction follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter an=
d was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deteri=
oration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice presid=
ent at Moody's.=20
"However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pa=
y off their commercial paper was a smart business move," said Stephen Moore=
, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Pri=
me-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.
Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide=
 more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to=
 pay down commercial paper.
The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goa=
ls.
"It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables=
 them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now," Moore said.=
 "They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital=
 to support their wholesale trading business."=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in=
 discussions with banks for further financing. Additional credit would help=
 boost Enron's liquidity position.
The lingering concern for Moody's is that there "yet may be something else =
out there that gets to the credibility issue of Enron itself," Moore said.=
=20
At the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships -- LMJ a=
nd LMJ2 - created in 1999 by former CFO Andy Fastow and since dissolved. En=
ron ousted Fastow last week. See related story. </news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B=
FCA73BA9%2D55D0%2D4EE8%2DB6E7%2DBD924898CA4B%7D&siteid=3Dmktw> "The market =
was unaware," of the existence of the partnerships, Moore said.
"Quite frankly, we don't think there is anything else," he said. "But Enron=
 is huge, and if this could happen...there is a lingering concern that some=
thing else might happen. We cannot confirm or deny that this is true. We wi=
ll be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these."
Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week.
"Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein becom=
e impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wh=
olesale business, the Enron engine," he said.=20
Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts --=
 Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion. M=
arlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both do=
wn a notch.
The potential issue for the trusts may be "how much equity Enron would have=
 to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay of=
f the debt." Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of asse=
ts to meet its obligation.

Enron Goes Begging=20
Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET=20

NEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for addit=
ional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year=
 low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold.=
 Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit =
line, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday.=20

Enron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business p=
artners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss =
in more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in ch=
arges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Se=
curities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships =
run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow w=
as forced to step down from the company last week.=20

The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved=
 by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.


In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001
By BILL WHITE=20
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=
ow take the time to say "thanks" when the company has experienced some high=
ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=
ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=
ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=
ing a big difference in their community.=20
Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=
 multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=
ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=
atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=
et of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry le=
aders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Fi=
nancial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricit=
y.=20
This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age=
 of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosio=
n in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revita=
lize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a larg=
e Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth,=
 an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office sp=
ace.=20
Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on=
 Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volu=
nteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort=
, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the p=
rivate funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it wou=
ld be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league basebal=
l and status as a big league town.=20
Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees base=
d on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large division=
s and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their =
talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal c=
orporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a com=
pany that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far =
and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them.=20
Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =
who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a fam=
ily farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degre=
e at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began =
a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired t=
he smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by inst=
alling Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the =
week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks=
 that they could count on "best young executive in the business, Ken Lay," =
to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of =
Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist w=
hen Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm.=
 This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness t=
hat attracted top talent to his team.=20
Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula=
 wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives thro=
ughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. En=
ron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms a=
re secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of o=
ther successes.=20
Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had m=
any American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international =
market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also wel=
comed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on=
 industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies fea=
red the impact of pollution control on their bottom line.=20
Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expe=
ctations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based=
 on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a c=
onvenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron sup=
plied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's ups=
tart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perc=
eption that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog.=20
And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=
ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =
a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=
o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=
ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.=
=20
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=
o many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=
nd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=
ss thanks and steady support.=20

Steve--touching back to a conversation we had two weeks ago, I have set an appointment to meet with Norm Coleman here in Minnesota to go over energy issues and Enron interests.  As a Mayor he has been heavily supported by Xcel (old NSP).  My sense is that he is going to line up along the lines of the Bush administration energy plan.  I'll send an e mail out to all on this list once I have met with him to keep everyone in the loop.
 
Sue Walden may already have contacted you about the timing on an event hosted by Mr. Lay for Norm in Houston.  The Coleman folks originally had wanted something this month, but it looks like a January or February date is going to work better.

As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made.  With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.

Poor Performing Programs
The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.  Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.  In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.

Workload Distribution
The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system "bottlenecks".  We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.  Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. 

Improved Close Monitoring
The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.  

Communication Strategy Implement
The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.  This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance.

 Atlanta Airport Evacuated Because of Breach
ATLANTA (AP) - Authorities halted departing flights at Atlanta's airport and evacuated people from the concourses Friday after a man ran through a security checkpoint and jumped on a terminal train.
The Federal Aviation Administration stopped all departures at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and planes in other cities going to Atlanta were told to remain on the ground, FAA spokesman Christopher White said.
All the passengers and employees in the concourses were cleared and sent to the main baggage pickup area.
Some planes were allowed to land, but none could take off, White said.
Airport police were pursuing the man. "It's still unfolding," Delta spokesman Peggy Estes said.It was unclear when air traffic would restart at the airport.
At this point airlines are diverting their flights according to location of nearest city.

Steve, please have your admin make 8 1/2 x 11 copies
of the various sections of your benefits statement

scenarios.

Thanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional

offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas?

Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport Update
November 16, 2001  (2:45pm)
Three hours after up to 10,000 travelers were evacuated from Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, police officials reopened concourses at the world's busiest airport. Officers blew whistles and issued orders on bullhorns about 2:45 p.m. for employees to first return to the terminals.  The thousands of people who had flooded the street outside the airport were asked to make room first for wheelchair passengers to enter the airport.  Police indicated that employees would be allowed back into the terminals.  Police also said people in wheelchairs, and the elderly would be allowed back into the concourse first. The doors then opened for other passengers, who were forced to go back through the long screening process in order to reach their terminals. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation ordered the evacuation of between 5,000 to 10,000 people at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport Friday after a man rushed past a security checkpoint.

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS
Economics & Technology Summit
  January 28 - 29, 2002 w Renaissance Houston w Houston, TX
 
www.srinstitute.com/CR210 <http://www.srinstitute.com/CR210>
 
Make the Right Investments in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Industry by Learning the Latest Developments in:
    
??wTerminals      wTechnology            wRegulations      wTransportation
??wEconomics     wDistribution Plans   wTrends             wProduction Facilities  
 
    Within the next decade, LNG will become one of the most reliable energy sources for
    the United States. The opportunities for LNG continue to grow, as illustrated by 
    recent plans to extract 12 Tcf of natural gas from Alaska as early as 2002. As a 
    result of similar discoveries in Australia and other neighboring countries there has 
    been an increase in proposed receiving terminals in the United States. You will hear 
    first hand from current and future terminal owners along with why there is a rush to 
    build LNG carriers. 
 
    Due to the drop in natural gas prices and the United States economic downturn, it is 
    important for you to understand the latest economic issues facing both the LNG 
    and natural gas industries.

As you know, the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry into related party transactions Enron did with LJM.  We are cooperating fully and are providing the information the SEC has requested.  However, we have learned today that the SEC is extremely sensitive about us using their inquiry as a "shield" to not answer certain questions -- i.e. "I can't answer that because of a pending SEC inquiry."  As a result, we have been advised that we should not make any comment about the SEC inquiry in any context.  This extends beyond media and includes any interactions with customers, regulators, etc.  Please forward this message on to anyone in your group who this might impact.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.  Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under).  The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).

The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).  I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.

Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.  The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.  When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.  There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.

Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.

Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.

     Hi, Steve - 
     
     I've been thinking of you quite a bit over the past few months as the 
     Enron woes have unfolded and finally decided to drop you a line.  I 
     hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective.  One of the 
     things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the 
     fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of 
     your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn.  Maybe it comes from 
     having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my 
     conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate 
     your loyalty to your staff.
     
     Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me.  We're getting 
     ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs.  
     Fortunately, we're in Bryn Mawr, where we have a college town, rather 
     than suburban, environment.  In fact, we are within three miles of 
     four four-year colleges!  I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS 
     meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man.  
     
     Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of 
     working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people).  
     However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence 
     into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom 
     line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again.  
     Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm 
     thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years 
     and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years.
     
     Do let me know if you get to the East Coast.  We'd love to take you to 
     dinner.
     
     Take care, and hang in there!
     
     Carolyn

TXU Sells Two Texas Power
Plants to Exelon; Sale Supports
Strategies of Both Companies=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PRNewswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) and Exelon Generation ann=
ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gas-fired electric generating pla=
nts to Exelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) for $433=
 million. The transaction, involving two Dallas/Fort Worth plants with a co=
mbined capacity of 2,334 MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres=
ence in the Texas region, enhancing its geographic and market diversity, wh=
ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas.=20

Analysis: Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st=
rategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest gener=
ation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home=
 state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they =
are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a =
presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into cou=
ntries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceed=
s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni=
ted States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex=
as market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a partic=
ularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.

Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is =
selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is abo=
ut 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Stati=
on, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 bar=
rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. =
Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into=
 operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963,=
 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek St=
eam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in D=
allas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units wer=
e added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating un=
its of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo=
r them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas p=
ipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).

The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr=
etty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the com=
pany's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this p=
oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale =
apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke=
ts outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to st=
rengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become in=
creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s=
pace since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note t=
hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate=
 in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to =
Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating uni=
ts, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture =
is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w=
ill support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential m=
arket power that the company may have in Texas.=20

The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l=
atter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene=
rgy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to cha=
rge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to=
 hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allow=
s a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within t=
he Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is=
 within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentrati=
on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar=
kets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capa=
city, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming c=
lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.

>From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capaci=
ty by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exe=
lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest=
 asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger b=
etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong =
nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the =
nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, =
owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon=
 may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelo=
n Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, ov=
ersees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydr=
o generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pen=
nsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating cap=
acity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e=
ffort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, fr=
om the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast.=20

Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas=
 market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind Californ=
ia), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is n=
o longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will =
prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state =
next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Te=
xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-th=
e company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy mar=
ket represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmiss=
ion network.=20

One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as=
sets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. =
Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which =
up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago=
 to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into=
 the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-=
MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior =
to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from =
two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 M=
W from the Wolf Hollow plant).

It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma=
rket, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are =
fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Unde=
r the sales agreement, Exelon Power, Exelon Generation's power plant operat=
ion arm, will assume operation of the plants. The transaction includes a to=
lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe=
r during summer months for the next five years at market-based rates. Consi=
dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement, it is presumed that =
TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the =
summer months of the five-year contract, and then purchasing the electric o=
utput of the plants during that time. Interestingly, TXU is able to abide b=
y Texas' requirement that it not own and control more than 20 percent withi=
n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants. However, realisti=
cally, TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants,=
 at least in the summer months during its five-year contract with Exelon. T=
his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be=
tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas' deregulation pl=
an.=20

SK - we will forward the necessary information to him (the claim form).  It's just not the same here without you.  Happy New Years.  Mo


Steve,
Happy holidays.  It is hard to know where to begin except to say that we
certainly have followed the Enron story closely.  Not for the obvious
business reasons, of course, but because people, like you, that we came to
know and like were going through such difficulty.  Naturally, we all hope
that as 2002 arrives with it will come easier and better times and that
ultimately this all plays out in a way that is good for you.

You know that we very much enjoyed working with Enron and spared no effort
to do the best job we could.  For this reason, we were delighted when we
received, prior to the announcement of Enron's bankruptcy a check for the
final payment of our truncated agreement.  However, that check has now
bounced twice.  We are a small company and while the payment was not
immense, only $120K, it is still meaningful.  

Do you have any advice for us as to how we can get this check honored?
Clearly, it was the intent to pay us and we are now caught in the system.
Among the many things you must have to do, I know this is small.  But to us
it is large and if there is a way that you can help we would be most
grateful.

Many thanks and best wishes for the New Year,
David

Hi Mark and Beth 

Attached are the following: 

1. Draft comments re: the 401K plan -- NOTE: they have not been approved by legal; 
2. A Dow Jones story alleging that the recent lawsuit could allow: i) Dynegy to back away from the deal; ii) creates the implication that the suit adds financial pressure; iii) it also erroneously (I believe) discusses the time frame of the lock down period

WE SHOULD: Consider a well orchestrated leak regarding the fact that these suits are bogus -- the leak would include information on:

?       Enron had been contemplating a change in plan administrators since 1997.  Plans were stalled due to a moratorium on administrator changes as a condition of the PGE acquisition.

?       Enron requested proposals from alternate plan administrators in February of 2001 -- in writing. 
?       In May of 2001, the new administrator (Hewitt) was notified - in writing - of our intent to start our business relationship beginning in October of 2001.   

?       The transition period (when employees could not sell stock), ran from only October 26th to November 13th - a shorter time span than was originally planned.

?       During the transition period Enron's stock went from $15.40 to $9.98 - while we're not happy about the reduced share price, the magnitude of the decline during the lock down period is much smaller than the drop alleged by some plaintiffs attorneys.

?       401K participants have the option to choose between [17] different stocks, including Enron.
