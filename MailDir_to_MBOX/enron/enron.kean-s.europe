Peter

A couple of things you might be able to use for Steve. Unfortunately, no time 
to convert to slides, but
this should provide enough raw material for you.

Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

GERMANY: European power trading set to grow further - Enron.

10/25/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

FRANKFURT, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The volume of electricity trades will continue 
to expand in continental Europe, a senior Enron executive said on Wednesday. 
"Portfolio shifts as well as high oil and dollar prices will continue to 
boost the number of transactions," Gregor Baeumerich, Enron's head of 
continental European power trading, told an IIR conference on energy trade. 
"There are no natural limits to market growth."
According to Enron estimates, German, Austrian and Swiss power trades in 2000 
will amount to a combined 1,500 terawatt hours (TWh) - versus actual 
consumption of 975 TWh - of which Enron will account for around 375 TWh. 
Although the underlying physical demand was not growing, the process of 
market liberalisation had already caused a dramatic acceleration in trading 
activities, said Baeumerich. 
Enron's continental European turnover of 136,7 TWh in the third quarter of 
2000 represented a 10-fold increase over the corresponding 1999 quarter. 
The number of market participants - counting traders, exchanges and new 
trading floors at established energy companies such as municipal utilities - 
in that period had risen to 180 from 100 a year ago, according to Enron 
estimates. 
In future, the number of new entrants would offset those participants lost 
due to the simultaneous concentration process, Enron believed. 
Trade in transmission contracts for a variety of time periods were now 
established both over the counter and at electricity exchanges in Germany, 
the biggest market in its own right, Baeumerich said. 
Next year should also see the emergence of power options. 
But on Enron's wish list for improved German trading conditions were clear 
rules on how to handle bottlenecks at border entrance points, he added. 
Enron also wanted export and import fees to be waived and traders allowed to 
apply for transmission schedules from grid operators after the currently 
observed 1430 local time deadline. 
Instead, Enron favours short-term trading with a one hour lead time - for 
example in response to sudden weather changes which impact on electricity 
needs. 
Baeumerich also reported that usage of Enron's online trading platform for 
power, gas, and coal, introduced a year ago, already accounted for 60 percent 
of total worldwide turnover. In Europe, the figure was 50 percent.

John sherriff and I hosted Ian Murray for an hour today at his request.  He 
will be arriving in Houston in January, having just completed a tour of duty 
in Sao Paolo, where he came into contact with Jim Bannantine.  At the end of 
the meeting I gave him your name/number as a contact.  He may call you.  No 
big issues, he just wants to make sure he knows us, and we know him, as we 
are a major inward investor in the UK.   thanks  mcs

Brussels, 2 Octobre 2000
Commission opens in-depth investigation into the joint control of EnBW by
EDF and OEW
The European Commission has decided to undertake a full, second phase
investigation of the proposed transaction by which Electricit, de France
(EdF) and Zweckverband Oberschw,bische Elektrizit,tswerke (OEW), Germany,
acquire joint control over Energie Baden-W_rttemberg (EnBW). The Commission
considers that the proposed joint-venture raises serious doubts, as it woul=
d
remove a potential competitor to EdF on the French electricity market.

EDF is a wholly state-owned company whose principal activities are
generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity in France=
.
It is the operator of the national transport grid. EDF has shareholdings in
electricity companies in many European countries Austria, Belgium, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Unite=
d
Kingdom. Outside of France, EDF is also active in electricity trading
through EDF Trading Ltd., which is jointly controlled by EDF and S.A.
Louis-Dreyfus & Cie. Furthermore, EDF is active in the construction,
operation, and maintenance of electrical plants and power networks and
provides waste recycling and street lightening services.
OEW is an association of nine public districts in the Southwest of Germany.
Its main purpose is to hold shares in companies active in the energy
sectors.
EnBW is a vertically integrated electricity utility active in electricity
generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity mainly in
the Southwest of Germany. Furthermore, EnBW has activities in electricity
trading. Other business activities comprise the supply of gas and district
heating, telecommunication, waste recycling and financial services.
On the basis of the information available to date, the merger's primary
effects will be felt on the French market. EdF is by far the largest
electricity generator in France. The company has a monopoly in supplying
final customers with electricity. According to the French electricity laws,
which took effect in the year 2000 as a result of the implementation of the
Electricity Directive aiming to liberalise the European electricity markets=
,
industrial customers with consumption in excess of 16 GWh/year (per site)
have the choice of their electricity supplier. EnBW, which has its supply
area along the French-German border, can be considered as potential entrant
into the French electricity market approaching eligible customers. The
Commission accordingly has serious doubts about the operation's
compatibility with the common market, in as much as the transaction could
lead to the elimination of a potential competitor entering the French
market. The Commission's enquiries also gave grounds for concern on further
closure effects of the French market that could be exercised by
commonly-held participations of EdF and EnBW in Swiss electricity operators
which could enter the French market.

The Commission has accordingly decided to undertake a full investigation of
the case. It has a further four months from the date of that decision in
which to make a final decision.

Kommission er"ffnet  eingehende Untersuchung betreffend die Kontrolle von
EnBW durch EdF und OEW
Die Europ,ische Kommission hat beschlossen, die vertiefte Untersuchung der

beabsichtigen. F_r die Kommission wirft dieses Vorhaben erhebliche Bedenken
auf, da hiermit ein potenzieller Wettbewerber auf dem franz"sischen
Strommarkt wegfallen w_rde.
EdF ist eine vollst,ndig vom franz"sischen Staat gehaltene Gesellschaft,

Die Kommission hat deshalb ernsthafte Zweifel an der Vereinbarkeit dieses

Just a short note.  Below, Philip Davies reports on his conversation with the 
head of energy balancing at the Polish grid company.  While this is only one 
person's view, it should be an informed view.  And that view is that a 
balancing market, which should lead to trading, should be in place for 1 
January 2001.  Even discounting for optimism, 1 April does not seem 
unrealistic.  There are still hard issues to be resolved regarding long-term 
PPAs and stranded costs, but given this informed, and bullish, view on when 
we might have a "market" in Poland, I wanted to provide you with this status 
report.   We can now see light at the end of the tunnel.  mcs

Subject: Meeting with Rakowski, PSE

Jarek D., Tomasz and myself met yesterday with Jan Rakowski, PSE Director of 
"System Market Management" (ie, introduction of the balancing and settlement 
rules) and member of the Gielda Supervisory Board.  Highlights:

PSE is ready to begin negotiations on a transmission agreement with Enron.  
We were told to take up the issue with Mr Janiczek - director of Transmission 
Dept.  Rakowski was a bit vague on the nature of the contract (eg, OH or OHT) 
and timing but let's see how far and how quickly we progress with Janiczek.  
(Following the entry into force of the interconnection ordinance on 27 
October, we do have a right to such an agreement under conditions set out in 
the ordinance).
Rakowski asked us to send an application to be included in PSE's balancing 
market rollout programme.  They will give us a specific code number and 
include us in test programmes and balancing market implementation 
developments.
Rakowski characterised the Polish market as reaching "the point of no return" 
as of 1 January.  Certain key changes are introduced as of this date, notably:
 (i) distribution companies will become by definition "active" or "passive" 
participants in the balancing market.  Active will be those that have signed 
up to the new balancing market rules.  Passive  will be those that have not, 
who by default will be charged for their entire consumption at imbalance 
settlement prices (PSE will not recognise contracts notified by distribution 
companies that have  not signed up to the new rules; a few distcos anyway buy 
100% from PSE eg, Slupsk, Czestochowa).
 (ii) he is saying that hourly balancing & settlement will be introduced (in 
terms of the necessary IT being put in place), although at the same time 
hourly data will be for information only at the start.   Settlement will 
remain monthly for some transitional period but not past 1 July.
While he claims he recognises the limitations placed on traders (and the 
market's development) by the ("temporary") "balanced position" requirement on 
OHs, he offered no real justification besides PSE's desire to "control".
General tone was positive, he expressed happiness to meet with supporters of 
competition (in contrast to distco resistance).  But his underlying tone 
implied -as we knew- that PSE intends the transition to move at a pace deemed 
reasonable by PSE, rather than being driven by participants insisting on 
their legal rights or by PSE delivering on its obligations in a timely 
manner.  Thus the need to stay on the case of him and his team as of now.  

Justyna, Tomasz - let's see if we can find more precise details of the 
changes to be introduced on 1 January, try

As you all know, third-party access in gas and power in Germany is on a 
negotiated basis.  You do not need to read below, but the highlight is that 
the trade association, VIK, representing industrial users of energy, has 
walked away from the negotiations of a third-party access regime in the gas 
industry in Germany.  This is a real political blow for the German Economics 
Ministry, which has been very resistant to regulated third-party access, in 
the belief that negotiations were the way to proceed.  Just a brief update 
for all of you.   mcs

Subject: After yesterdays failure to make any progress: VIK steps out of 
Gas-VVII negotiations on improved grid access conditions

Yesterday was the last "negotiation" round before the scheduled meeting with 
the minister of economics on Monday
Again no suprises yesterday: The gas incumbents did not move an inch on the 
three current issues:
-access to storage
-management of capacity constraints
-transparency

Somewhat as a suprise came the attached letter plus press statement today 
from VIK stating that they are not willing to spend any more time without a 
significant change on the gas side. This decision was supposingly driven by 
board members of VIK today.

>From our prospective it is good news that VIK (finally) takes a stand to get 
some REAL improvement in the access conditions.
Details psl see attached (german) press statement:



Happy to answer any questions

Carsten

Subject: Spanish Govt. authorises the merger, but...

We do not know the particulars of the following press headlines (the decree=
=20
will be published on Monday). Comments below s/t the actual drafting of the=
=20
decree:

Generation

Market share of 42% of generation: We do not know if this is expressed (in =
MW=20
or MWh, etc...). Still unknown if this includes special regime generation; =
if=20
yes, the market share of ordinary regime generation may go down to 35% (we=
=20
insisted on 30%).

Divestiture by auction, as we proposed.

This share could not be increased until 2005, but no aparent limitation on=
=20
new built generation for the merged.

Particulars about the mix are still ambigous.

Transmission

Reduction on the participation on OMEL and REE to 10%

Distribution

Market share of 48% of distribution: As above, we do not know yet how this =
is=20
expressed, but Vicent was suggesting last Tuesday that a "meaningful"=20
criteria was going to be applied, as opposed to the "meaningless and biased=
"=20
suggested by the utilities and the CNE. We recommended 40% as compared to 6=
6%=20
proposed by the utilities.

Commercialisation

Market share of 40% of new + renew contracts on the whole Spanish territory=
.=20
On the top of this, the merged company's market share cannot go beyond 60% =
of=20
new + renewed contracts on its own distribution area. Although our proposal=
=20
of applying these same limits to existing and new contracts has not gone=20
through (there were actually legal problems involved on that), we could cla=
im=20
a great deal of "responsibility" on implementing the second boundary relati=
ve=20
to their own distribution area. (We actually had to convinced Sempra and=20
Aquila to support this initiative).

Although we do not know yet how the % is expressed (as above), it is very=
=20
important the second limitation on their own distribution territory, in ord=
er=20
to spur retail competition and tackle distcos' discriminatory behaviour on=
=20
access and metering issues. Recall that by 2003 all customers are eligible,=
=20
and this limitation will last until 2005.=20

CTCs

CTCs rights are passed to new owners, but the capital gains associated to=
=20
divestiture to offset CTCs rights of the seller. We battled for this last=
=20
piece, but not for the transferral of CTC rights to new owners. We will nee=
d=20
to analysed this more carefully in the decree itself.

No more securitisation! The 4.5% of the tariff, which was devoted to fund=
=20
CTCs has been eliminated. Therefore, we come back to the early days=20
mechanism. Implications:=20
  1) the CTC mechanism will be more transparent now, but still opaque=20
overall;=20
  2) Will the 1998 CTC write-off be re-established, that is, will CTCs=20
increase? More details on Monday

Penalties

=14 ?12,020 per day where the conditions above are not satisfied.

Mark, 
Steven,

please find enclosed some information about our German Gas Origination activities. Next to all the regulatory and market structure challenges we talked about, we have been very successful to get the first deals, earn some money and being a pain for the German incumbents (see attached power point slides).

As requested I also attached the faxes (EnronGasMarketFax and EnronEnergyFax) we send out on a biweekly basis to more than 700 market counterparts to create price transparency. Enron was the first and still is the only one who offers these data to the whole German market.

Again thank you for your time last week in Houston, it was very useful to get your insights for our further development.

Subject: Proposed EnWG holds threat for cross border trade

We have received an advance copy of the proposed EnWG (energy law). The 
proposed changes
to the EnWG  has been agreed upon within the German Economics Ministry and is 
a direct response to Brussel's
infringment proceedings against the German government. 

The proposed law has many flaws. The chief one is a so-called "Schutzklausel" 
which will empower the German
Economics Ministry to prohibit imports of electricity and gas into Germany 
from other EU member states if the 
the originating market is not as open as Germany's is. It will also allow the 
Ministry to prohibit imports
of power and gas imports from non-EU states. The latter is of course aimed at 
the so-called
"dirty power"imports from central and eastern Europe. 

The timeline is roughly as follows:

1. Consultation with the Verbaende and the Ministry on Nov 13
2. Consultation with the Laender about a week later.
3. Kabinet-verison ready by December 20th
4. Possible passage of the law by the Bundestag in March of 2001.

We are doing the following:

1. Providing as EFET a critique of the proposed law - with special focus on 
the Schutzklausel.
2. Lobbying the EU not to withdraw their infringment proceeding against the 
German government until
certain changes are made in the proposed law.
3. Attending the Ministry consultations to raise our grave concerns.
4. Explore a legal challenge to the Schutzklausel - which even the Economics 
Minsitry agrees is legally
problematic.
5. Possible PR actions aimed at "naming and shaming"

Thanks, Paul

Steve,

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

Several recent developments, and in the interest of economy (mine!), I am 
copying all of you, who will have varying interests in this.

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, 
October, and by 2002, October for gas.  Sadia, you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.  Margaret, FYI to 
you, too.

Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.  Paul H., suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002.  Sadia, I think this is 
again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.  Margaret and 
Kathryn, also note.

Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
"not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation".  I may take 
issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.  Can you work with 
Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for 
my review (and presumably your's, too)?  thanks

Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions.    
thanks  mcs

Fiona Grant mentioned to me that you will be speaking at the Eurelectric 
meeting in Madrid on Monday and we thought that you might therefore be 
interested to see the attached note summarising the current PR situation with 
respect to our power plant developments in Spain.  

FYI Greenpeace is lobbying the Spanish Government heavily over the next few 
days in advance of the Bush visit - according to its website, will be calling 
for the Spanish Government to prohibit the development of power plants by US 
companies in protest at his policy on Kyoto.

Subject: Arcos/Tordesillas demonstrations 

This Sunday sees the demonstration in Arcos opposing the development of CCGTs 
in the region.  It is difficult to estimate likely turnout at the event - 
however the opposition Platform has been placing ads and has organised 
several buses from outside villages.  We are in contact with the Arcos Town 
Hall to see if they will be issuing official attendance numbers in advance of 
the opposition group, which can be sure to distort numbers.

Our PR consultant is in contact today with local media and will be in Arcos 
at the weekend to gauge the mood - if the demonstration does not attract many 
supporters, we will not comment publicly.  However, we will assess the 
situation on Sunday, and if there is a very large turnout, we may set up some 
interviews for Ignacio Soneira during the afternoon with local press and 
radio.  These interviews will be used to communicate that: Enron continues to 
believe in the positive benefits of the project for the region; the project 
has been subject to extensive public consultation; we have obtained our 
Environmental Impact Declaration and a large number of other permits; 
different opinions are to be welcomed in a democracy, and in fact the project 
does have support from many parts of the local community.

It is important to note that local politicians are setting great store by the 
success or otherwise of this weekend's demonstration - one key factor will be 
the ratio of Arcos residents present versus outsiders.  We will be continuing 
with our ongoing PR activities - adverts, presentations, sponsorships, 
interviews etc - next week, so that we are not seen to be backing off from 
the project following the demonstration.

Some local politicians are predicting that the level of turnout may in the 
end depend on the weather.  


Tordesillas

The demonstration which took place a few days ago in Tordesillas did attract 
a large number of local people (in the thousands).  The Tordesillas Mayor has 
now said that if local people are against the plant, then she too is against 
the project.  Our media response on this issue is that the consultation 
process is ongoing and that the Environmental Impact Report is due out within 
the next few weeks.  

The demonstration and the Mayor's position has attracted substantial local 
press coverage - the obvious concern is that these latest developments get 
picked up by newswires (one energy publication has picked up on the 
situation) and spread through Spain to Arcos.

Jackie Gentle and I will be visiting Tordesillas and Arcos next week to 
discuss the latest developments.

Subject: EU plans for single power market suffer setback.- Enron Mention- 
Reuters

This article/wire report from Reuters came in yesterday just as I left for a 
lecture, so I am only now forwarding it to you.  Joe tells me that Investor 
Relations has received some inquiries about "what is going on in Europe" 
yesterday, due to the bad headline Reuters chose below (aided by a 
self-serving European Commission official), and Dynegy's Q3 earnings showing 
red ink for Europe.  Ignoring the headline, and the quote from the European 
Commission civil servant (which I will elaborate upon below), this is a BIG 
WIN. It is progress for liberalisation, and I intend to tell The Economist 
just that when I do an interview with a reporter later today.  This story is 
about the DEMISE of the ill-conceived 2Euros/MWh export charge.  It stands 
truth and logic on its head to say, as the unnamed European official does, 
that the demise of the 2 euros charge was anything like "harmonisation" or 
that its demise sets back European liberalisattion.  It is now much more 
likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase 
trade, and certainly will not set back trade as the 2 euros would have.  Just 
to further de-construct the article, it was never a "single charge" (recall 
that new entrants disproportionately bore the burden, with many pre-existing 
contracts (of incumbents, since we did not exist in this market 3+ years ago) 
being exempt, nor would it contribute to a single market, but rather would 
have raised barriers to cross-border trade.  Moreover, the cost basis for the 
charge was never made transparent, either.  Finally, the rebate scheme likely 
would have subsidised the incumbents' competition against new entrants.  
There is a good quote from Peter Styles (and Peter deserves a great deal of 
recognition for leading the efforts to defeat this).  If you read the 
article, not the headline and European Commission official quote, you can see 
the other arguments against it, including the claim by German industrial 
consumers that it would have raised their prices by 10%.  Any message from PR 
or Investor Relations must be that this is a victory in the march towards a 
fully liberalised market, and a win for consumers.  The reason a European 
ommission official would say what they did is that they have been complicit 
in the German/Franco conspiracy to impose the 2 euros charge, and probably 
felt compelled to save face by saying this is a setback; otherwise, one would 
ask why were they working on/supporting something so deleterious to the 
development of the market?!

Apologies for being a bit lengthy, but I wrote this hopefully with sufficient 
detail that if you want to forward this to either PR or Investor Relations, 
they will be armed with enough info that they can respond to further 
inquiries.  By the way, we had an inkling of this via telephone coversation I 
had with UK DTI three days ago (communicated immediately to traders, just did 
not have time to summarise in an e-mail to you).  I will be summarising my 
conversation with UK DTI momentarily, even though it is 3 days old, because I 
will be adding some of her commentary on the wider political lay of the land, 
which I think you will want to read for the "big picture" of European 
machinations.  let me know if you need more.  thanks  mcs

UK:
EU plans for single power market suffer setback.
By Margaret Orgill

10/26/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Union hopes for a single electricity
market have suffered a setback after power companies and consumers failed to
agree a system for harmonising cross-border transmission tariffs, said
officials on Thursday.

Plans to introduce a single tariff for access to the west European grid by
November 1 have been postponed because of misgivings, particularly from some
power producers, said a European Union source.
"It seems that we have more problems than expected and the European Commission
could have to go for legislation," said the official, who declined to be
named.

The tariff is a voluntary proposal by western European grid operators to
harmonise cross border charges and create a single regional power market.

The official declined to give more details of the producers' doubts but
traders are opposed to the fee which they say is too high and will stifle the
emerging European power trading market.

The proposal has also run into legal problems in Germany where its
introduction would require changes to an industry agreement on access to the
regional electricity grid.

German consumer bodies are unlikely to accept the new tariff which will add
around 10 percent to wholesale power prices.

"The VIK, which represents industrial consumers, has already written to the
Commission saying they will not accept this fee," said Einar Vestra, managing
director of the trading division at Mannheim-based utility MVV.

TARIFF TO BE DISCUSSED BY EU, INDUSTRY

The tariff will be discussed by the so-called Florence group, which includes
EU officials, government and industry representatives, which is due to meet
again on November 9-10.

If the voluntary approach does not work, Brussels may decide to include
provisions on cross-border transmission in a forthcoming directive to speed up
the opening of Europe's electricity markets.

Grid operators have proposed a flat charge of two euros per megawatt hour for
exports regardless of how many borders the power crosses, instead of charging
a fee at each frontier.

The funds from the tariff will be put in a central pot and divided among grid
owners to reimburse network transit costs, estimated at around 200 million
euros a year.

Traders argue the fee is too expensive and object to the fact the grid
companies want to charge it only on new contracts and exempt existing
long-term contracts.

"An export-related transmission fee was misconceived in the first place," said
Peter Styles, vice president of European government affairs at U.S. utility
Enron.

"The priority in the Florence process should be greater harmonisation between
access regimes in member states...with a view of achieving transmission
tariffs which include cross border access."

German court orders Ruhrgas to open gas grid to Trianel
A district court in Dortmund has ordered Ruhrgas to grant access
to its gas transport network to German-Dutch energy JV Trianel
with immediate effect, Trianel said Monday. The decision, which
followed a hearing Sep 1, allows Trianel to start supplying two
large customers under new contracts from Oct 1, 2000. The court
dismissed Ruhrgas' arguments that the present access case was
irrelevant, as the two unnamed customers were still bound by
existing long-term deals with other suppliers. This argument had
no bearing on network access, the court said, and Trianel should
not be forced to rely on other more expensive transport options.
This is the second access case Ruhrgas has lost since the gas
market was opened to competition in August. On Aug 24, the
Cartel Office ordered it to grant access to US trader Enron.

Trianel Monday welcomed the court's decision as an important
step in the liberalization of the German gas market, and noted
that the victory was all the more significant given the lack of
clear legislation on this issue. Current regulations contain
insufficient provisions to ensure third party access to the gas
network, it said. The Energy Law covers independent claims by
third parties to use the electricity transmission network, under
Article 6, Paragraph, but not the gas system. German legislators
have so far rejected calls for a change in the Energy Law in
connection with the implementation of the European directive on
gas market opening, arguing that Competition Law contained ample
provision in Article 19, Paragraph 4 on "essential facilities,"
to which Trianel referred in its case.


Ruhrgas still to decide whether to appeal access ruling
Germany's Ruhrgas has still not decided whether to appeal a
court order to grant access to its gas network to Dutch-German
JV Trianel, a spokesman for the company said Monday. "We first
want to see the official written explanation for the court's
decision," the spokesman said. "Then we will decide whether to
appeal." Ruhrgas had argued that in both cases where Trianel
requested access to supply new industrial customers deliveries
would involve a breach of existing supply contracts. But this
factor was dismissed by the Dortmund court as incidental to the
access case. It ruled Trianel should not have to rely on more
expensive transit options. Ruhrgas would be talking to Trianel
in the hope of reaching an out-of-court solution to the dispute,
the spokesman added. If it failed, it would consider an appeal.

I would add to what Teun says below a good lesson from California for the 
Dutch: Disconnect the functioning of the retail and wholesale markets at your 
peril. If bad regulatory/ political  intervention gets in the way of 
participation by new and old players in both on a level playing field, 
fingers will get burnt. In the Netherlands the incumbent generators and 
vertically integrated distributors have been given unfair advantages in a 
non-transparent manner in the wholesale market, whilst enjoying more or less 
guaranteed prices in the retail market. New entrants/ importers got squeezed 
and most consumers have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of liberalisation. 
Incidentally, in both California and the Netherlands there was excessive 
political trumpeting of the benefits and of the enlightenment of policymakers 
in advance, followed by a mess in practice.

Peter, Nailia,

Today Dutch bank holiday, heard nevertheless your voicemail, please find 
below initial thoughts in bullet format:



Why California cannot happen in the Dutch market:

? Plenty installed capacity available 
Available import capacity about 30% of total demand
Price cap for distco's based on real quarterly purchase portfolio and 
industry average index 


Why California nevertheless -in the longer run- can happen:

? CHP plants are closed down and large generators are shutting down plants
Lack of grid system transparency with regards to importcapacity, operational 
aspects of the grid, balancing market etc. Biased signals to the market.  
Market structure with limited number of players therefore lack of 
competition. Prices do not reflect underlying market supply and demand ratio. 
Therefore new entrants are hesitating to add new assets to the market.
Environmental and spatial permits are time consuming processes. (e.g. 
National Government faces large resistance of local authorities against the 
siting of windmills). Governmental Policy aims at state of the art technology 
of new additions to the powerplantmix. Environmental Impact Report often 
necessary. 


Teun

The EU summary is okay for someone wishing to get a quick overview.  A few 
errors, though.  Spanish pool is not mandatory.  If you own generation in the 
country, you may bypass the pool.  Denmark has more than two generators, as 
municipalities own a fair amount of generation.  Finally, the 
anti-competitive arrangements in place as "transitional" in The Netherlands 
are not touched upon at all.

Interesting omission of Poland from discussion of Central and Eastern Europe, 
as it is the most progressive of the countries from the former Communist 
sphere.   
thanks for sending this along.   mcs

       Power sector restructuring: international activity, June - November
       2000


      This  mailing is a periodic update of the status of international
      electric power sector privatization and restructuring.


      Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace.
      Governments faced with burgeoning power demands, but lacking the
      funds to meet them, are nearly universally opening their generation
      markets to foreign investors, even where privatization is not on the
      agenda.  More and more, state-owned utilities are unbundling.
      Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the
      wholesale and retail levels.  A few international players have scaled
      back their international investments and shifted substantial portions
      of their portfolio to less risky markets, such as the U.S. or Europe.
      Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive.  As Asian
      economies recover, most governments are starting to move forward
      again with unbundling / restructuring plans.  After a year in which
      currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit
      Latin America, a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to
      restart, but at a slower pace.


      This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific,
      Latin America, and the Middle East / Africa. Maps that summarize the
      status of restructuring in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa
      and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits 1-4.  A slippery slope
      is Exhibit 5.  Timelines showing the opening of markets in various
      countries, by region, are in Exhibits 6-8.


      (See attached file: Intlmail 3 exhibits.ppt)













      February '99 marked the opening of the market to choice for most
      large EU customers who use over 40 GWh a year.  This accounts for
      about a fourth of demand.  As of "E-Day", neither France nor Italy
      had passed their proposed enabling legislation.  While the EU
      intended for the transmission operator to be independent, EDF intends
      to retain control over the grid, as will ENEL.  A phased deregulation
      of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in
      August 2000.


      Mergers, alliances, and consolidation are a dominant theme as
      companies jockey for position in the new European power market.
      There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross
      borders: as suppliers of new generation, as purchasers of assets
      being spun off by liberalization decrees (Italy) or because of market
      concentration rulings in mergers (Germany, Spain). Several
      international companies have opened trading offices in Europe, or  (
      Enron, Reliant, Southern, TXU).  HoustonStreet.com launched a
      European online wholesale energy-trading platform.


           ?  Austria:  Austria's liberalizing market is facing problems
              from within and without.  The EU is dissatisfied with its
              lack of G-T-D unbundling, although accounts were formally
              separated in 1999.  There is no ISO.  Internally, there is
              intense discussion about an accelerated market opening
              (customers over 20 GWh now have choice). Regional utilities
              are angry over the Verbund's proposal to open 100% of the
              market in late 2001. The Verbund, a 51% SOU, is the largest
              generator and owns the transmission grid. However, it has no
              retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already
              deregulated wholesale customers. (C.B. White, Judith Lezaun)

           ?  Denmark: The 1999 liberalization law exceeds the EU
              directive's goals and establishes full retail access by 2003.
              Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than
              100 GWh in 1997;  the threshold dropped in April '00 more
              than 10 GWh; the next threshold drops to 1GWh at the end of
              2000. The new law includes unbundling of distribution
              activity and regulated TPA. Denmark has recently experienced
              a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector
              with 2 large incumbents. The trend is moving downstream into
              distribution and supply. Western Denmark is already part of
              the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to
              join by the end of 2000. Energy policy aims at twenty percent
              of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of
              2003, up from a current 10%. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Finland: Finland has been fully open to choice since
              September 1998, when a metering requirement was dropped.
              Prices immediately dropped, but only about 2-3% of households
              have switched supplier. Finland forms part of the Nordic
              power exchange NordPool. The regulator monitors distribution
              tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place. In November '98, the
              Finnish government launched an IPO for 20% of Fortum, the
              holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy
              and oil and gas company Neste Oy. The Finnish government
              expects to lower its ownership further. The largest new
              entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall, with its
              acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity.
              Further M&A in the distribution and supply sector is
              expected. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  France: There was irony in France's push for liberalization
              as it assumed its six-month EU presidency.    France passed
              its electricity law last February, a year after required by
              EU directive, but had 30-odd implementation decrees stalled
              in the National Assembly.  However, EDF, which still controls
              more than 95% of French generation, realized Brussels would
              hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained
              closed. It recently convinced French authorities to open up
              34% of the market by the end of 2000 instead of 2003,
              lowering the eligibility threshold to 9 GWh/year (from 16
              GWh). EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from
              easily entering the energy services market  -- leading EDF to
              promote a "relatively rapid" total opening of the French
              market. (Corinne Aigroz, White)

           ?   Germany:  While the Electricity Law was officially effective
              in April '98, real competition is still impeded by
              complicated TPA grid access conditions, especially on the
              retail market. A group of new entrants has organized to call
              for a governmental regulator.  Some recent studies have shown
              the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a
              "massive cross-subsidization between network operations and
              marketing." Recent charges have been made of obstacles to
              competition by a mulitiplicity of fees, including customer
              switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies.
              In the last 12 months, M&A among big national and
              international utilities has redrawn the German utility
              landscape: EDF bought a share in EnBW, Veba / Viag merged to
              form EON and RWE/VEW merged into RWE. Furthermore, RWE and
              EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust
              authority.  Currently, several utilities are and battling for
              control of East German VEAG, whose transmission connections
              make it a portal to Eastern Europe.  (Judith Lezaun, White)

           ?  Greece: According to the FT, Greece has "hired a consultant"
              (us) to produce a 5-year plan for state utility PPC.  PPC is
              preparing an IPO for 15-20% of the company, theoretically set
              for 2001, but likely later.  Greece has been given until 2001
              by the EU to conform to the Directive. An IEA report
              suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector
              structure.  First, the government should create a clearer
              separation between itself and the state-owned PPC, including
              a separate regulatory agency.  Second, the government should
              consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to
              maximize competition, as well as improving market access
              conditions for IPPs and cogenerators.  As the country's
              largest employer, PPC is not likely to effect these changes
              quickly. (White, Thomas Read)

           ?  Ireland: Supply competition was introduced in February '00
              for customers over 4 GWh (28% of the market).  Opening is
              scheduled to increase to 32% in 2003, with further
              liberalisation in 2006.  No date for mid-market and full
              retail opening has been set.   Incumbent ESB plans to split
              off its transmission business, which will remain state-owned.
              Competition in generation will be introduced in 2002 with the
              auctioning of ESB capacity, which is intended to create at
              least two new players.  Independent power production has been
              allowed for two years now. (Ben Joyce)

           ?  Italy:  Italy approved its market deregulation decree in
              March '99; in some measures, it goes beyond the EU Directive.
              ENEL had dominated 80% of generation; by 2003, no entity can
              control more than 50%, or 30% by 2005.  This requires that
              ENEL sell between 15GW and 22GW of its 57GW by 2003.  It has
              separated G-T-D into separate legal entities and been 34.5%
              privatized.  A second tranche should take place in 2001.  A
              pool mechanism should be operating by 2001.  Consortia of
              industrials using more 30GWh/year can contract directly with
              IPPs; by 2002, the threshold will be 9GWh/ year. The
              potential free market currently amounts to 80 TWh a year, or
              30% of total demand.  This will increase to 40% in 2002.
              ENEL, who has a de facto monopoly on T&D, will retain
              ownership of the national grid assets; a separate state-run
              ISO, GRTN, will run transmission and dispatching.  A pool
              mechanism, operated by a GRTN subsidiary, should be operating
              by 2001; in the meantime, the market uses bilateral
              contracts. (Valentina Grifo, White)

           ?  Netherlands:  By June '00 three of the four large generation
              companies had been sold to foreign energy groups.
              Competition for large industrial users began in August '98.
              Large industrials (33% of the market) can currently choose
              their supplier.  By 2002, 58% of the market will be
              competitive, and in 2004, there will be full customer choice.
              The Amsterdam Power Exchange, modeled along Scandinavian
              lines, was launched in May '99.  The APX allows players to
              trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next
              day.  In April '00, it added day-ahead prices at border
              points for Germany, although it is not yet much used; if
              successful, Belgium would follow. In October '00, the
              government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network,
              TenneT, from the four generation companies for $99.1 million.
              Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase
              real competition. (White, Karel Tutein Nolthenius)

           ?  Norway:  Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop
              in 1991. "Real" retail access got started in 1995 when the
              meter requirement was abolished; switching got started in
              1997 when a switching fee was canceled.  The current
              accumulated switching rate lies at 14%. Distribution tariffs
              are regulated and transparent according to rTPA. Norway forms
              part of NordPool. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Portugal: Portugal brought new regulations into force in
              January '99.  They include a price-cap system for determining
              tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems:
              public and independent.  Each is locked into supplying the
              national grid (REN), a regulated and EdP-owned monopoly.
              Producers within the independent system can currently supply
              eligible customers who consume more than 9GWh/year at a
              single site.  The country's four discos may purchase up to 8%
              of consumption outside the public system.  Portugal's
              regulator, ERSE, needs either to extend the eligible
              customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to
              reach the percents required by the Directive.  The government
              sold another stake of 20% of state-owned Electricidade de
              Portugal in October '00, following two successful offerings
              in '97 and '98.   This offering raised $1.34 billion.  The
              state retains 32.6% and "golden share" voting rights. (Rui de
              Sousa)

           ?  Spain: After several major Latin American purchases, Endesa
              moved to restructure and consolidate at home, announcing in
              October '00 the merger with Iberdrola.  The resulting company
              would have 80% of the market, so it would be forced to shed
              generation and distribution assets.  It would also create the
              world's 4th largest utility, by market cap. There is also
              movement with the smaller two players.

              The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule
              faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive
              providing for full market opening by January 2003. Several
              foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible
              consumers and there are new generation capacity additions
              announced by some of the large international. Nearly 60% of
              the market can now choose its supplier.  A mandatory pool
              with a bidding system started in Jan '98. (White, Dominguez)

           ?   Sweden: Deregulation was introduced in January '96 with full
              retail access to all customer groups, rTPA and unbundling of
              distribution activities. However, switching was impeded by a
              meter requirement that was abolished in November '99.
              Switching is currently at 10% but with renegotiated contracts
              the figure is more like 25%. Sweden forms part of NordPool, a
              "common electricity market", a forum for physical and
              financial exchanges. Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market
              and an OTC market for financial trading. Consolidation has
              occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation
              market is concentrated in the hands of 3 large actors.
              (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Switzerland: In October '00, Parliament passed an electricity
              market law.  The first phase of the liberalization should
              start in 2001 granting choice to large industrials (> 20
              GWh); the mid-size market will open in 2004 (> 10 GWh). In
              2007, the law envisions a fully open market. Some aspects of
              the new law, such as the transmission tariff model, are still
              being discussed. (Chris Brombacher, White)

           ?  UK: With market deregulation complete (full choice since May
              1999), the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply
              consolidation.  Seven of the 12 RECs in England & Wales are
              now in joint ownership.  In the generation market, the
              incumbent's share continues to decline: National Power and
              PowerGen have divested further capacity, and now stand at
              8.5% and 6.7%.

              The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have
              been postponed to early 2001.  They will allow for a futures
              and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot
              market.  Markets will be run by independent members, although
              the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a
              system operator as before.  A bilateral power exchange will
              also be put in, and is expected to handle a much larger
              demand than the spot market. (Ben Joyce)







      In Central and Eastern Europe, privatization initiatives are
      continuing to attract badly needed capital, while the IMF urges
      reforms as a condition for funding.  Countries that are looking to EU
      membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and
      gradual opening of their markets to choice.

           ?  Bulgaria: In January, the Energy Agency announced its intent
              to unbundle the state monopoly, NEK, into separate G-T-D
              companies.  NEK will remain a single buyer; 28 distribution
              entities have been merged into seven new companies.  The
              unions are opposing rapid reform, claiming the necessary
              regulations have not yet been written.  The government is
              working with the IMF to set up financial controls and
              eliminate cross-subsidies.  Between 2001 and 2005, all
              generation will be upgraded or privatized.  Transmission will
              remain state-owned.  (Csilla Ilkei, White)

           ?  The Czech Republic: In October '00, the Czech government
              announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ
              and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single
              buyer. Privatization is expected to begin in 2001.  Many
              Western companies, such as Vattenfall and E.On have already
              been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors
              who need the cash to balance their budgets. A new energy law
              should be also approved by the end of 2000, which would open
              power markets to competition between 2002 and 2006; prices
              should reflect costs by 2002.  Gas liberalization will follow
              in 2005.  CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant,
              Temelin, which should begin operating by spring 2001. CEZ
              plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by 20% after the
              commercial launch of Temelin. (Kristina Kalinova, White)

           ?  Hungary: Since December '95, majority shares have been sold
              in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western
              investors.   Eastern Europe's  earliest and most ambitious
              privatization program has fallen victim to a host of
              problems, especially central government price control.  AES
              and IVO-Tomen tendered new capacity tendered in 1999, but AES
              is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign
              its agreed-on PPA.   Hungary will partially deregulate its
              market after 2002 but before it joins the EU. Further
              privatization opportunities include a coal-fired power plant
              as well as the monopoly transco, MVM. (Cs. Ilkei, White)

           ?  Moldova: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
              has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of
              Modova, giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost.
              Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution
              companies, then in three generators. The first attempt to
              privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids.  All
              companies will require substantial investment for upgrades.
              (White)

           ?  Romania: In September '00, the national electric company,
              Conel, was split into four independent units. These encompass
              fossil generation, hydro generation, transmission, and
              distribution and metering. Restructuring precedes eventual
              privatization, which will begin with distribution, followed
              by generation.  Current law requires foreign owners to have a
              local partner.  As Romania is one of the countries invited to
              join accession talks with the EU, it is opening its market in
              stages.  Currently, 10% (>100GWh) has choice; this will rise
              to 45% (>40GWh) next year.  Evenually, elegibility thresholds
              will be lowered to 20GWh, then 9GWh. (Cs. Ilkei,White)

           ?  Russia: In the mid-1990s, the Unified Energy Systems of
              Russia Joint Stock Company (UES; also known as RAO), was
              organized into 72 regional joint stock companies; UES still
              holds 49% shares in most of these regional utilities.  In May
              '00, President Putin fired the non-reformist energy minister
              who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and
              liberalization.  The new minister is an unknown quantity.
              The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions
              of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls, currently at
              25%. (White)

           ?  Slovak Republic: In October 2000 the government approved a
              plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy
              sector; implementation legislation needs to be passed.  The
              plan would see state-owned Slovenske Elektrarne (the G-T-D
              monopoly) transformed into a 100% state-owned joint stock
              company.   Regional distributors will be separated from SE
              and merged in the first half of 2001 into three joint-stock
              companies, with a 49% block of shares to be sold.  Generation
              will also be separated and transformed into joint stock
              companies. Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the
              heating plants.  The government will select a privatization
              adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early
              2001. (Kristina Kalinova)

           ?  Turkey: The controversy over BOO (build-own-operate) vs. BOT
              (build-operate-transfer) arrangements for IPPs was resolved
              in January 2000.  Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional
              amendment allowing international arbitration for energy
              contracts.  Twenty-three BOT projects are affected.  Turkish
              economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to
              64 GW by 2010.  In September, Turkey proposed an energy law
              that would separate state-owned TEAS into separate G-T-D
              entities.  Generation plants would eventually be available
              for privatization, while new plants would no longer be
              transferred to the government, but remain with the IPP
              builder.  The impetus for this proposed law is Turkey's
              interest in EU membership; only 1/8th of its 120 energy
              regulations meets EU standards.  (White)

           ?  Ukraine:  Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the
              country's 27 regional discos, in a transparent tender.   Such
              a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before.  Each sale will
              be for 25% plus one share. The distribution sector is beset
              with a host of problems including high non-payment, unpaid
              employees, and corruption.  The EBRD is pushing for progress
              on privatization before it provides funds to build an
              alternative to Chernobyl, which the authorities have agreed
              to close.









      Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some
      countries electricity demand is returning to pre-crisis levels.  Most
      governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling /
      restructuring plans in the power sector; although IPPs are facing
      ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees.


           ?  Australia:  All customers in Australia should have choice by
              2003.  Victoria will to phase in full competition during
              2001.  New South Wales (NSW) has delayed full competition for
              residential users and small businesses to January '02.  The
              five other states plan to phase in full choice by 2003.
              Victoria's five distributors are facing revenue reductions of
              between 12% and 22% starting in 2001, whey they say will hurt
              their service capability.  Recent M&A activity has seen
              already- privatized Victorian distribution, retail, and
              transmission change hands, with new owners coming from Asia.
              ElectraNet, South Australia's (SA) transco, was sold as a
              200-year lease in September.  The National Electricity
              Market, comprising Victoria and NSW, started operating in
              December '99.  Queensland, SA and ACT will join in the next
              few years.

           ?  China:  China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,
              including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased
              interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai
              provinces.  As there is no process or body in place to
              oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere
              slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs
              following a government decision to cap the ROR for new
              projects at 10%.  Another issue is lack of government
              guarantees.  China plans to build hundreds of small rural
              hydro projects and to spend Yn55bn to upgrade rural power
              grids in 2000 as part of a project to bring electricity to 75
              million people who currently have no access.

           ?  India:  Five of India's 19 states have undertaken significant
              reforms: Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
              Uttar Pradesh.  And, only four of the State Electricity
              Boards (SEBs), the principal buyers for independent power,
              are profitable.  IPP builders have been frustrated by a host
              of regulations, lack of guarantees, and SEB insolvencies.
              The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted
              this year by the withdrawal of two major investors, EdF and
              Cogentrix.
              A draft "Electricity Bill 2000" will be introduced in
              Parliament this winter.  It would create and empower
              autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions.  SEBs
              would be unbundled into G-T-D and corporatized within four
              months of passage.  Initially, states would initially retain
              G&D assets; they would later be privatized.  Transmission
              assets would be put under an independent authority, and TPA
              would be allowed.  Significantly, IPP licensing requirements
              would be clarified and reduced, and largely eliminated for
              the growing segment of captive producers.  A key problem of
              theft ? as high as 30% of T&D losses in some areas ? would be
              addressed by strict metering and high penalties.  The
              likelihood, however, of the Bill being passed as proposed is
              not strong, as it faces significant opposition both by unions
              and regional parties in Parliament.

           ?  Indonesia:  Indonesia's IPP program has faced problems over
              power purchase costs and project rates of return, with
              bankrupt state-owned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP
              operators for power.  Of 27 planned IPP projects, only three
              now supply power; six others are ready to generate.  PLN
              reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which
              Paiton will supply energy for 10 months, at a rate said to be
              much lower than the original agreed-upon price.  Other PPA
              renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss
              until the Indonesian economy revives and PLN's financial
              situation improves.  Unbundling is underway on Java/Bali,
              where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries.  Outside
              Java/Bali, unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines.
              The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting
              to develop rules for a competitive market.

           ?  Japan:  On March 21, 8000 large customers (30% of the market)
              were allowed to choose a supplier.  This broke the monopolies
              of the ten regional IOUs for the first time, but high
              transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting
              true competition. Newer liberalization measures in the
              electricity and gas sectors have since been written --  an
              agreement was signed at the July G8 Summit which provides for
              fair and transparent non-discriminatory access to
              distribution networks in both sectors.  A number of new
              companies are entering (or planning to enter) the market,
              largely set up as JVs with local non-incumbents, often
              offering new products and services.
              In August the government awarded a tender to a non-utility,
              Diamond Power, a Mitsubishi unit, to supply electricity to
              the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate 4% lower than
              incumbent TEPCO's.  TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant
              to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in
              the face of increased competition.

           ?  Malaysia:  Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman
              of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in July.  He assured
              investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his
              predecessor would remain intact.  TNB will be transformed
              into two separate T&D companies by 2003, with an equity
              interest in generation.  Generation assets have already been
              separated into TNB Generation; thermal generation will be
              sold.   The government has approved the construction of more
              IPPs to meet the demand for electricity, which has grown 12%
              compared to the period before the economic crisis.  Work on
              the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed, but it
              remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as
              originally planned or on a smaller scale.

           ?  New Zealand: 1999 saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create
              further competition  -- Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, and
              Mighty River Power.  They have been corporatized but will
              remain under government ownership.  Legislation passed in
              1999 forbade ownership of wires (non-competitive) and
              generation and retailing (competitive) by the same company.
              Companies have until 2004 either to sell one business type or
              to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they
              do not wish to keep. By February '00, most had implemented
              full separation.  The newly merged (75.8%) NGC/TransAlta will
              be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand, with a market
              cap of NZ$2.1billion and more than 650,000 customers.

           ?  Pakistan:  Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated
              PPAs which allow fixed ROR of 12%, but IPPs face continued
              lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties.
              Problems continue over Hub Power Company (Hubco), the largest
              IPP project in Pakistan.  Hubco is receiving significantly
              lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted.  The
              government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA
              was amended in the 1990's, making the wholesale power tariff
              untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco.
              More than 20% of plants have already been sold in a phased
              sell-off of WAPDA's generation.  Eight parties have been
              short-listed for the pending privatization of 51% of Karachi
              Electric Supply Commission, but the sale has been often
              delayed.

           ?  Philippines:   An Omnibus Electricity Bill, which will set
              the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor,
              is stalled in a House-Senate reconciliation committee.  The
              Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all
              financial assistance, including $100million in loans for
              power related projects, until the legislation is passed.
              Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department
              officials are looking at several alternate options for
              selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill.
              Government-appointed advisers have also recommended that
              Napocor renegotiate some of its take-or-pay contracts with
              IPPs, asking some IPPs to reduce power off-take on an interim
              basis.  Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these
              conditions a longer life span for their projects, but
              developers are reluctant to accept because of their own
              financial commitments.

           ?  Singapore:  Since initial restructuring and corporatization
              in 1995 and the establishment of a pool in 1998, Singapore
              has lagged in power sector deregulation.  Investors complain
              that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has
              yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for
              large consumers.  A thorough review in 1999 by the Ministry
              of Trade and Industry recommended that:  generation  be
              privatized, but with restrictions on generation
              cross-ownership; transmission and market operation functions
              be separated and an ISO established; and that most retail
              services be privatized.  The government has granted two
              public retail licenses, meaning that the two IPPs can sell
              electricity directly to large users.  Retail licenses are
              expected to be issued to the three power generators.  This
              will allow full competition for large industrial and
              commercial customers, but retail competition for smaller
              customers is unlikely to be in place before 2002.

           ?  South Korea: South Korea is proceeding with a major
              restructuring program, following government approval in July
              1999 for state-owned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos.
              KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco.  Each of
              the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea
              Stock Exchange; up to 30% foreign ownership will be
              permitted.  The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO, which
              will initially retain its T&D services.  Later, a UK-type
              pool will be established where all generators will sell into
              the pool. Competition in distribution and retailing is a
              long-term target.  IPP projects totaling 2,515MW are already
              in operation.  Impending restructuring has not deterred
              foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs.

           ?  Taiwan: Two phases of IPP development have been approved, but
              only one IPP scheme has started up.   Developers have faced
              land acquisition problems, causing IPP schedules to slip.  In
              1999, the government announced plans to launch Phase Three,
              limited to gas-fired plants.  An Electricity Act is before
              Parliament.  Its main provisions include: privatizing
              Taipower without unbundling G-T-D; allowing other companies
              to enter the market as either vertically integrated,
              generation, transmission or distribution companies and to pay
              Taipower a fee for using its facilities; and the creation of
              an independent regulator, especially for tariffs.  IPPs will
              be able to supply customers at 161kV and above, and IPP
              prices will not be regulated.

           ?  Thailand: The 1999 State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid
              out a three-stage process for all state-owned enterprises,
              including power, to create fully competitive, restructured
              and privatized sectors.  A draft Energy Act is under
              discussion, while preparation and implementation of various
              technical frameworks are underway. Under the Act, a
              competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in 2003,
              although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then.
              It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent
              and independent regulatory body. EGAT transferred two thermal
              units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October; EGAT also
              plans to corporatize and partially privatize its non-hydro
              plants by 2003.  Before the economic crisis, the government
              had an ambitious IPP program; EGAT now has excess capacity,
              so has delayed many projects.  Its long-term plans include
              the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants (SPPs)
              using renewable energy.  PPAs have been signed with 50 SSPs.

           ?  Vietnam: Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its
              power system. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is an unbundled
              state monopoly, which does not even service rural customers.
              Local villages provide services to small farmers and small
              commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards. The
              World Bank has approved a $150million credit to Vietnam to
              extend grid electricity to about 450,000 households scattered
              throughout the country.  A few IPPs are trying to win
              generation projects.   An Electricity Law due to be enacted
              in 2001 would establish a National Electricity Office for
              regulation.   This would replace the existing haphazard
              village-level regulatory system.





      Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations, many
      Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations.  At
      the same time, ownership limits imposed by several governments limit
      further investments by companies who have already entered the market.
      According to the Inter-American Development Bank, privatization of
      electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all
      of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of
      Venezuela and Mexico.  It estimates that 75 million Latin Americans
      are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer
      countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and some Central American countries.
      Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are
      beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to
      investments.  And for those who were already open, a new development
      is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either
      as concessions to build or as full privatizations.  A big factor
      impacting generation this year has been the region's heavy reliance
      on hydro-power.  Serious region-wide droughts during the last few
      years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors.


           ?  Argentina:  The big news is in Argentina transmission sector.
              This fall, Argentina auctioned off 25% of Transener in an
              IPO, while also offering six lines to the private sector on a
              B-O-M (build-operate-maintain) basis. Endesa (Spain) must
              divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to
              antitrust concerns  (Endesa's two companies are now serving
              40% of the countries 36 million people).  The regulator
              believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate
              efficiency and to set prices.

           ?  Brazil:   Brazil's wholesale energy market (WEM) began
              operating in October; initially, only 5-10% of power bought
              or sold will go through WEM.  As other contracts expire it
              will eventually supervise $15 billion worth of power.  The
              WEM intends also to create an internet-based trading system.
              The Brazilian system, 95% hydro-run, is dependent on
              plentiful rains to avoid shortages.   Demand growth has far
              outstripped GDP, while new generation is not keeping pace.
              Analysts predict a 15% shortage in 2001, with intermittent
              brownouts, while neighbors are building generation with an
              eye to exporting power to Brazil.
              Sao Paulo state will sell 38.6% of CESP Parana, one of the
              last large generation privatizations,  in December.  The
              state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any
              premium paid over the minimum price of R1.74 billion (US$
              901mil).  Brazil also conducted a successful action of three
              transmission lines in August on a build-operate basis.

           ?  Bolivia:  Ende, Bolivia's utility, was unbundled in '94 and
              has been successively sold off through capitalization (a 50%
              stake and management control).  To meet demand rising at 7.5%
              annually, the government has ordered these buyers to invest
              $296 million in the next three years or face losing their
              concessions; they have not fulfilled previous obligations in
              upgrades.   Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow
              distributors to generate up to 30% of demand instead of 15%.

           ?  Chile: Privatization in Chile is largely complete. Endesa's
              (Spain) controversial takeover of Enersis (Chile) will be the
              basis for its diversification into telecom, via its
              subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra.  Partially in response to
              Endesa's vertical dominance, partially in response to supply
              conditions engendered by prolonged drought, and partially to
              increase competition, Chile has proposed new regulation plans
              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.  Until now,
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators.  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for
              the 100% sale of Transelec in September.
              1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously
              affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of
              Chile's generation.  Under the existing system, generators
              had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.  Chile hopes
              the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to
              generation and to introduce competition into distribution,
              heretofore a monopoly.

           ?  Colombia: Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks
              against transmission installations have forced the government
              to postpone the sale of any further power assets, including
              Isagen, the state generator, ISA, the transco, as well as 14
              regional distributors. (A March attack, for instance, caused
              a blackout in 9 provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or
              more.)  The government claims to be reassessing the rules,
              but the reality is that the assets would not receive any
              decent offer now.  For now, 100- 300 million new shares
              (13.5% of capital) in ISA will be sold to the public at a 15%
              discount, to "democratize" the power sector. Since January
              '00, 90% of the market has had choice.

           ?  Cuba:  The first IPP began delivering power to Cuba's grid in
              October '98.  In order to curb programmed blackouts, it has
              invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new
              crude reserves.  Cuba hopes that 70% of its power will be
              generated from local fuels by year-end.

           ?  Dominican Republic: Blackouts still plague this nation a year
              after the government split state-owned CDE into separate
              G-T-D units.  Investors paid $750 for a 50% stake and
              management control of non-hydro generation and of
              distribution.  The new government is requiring IPPs (who
              provide 40% of the republic's power) to renegotiate the terms
              of the privatization contracts signed with the prior
              government.  In the hopes of increasing competition and
              lowering prices, the gencos are planning a power
              clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to T&D
              companies.  It will, however, "only function when there is
              adequate electricity to meet demand."

           ?  Ecuador: The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale
              of its power sector.  There is a current investment limit of
              39%, which may need to be raised to 51%.  The government
              realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization
              in order to attract capital.  Its largest utility, EMELEC,
              will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive
              debts.

           ?  El Salvador: In October, AES bought Reliant's interest in
              three discos (privatized in 1998), which together serve 60%
              of the population.  CEL, the SOU, does not plan to privatize
              its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment.

           ?  Guatemala:  Guatemala sold two major discos in 1998;
              investors have made significant system upgrades.  State
              utility INDE still owns 45% of the country's generation, all
              in hydro.  It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early 90s
              with take-or-pay PPAs; IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid
              access.  The power sector, while needing new investment for
              the next five years, may soon be in trouble due to currency
              devaluation, high fuel costs, and the effect of the PPAs.
              Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing
              regulations to their 1997 law to encourage more investment.

           ?  Jamaica:  For the second time in four years, the Jamaican
              government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC, which
              handles all of T&D and 75% of the island's generation.  And,
              for the second time, it is Southern who is in the forefront
              of privatization negotiations.  It is still not clear what
              percent will be sold, but it seems likely to be a marginal
              minority of 45%, without G-T-D first being spun-off.

           ?  Mexico: The new Fox administration plans to revive
              electricity reform, tabled last year, without which energy
              cannot keep pace with economic growth.  Fox says there will
              be no privatizations, but an opening of the market.  Private
              participation in the distribution sector would require a
              constitutional change.  Many believe that constitutional
              change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms.
              Mexico estimates it needs investments of $25 billion in the
              power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand;
              reserve margins are at 6%, while consumption is growing at 6%
              - 8% annually.  Without a clear regulatory bill opening the
              market to competition, investment is inhibited.  IPPs have
              heretofore been built on a B-O-O basis.  Recent tenders have
              included the option to build either in the U.S. or Mexico,
              with power dedicated to Mexico.

           ?  Nicaragua:   The privatization of state-owned power company
              (ENEL) is underway, following its restructuring.  Assets were
              first split into G-T-D companies.  In September '00, Spain's
              Union Fenosa acquired 95% of two discos for $115 million in
              an auction in which it was the sole bidder. High oil prices
              forced the government to postpone the October sale of the
              three gencos; two of the three pre-qualified companies failed
              to submit final bids.  Also, the political opposition has
              challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme
              Court.

           ?  Panama: Privatization of government-held IRHE is now
              complete; 51% of distribution and generation was sold in
              1998. The government plans to retain control of transmission.
              Foreign investors are involved in building some generation.
              The big news is the Central American integrated grid, which
              should join Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
              Costa Rica, and Panama into a single market by 2006.  The
              IADB is running project.

           ?  Peru: The new Energy Minister, Chamot, favors re-starting the
              privatization program, stalled since September '99.  SOUs
              mentioned for privatization were six regional energy
              companies, as well as a 850MW Andean hydro complex, Mantaro.
              It was not clear what form privatization would take; nor is
              it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and
              fled.  Peru also announced bids for construction and
              operation of two transmission lines.  Currently, only large
              industrials, representing 10% of the market, have choice.
              There are no plans to expand this.

           ?  Trinidad and Tobago: While there has been a partial
              unbundling of the generation arm of T&TEC, the government
              utility retains control of T&D as well as of all of natural
              gas purchases.  There been neither much IPP nor privatization
              activity since the sale of 49% of T&TEC to Southern and BP
              Amoco in 1996 and the financing of one IPP in 1998.

           ?   Venezuela: The Chavez government imposed an electricity
              restructuring law in August 1999.  Industrials can choose
              their supplier, but there are no plans to open the market
              completely.  A wholesale market is proposed for 2002.
              Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere,
              due to high subsidization.  While the government dithered on
              privatization plans, AES jumped in with a surprise bid for
              the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas.  The government recently
              announced a tentative sale date of early 2001 for 51% of two
              regional electric companies, Enelven and Semda.
              Privatization has oft been postponed, most recently because
              of unknown effects of Venezuela's new electricity law on its
              rate policy.

           ? Virgin Islands: In September '00, this U.S. territory's Senate
             quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for
             an 80% purchase of the Water and Power Authority.  The Islands
             could use the money, but the Senate objected to the lack of
             bidding or transparency.  It was in principle opposed neither
             to privatization nor to Southern.






      African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their
      power sectors to foreign investment, although most have not moved
      beyond allowing IPPs.  Many Gulf-States' IPPs are for water and
      power.   Increasingly, power sector forecasts include reliance on the
      private sector for generation capacity additions.  Five Sub-Saharan
      countries have privatized their power systems: C"te d'Ivoire, Gabon,
      Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.  A few countries are beginning to discuss
      partial privatization of the entire government-owned entity, rather
      than spinning off G-T-D and undergoing separate privatization.


      Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put
      pressure on prices, due to sustained droughts, especially in East
      Africa.   Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing
      restructuring agendas in different countries.


      A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the
      schemes for regional transmission links.   The Mozambique
      Transmission Company links South Africa, Mozambique, and Swaziland;
      the West African Power Pool will link 16 countries; there is a
      Six-Country link underway between Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and
      Turkey, and later Lebanon.


           ?  Algeria: Interior minister Khelil, who as a World Bank
              official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in
              several countries, is committed to "a profound restructuring
              of Sonatrach (the NOC) and the power sector (Sonelgaz)."
              Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle
              G-T-D, end Sonelgaz' generation monopoly, and allow for IPPs
              on a B-O-T basis. Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic
              consumption, and some for export.  Algeria is keenly
              interested in sending power to deregulating European markets
              via a new undersea link to Spain.

           ?  Ghana:  With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River,
              98% of Ghana's current power needs are supplied by
              hydroelectricity. Ghana's planned privatization of its
              distribution company into 4-5 regional companies is possible
              in 2001.  It is implementing a series of power sector reforms
              designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to
              electricity and to transform Ghana into a middle-income
              country within one generation.  It is moving to reduce its
              reliance on hydro-power by allowing IPPs to build deisel,
              gas, and light crude plants.  Regionally, Ghana is committed
              to building a West African Power Pool (WAPP) by expanding
              electricity generation and interconnections.

           ?  Morocco:  Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded
              for Tangiers and Tetouan.  The concession covers the
              provision of water, sewerage, and electrical services to
              these two northern areas. Two earlier power/water concessions
              (Casablanca, Rabat) were awarded.  Morocco has an active IPP
              program; one of the plants was even transferred to the
              builders after its completion.  No sale of transmission
              assets is planned.

           ?  Nigeria: The IMF has provided Nigeria a $1billion facility to
              encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo.
              In November, the government announced plans to privatize

              ailing NEPA, the SOU. While a draft electricity policy has
              been prepared, no details have emerged.  They intend to send
              regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of
              December, which should include a framework for foreign IPP
              investors.  It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up,
              prior to privatization. Enron is supplying 270MW via 9
              barge-mounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power
              shortages in this oil-rich country.

           ?  Senegal: Showing how risky foreign investment remains, the
              new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qu,bec and Elyo to
              leave, less than two years after they won a 34% interest in
              state EU S,n,lec.  The current government, while
              acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants,
              cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors.

           ?  South Africa: Eskom, South Africa's parastatal, generates 95%
              of the country's power, and transmits it over national lines
              to municipal distributors.  South Africa is moving slowly
              towards restructuring and unbundling of G-T-D.  The
              fragmented distribution system will be merged into six
              discos, while plants may be grouped into gencos. Last year,
              G-T-D activities were "ring-fenced" to evaluate costs for
              each business.  A new structure for the electricity supply
              industry is being discussed, and the possibility of
              privatizing 30% of Eskom's power stations has been raised for
              the first time. Electricity regulators announced in November
              that they were considering three bids for the first IPP
              license, to be offered next year. While South Africa needs
              new generation capacity by 2004, it now exports power to its
              neighbors, and is very active in the creation of a regional
              transmission network.  Eskom has ambitions to be a global
              player, while continuing to focus on its development agenda
              of rural electrification.  Eskom Enterprises, the unregulated
              business subsidiary, is considering an IPO.

           ?  Egypt: In July, the Egyptian Electricity Authority was
              converted into a holding company, although still state-owned.
              It intends to offer 49% stakes in seven or eight regional G&D
              companies.  The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity, valued at
              $2.1 billion, will be first, although it has been twice
              postponed.  All capacity additions will be solicited
              competitively as IPPs under the BOOT (build- own- operate-
              transfer) model. This allows developers to recover
              construction costs by running a plant, while the state
              eventually owns the project without affecting its debt
              profile.   Egypt is part of a planned Six-Country
              transmission link.

           ?  Israel: Israel has been discussing restructuring and
              privatization for a few years now, but no real progress has
              been made. An electricity law passed in March '96 extended
              the Israel Electric Company (IEC) license for 10 years in
              exchange for its accepting 10% of it power needs (900MW) from
              IPPs, and another 10% from foreign developers. So far, only
              one IPP has been built.  Recent offshore gas discoveries have
              been largely in Palestinian waters; further exploration will
              be necessary before Israel, which has no indigenous fuel
              sources, knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply.

           ?  Jordan: With virtually no indigenous oil or gas, Jordan has
              been highly dependent on Iraqi oil.  In early '98, NEPCO, the
              state utility, was corporatized, and G-T-D was unbundled.
              Jordan's first solicited IPP (450MW) was awarded to Tractebel
              in May.  There is talk of relying on IPPs for further
              generation and of privatizing existing assets.  Consultants
              were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution
              privatization.  Jordan's transmission grid was linked to
              Egypt in '98; the link to Syria should be completed soon.

           ?  Kuwait: Lifting a freeze on large projects, the cabinet has
              allowed two new IPPs (1000MW, 2500MW) with possible private
              financing options.  Forcasts for power show 5500 new MW
              needed in the next 15 years.

           ?  Lebanon:  After years of war, Lebanon is now engaged in
              massively rebuilding its infrastructure.  In April,
              consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on
              restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector.
              Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned Six-Country
              regional transmission linkup.

           ?  Palestine:   The outlook for Palestine's energy independence
              changed in a moment this Autumn, with offshore gas fields in
              acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial.  It has
              been nearly totally dependent on Israel's IEC for power.

           ?  Qatar: Officials announced in February that they had invited
              five companies to submit proposals for an IPP.  Foreign
              developers would hold a 60% stake in a plant envisioned to
              begin at 200MW, rising later to 1100MW.  A decision would
              turn on a bid of less than 5.5 cents/kWh to generate power.
              Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs.

           ?  Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia's 5% demand growth has created a
              need for an additional 50GW of capacity by 2020, much of
              which will need to come from the private sector.
              Privatization of the sector is being considered, as is an
              unbundling of G-T-D.  As a first step, in February, the ten
              power companies were merged.  In April, the Saudi Electricity
              Company was created as a joint-stock company, 50%
              government-owned.  The consensus among potential investors is
              that much needs to be done on the regulatory system, the
              financial framework, and on tariffs before IPPs become
              feasible.  For instance, nationals pay only nominal amounts
              for power.  Early considerations of BOT projects to meet
              soaring demand were shelved.

           ?  Tunisia: The Parliament passed enabling legislation for
              independent power in April '96.  While the government will
              continue to control D-T and international trade, all new
              generation will be open to the private sector.  The first
              IPP, for 471MW, is scheduled to come online in 2001.  It will
              produce 20-25% of Tunisia's electricity.

           ?  United Arab Emirates: The UAE is a confederation of 7
              Emirates.  Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi; it
              and Dubai provide over 80% of UAE income.  In '98, the UAE
              called for comprehensive restructuring of the power/water
              authority, and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE
              nationals.  While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still
              anticipated, Dubai has decided not to privatize these
              sectors.  Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai, as
              both BOO and BOOT. The UAE's need for additional power may be
              met by a grid linking several Gulf States' systems, which is
              under discussion between the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
              Kuwait, and Bahrain.

I have some questions myself about the data contained below, but it is 
largely accurate, and for those of you following Europe from afar, I thought 
this summary was a convenient way to share with you the status of 
developments in Europe.   call if you have any questions.   mcs

Subject: Country and EU liberalisation summaries

All

Given the number of requests that we have for country summaries, Sadia has 
put together these two files.  The first of these files contains for each 
country of the EU, for power and gas, a description of each country's 
deregulation, and current issues.  I think we will update this every month or 
so.

The second file contains some EU wide stuff - maps of liberalisation, the 
flags showing liberalisation etc.

Let me know if you need anything else - our next step is to add reported 
price data.  These are also on the s:\ees\risk mgt\presentations shared space

Enjoy.

Thought you should see this announcement immediately. Paul is not happy with 
terms Ruhrgas has offered (inc. tariff) but Ulf Boege (President of Cartel 
Office, interestingly described by Bloomberg as the "regulator"!) seemed to 
be in a hurry to break the "good news" to the markets.

Subject: Bullets for Kean Presentation


Here's an attempt at some key "lessons" from CA to the UK (or vice versa as 
the case may be).  Actually they are more themes/differences/comments coming 
out of the CA experience, which will need tailoring/trimming down to fit the 
context of the actual presentation.  As I've indicated, depending on the 
point being presented, there may be a need for some caution in using the 
examples in too simplistic a context.

? Barriers to generator entry.
? Apart from the moratorium, it has been relatively easy to gain consent to 
construct new generation in the UK.  This is clearly a good thing in itself, 
but there are some potential pitfalls in just asserting this.  The entry has 
been criticised as unecessary in a market with significant overcapacity 
(indeed this was one of the justifications for the moratorium) and had 
surprisingly little impact on price for at least the first 8 years of the 
Pool. Indeed prices only fell once NP/PG divested plant.  Hence it would be 
easy to retort that new capacity was not required in the UK, the entry that 
did occur was wasteful and that the CA analogy is bogus (although clearly the 
full story is more complex than this)
? Moratorium had a significant impact on investment and stalled competition.  
(True, but difficult to sustain given that divestment and pre-committed new 
entry ensured that prices fell significantly before the moratorium was 
lifted.)
? Danger that measures designed to meet the CHP and Renewables targets 
constrain future developments and lead to capacity shortages, ie, perfection 
should not be the enemy of the good.  This is not the case currently.  
However, new applications must demonstrate that CHP has been fully explored - 
if this hurdle acquires real teeth (or turns into something more formal) then 
we could see easy consents getting significantly more difficult.  This is, 
however, largely speculation at the current time.

? Retail caps
? Purchase costs could be passed through in UK (for at least the first 8 
years).  Although some purchase costs were pseudo-regulated (through the 
vesting contracts and their replacements),  the Public Electricity Suppliers 
also purchased power from CCGTs in which they also took equity at very high 
prices.  (Teesside was one of the first examples of this.) The cost of this 
was passed through to franchise customers.  This was widely criticised and 
although the regulator allowed this to happen (on the grounds of entry 
promoting competition), the fact that all the entry was baseload and NP/PG 
still controlled the marginal plant meant that wholesale market prices didn't 
change at all.
? Since 1998, prices caps have been instituted and have not been a problem.  
Although the caps squeezed the PES margins, they could contract forward to 
hedge the risk of wholesale price movements.  Morever, the price caps have 
actually reduce wholelsale prices - generator market power meant that the 
wholesale price was, in part, a net-back from the allowed retail tariff.
? Watch out for Independent Energy, a supplier who did go bankrupt.  This was 
due to a combination of being under-hedged when power prices rose and not 
having adequate infrastructure to bill customers and get the cash in.

? Competition
? Generator concentration meant excessive prices for the first 8-9 years of 
the Pool.  Restructuring and divestment was essential to realising the 
benefits of competition.
? Retail competition has been very successful and has been a key driver in 
increasing liquidity in the wholesale market


? Stranded Costs
? Stranded cost recovery largely didn't distort the market, eg, nuclear levy, 
vesting contracts did not affect marginal decisions.  (That said market power 
provided a very soft landing and the market was clearly stitched up to meet 
the needs of the miners for years.)

Hope these help.  Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

Paul

Subject: URE Statement on Criteria for Lifting Tariff Approval Requirements

The President of the Regulatory Authority has recently issued a 3-page=20
statement, outlining the criteria he will take into account in assessing=20
whether to release companies (ie, generators and trading companies) from th=
e=20
tariff approval requirements in the Polish Energy Law.  We may arrive at a=

situation later this year where we have signed the necessary transmission,=
=20
balancing and settlement contract(s) with PSE so that we can do wholesale=
=20
trades -but are still subject to the requirement to get our trades (sales,=
=20
not purchases) "approved" by URE before we can conclude them. =20

The URE statement and recent press comments by the regulator do not give us=
=20
any grounds to believe that traders such as Enron are going to be released=
=20
soon from this requirement (in the press he has talked about possibly=20
releasing some generators from the requirement in early 2001).  We may=20
therefore need to investigate getting an "approved tariff".  However, unles=
s=20
we can get a framework agreement in place (so we don't need to get each and=

solution.

The attached statement is unhelpful in that it appears to be simply a list =

the issues raised are genuine concerns, it does not of course follow that=

t=20
response.  (In October 1999 we presented to URE the reasons why we believe=

that these requirements make no sense for a new entrant supplier such as=20
Enron.) =20

However, since this issue is unlikely to go away, Jarek D. and I plan to us=

this statement to develop a dialogue with URE and see if we can find a=20

Doug - greetings.  It has been quite some time since I I last saw you when I 
worked for Baker & Botts, on behalf of Houston Lighting & Power with Randy 
McManus.  I head up Enron's Government and regulatory Affaris Department for 
Europe, and Steve has asked me to respond to your request below.  I am afraid 
it is a bit grim.  You will definitely not find any boutiques in this field, 
rather for the most part lawyers who have done transactional work at big 
firms, or competition law at big firms, who understand something about the 
industry, but almost nothing about regulation or third-party access issues.  
Having said that, here is a list of firms we use, or that I can recommend:

In the UK, we use Slaughters & May.  You can also find some talent at Allen & 
Overy, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, and Herbert Smith (we do not use them, 
due to some conflicts) but all are so transaction-focussed (big fees), that 
non-transactionwork is less appealing.

In Brussels (EU), we use Linklaters, with some mixed success, we have also 
used Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering on one merger case (we opposed) so they got 
some learning on Third-party access issues (if that is indeed your interest) 
at our time and expense.  I cannot recall the name of the lawyer, but can 
find if you want me to.  I understand that Cleary, gottlieb has a good 
competition law practice, but most such practices are on the merging parties' 
side, and few are experieinced or good at advocating remedies along the lines 
you would expect Enron to be seeking. 

Elsewhere in Europe, you were not specific as to country (you will fnd the UK 
firms very much out of their depth elsewhere in Europe, as they all seem to 
suffer from the experience of the UK market opening, in which it was all laid 
out in detail in advance; the ad hoc nature of European liberalisation throws 
them off of their stride, unless they have a local affiliate, and even they 
do not typically understand the objectives that, at least we at Enron, are 
seeking with unbundling, third-party access, etc.) Here are a  few, though:

Germany - the Vessing firm (good litigators, we do not use them though); 
Clifford Chance Punder Vollhard (a merged firm), we use, but very expensive, 
and in my view still do not quite get it all; Oppenhoff Radler (a Linklaters 
affiliate) seems good (we are using them more often); if you know David Bloom 
at Mayer, Brwon & Platt in Wash. DC, we use his firm in Cologne (thin staff, 
but understand what we are trying to achiev, good on energy and tellecomms).

The Netherlands - Clifford Chance; Loeff Clays; and a firm with the name 
Kennedy in it (sorry for spotty details)(they have an academic associated 
with them, Leigh Hancher, a woman, who is quite good).

Denmark - Kromann and Munter

Norway and Sweden we have good firms, names elude me, but I can obtain if 
needed.  In Sweden, we use the Vinge firm, and they have offices all around 
Nordic market, though we do not use them besides Sweden.

Belgium, Loeff Clays (though my experience is that, even though they are 
among the best in Belgium and The Netherlands, they are not strong).

France - the Slaugher and May office in Paris; or Cleary, Gottlieb.

Spain - Uria, Menendez

We have firms we use in Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and points East, not all 
of which I can recall, but again, I can provide if you need.

I suggest a lot of time is spent to make sure they understand your problem.  
Any new business model (e.g., Enron) takes them some time to understand, and 
if they do not understand, it can be costly and time-consuming.  Good luck 
and let me know if you need more.   Mark Schroeder

Rosalee - would you please pass along the short note below to Ken?   thanks  
Mark

Ken - just an update on our German Federal Cartel Office proceeding, after 
your conversation with Ulf Boge.  Our case has not yet been dismissed, and 
yesterday, took a turn for the better.  One of the two utilities, GVS, who 
had refused to shoulder their share of the cost of the economic study that 
was to produce a fair rate, has now agreed to pay their share, and it appears 
that the study will go forward, so we may still get the precedent we are 
looking for.  Apparently, they (GVS) may not have wished to be put in the 
position of being the "poster child" for why Negotiated Third Party Access 
does not work.  I will keep you updated on any further developments.  Thank 
you again for your intervention with Boge.  With the way things work in 
Germany, it would not be at all surprising, if after your conversation with 
Boge, the word got back to GVS that Enron's management at the highest level 
was focussing on this case, and that it should not be seen as a failure of 
the Cartel Office.  Mark Schroeder

Steve - FYI, as discussed lst week, here is the statement we are issuing on 
the so-called acceleration directives being considered in Stockholm this 
week.  I suggested using Ken/Jeff/john Sherriff as the quoted, laudatory 
official in the company, but the view seems to be that if we quote them, they 
have to be up to speed to respond to other press inquiries, i.e., subsequent 
inquiries cannot be deflected to more junior people like Peter or me.  Any 
way, both an explanation of why we did not use Ken or Jeff, and fyi, what we 
actually said is contained in the attached.   let me know if you have 
questions or need more.  mcs

Brussels correspondents Peter spoke to (or established a relationship with) 
in the last few months re European energy liberalisation including Patrick 
Cox of Bloomberg (today), Philip Shiskin from the WSJ last Monday and Daniel 
Dombey from the FT last week.  Peter covered most of these points already 
today in his Bloomberg interview (France and Germany in particular were not 
really touched upon).

We will also use it on a reactive basis for when correspondents contact you 
there in Brussels, us here in London, C&W in Frankfurt and GK in Oslo. Please 
let us know any enquiries you might receive before sending out the statement.

Many thanks

Subject: Belgium: Electricity and gas markets: recent amendments

On 24 October 2000, six Royal Decrees on the liberalisation of the energy=

(electricity and gas) market were published in the Official Gazette. Below =

Electricity matters:=20

Distribution companies are elegible, for the volume of electricity supplied=

to eligible clients within the distribution grid=20
Registration requirements:
Elegible customers must provide the competent minister with all relevant=20
information, such as the meter reading recording the supply of electricity=
=20
over the previous year, and an evaluation of consumption in the next year.
For 2000,customers must register by 23/11/00, these customers will be=20
elegible through 12/31/01
For all comming years, including 2001, customers must register by the 1st o=

Febuary of that year
Resistration must be renewed every year. (An official registration form is=

publish and will be available soon)=20
=20
Management of the transmission grid
At least half the Board of Directors must be independent directors;
The Board of Directors constitutes a governance committee composed only of=
=20
independent directors.  This committee=01,s object is to:
propose candidates for appointments as independent directors; and
examine conflicts of interest between the system operator and any of its=20
shareholders and report to the Board of Directors; and
rule on cases of conflicts of interest (managers and personnel); and
supervise the proper application of the Royal Decree.

The Management Board, constituted of independent members, is exclusively=20
competent for the technical operation of the network. =20

However, the system operator has yet to be appointed. The Council of=20
Ministers may make this appointment in the next few weeks (maybe on 10=20
November 2000).  The  guarantee to the right of access for the eligible=20
customers, is not yet in force and shall come into force only once the=20
appointment of the system operator is official.

Composition and functioning of the General Council of the CREG
The General Council of the CREG gives advice and recommendations on the=20
electricity and gas market at the request of the competent Minister, a=20
regional government or the executive body of the CREG.
The composition of the General Council has been amended to e.g. increase th=
e=20
representation of public authorities, and allow producers of renewable ener=
gy=20
to be represented.

2.    Gas Matters
A large part of the Act of 29 April 1999 on liberalising the gas market is=
=20
now in force.  However, most provisions now in force only empower the King =
or=20
the competent Minister to issue (Royal) Decrees to implement the Gas Act.

Three provisions, in force since 24 October, may be singled out:

Electricity producers may buy the gas necessary to generate electricity,=20
whatever their consumption.  However, the right of access to the network is=
=20
not yet in force (same problem as for the electricity market).

Conflicts on access to the gas network may be submitted to the GREG, which=

has powers of conciliation and arbitration. An administrative court ("La=20
chambre d'Appel") will also be created to rule on this kind of conflict.  A=

Royal Decree regulating arbitration and the procedure in the administrative=

court still has to be issued.

>From the first financial year after 10 August 2000, Belgian companies that=

Steve - when you get a chance, please take time to read David Merrill's 
status report below.  Frankly, I think he is trying his best to get on top of 
the EBS tasks we have given him.

HOWEVER, having said that, and before having received his report below, I was 
going to write you an e-mail indicating that I am afraid we cannot continue 
to keep David in this role.  I just returned from Tokyo (office opening,  
meetings, etc.).  There, I saw Sanjay, who confirmed his imminent new role 
for EBS Asia, Anthony Duenner (President, EBS Asia), and Bill White, head of 
EBS Asia Trading.  David simply does not enjoy the confidence of his 
commercial clients in EBS, and, notwithstanding my comments above about the 
level of his effort, I do not see turning this around.  His problem is not 
any single one thing, but a cumulation of things, which I list below, but I 
think it is the totality that feeds the general view:

1)  He was probably only a decent fit with the old Enron APACHI, when it was 
asset-focussed, and he could use his diplomatic experience to open doors for 
projects.  Even then, he was never an "Enron" person, in terms of our 
culture, and being isolated in Singapore has probably not helped to get him 
inculcated in the company culture.  With EBS and Enron Asia taking a much 
more "merchant" business focus, he just does not get it.

2)  Chris Hunt (APACHI), and Jim Row (ex-EBS) encoureaged him to 
develop/pursue origination leads.  EBS does not want him doing that, and the 
asset-focussed stuff he keeps tossing the way of the enrgy groups is grating 
to them, given that they simply see him as not getting the message that the 
company has moved away from  assets.

3)  Bill White tells me that he (David) has not performed well in a meeting.  
It is a single data point, but Bill is also known to me from Enron Europe 
days, and he is not a particularly critical person.

4)  David only exacerbates this by being insecure about his role, and trying 
too hard to sell himself to the clients/customers internally, and they find 
this teidous.

5)  Frankly, though it is not the only source of David's problems, I think he 
was ill-served by Donald Lassere and XiXi (the associate), who I am confident 
conducted what is know here as a "whispering campaign", i.e., "he does not 
know what he is doing", "he is not an expert in the filed", and generally 
acting like a pair of juveniles when it has come to any effort to bring a 
sense of stability and order to the clients, e.g., "don't know what I am 
supposed to be doing". 

In any event, I simply do not see much prospect of persuading the EBS people 
to give David a chance, and I think I will be doing myself no favours with 
them by pushing it.  SO, either we find another role, e.g., in in Washington, 
and I am nor sure they need someone with David's skill sets, or we let David 
go.  Your thoughts?

In terms of supporting EBS Asia, I think the new guy I hired here in London 
could do it quite capably, but all of the biz is either in Houston, or I am 
told Sanjay is contemplating a move to Singapore, so, in eitheerr case, my 
guy here can probably not be effective from the standpoint of being read into 
the business.  From where I am, I would prefer to have someone in Singapore 
or Tokyo, rather than Houston, but the people in Houston may want someone 
closer to them (I frankly think it is a mistake to try to build a business in 
Asia from Houston).  Sanjay mentioned the guy who is his General Counsel at 
Dabhol Power Company, and I will discretely check with Jane Wilson on her 
impressions (but he will not be "communications" literate/specialised).  

Look forward to your ideas.   mcs

Subject: Status Report

Mark:  Here is a status report: 

I  met with Anthony Duenner Friday in Korea.   He approved expenses from
his budget for (1) some of the consulting work in Hong Kong that needs to be 
done, 
(2)  Korean work with a law firm to see if we can get a new decision on 
bandwidth
trading,  (3) continuing expenses of the present tariff consultant in 
Japan.   I have
done separate e-mails on (1) and (2), copied to you.   So that concern is 
taken care of. 

Everything seems to be going very well so far in the new assignment.   Thanks 
for
giving me the lead.     Here is country by country status:

Korea:    I went up the learning curve a lot on the Korea trip (see sep 
e-mail on the 
regulatory problem we discovered and proposed strategy to deal with it).   I 
now feel 
very much on top of Korea.   Will go back to advance the work on overturning 
the
adverse regulatory ruling.   To my mind this is exactly what a regulatory 
review should
do - - identify regulatory risks before we go in.

Hong Kong:   We have identified somebody in EBS to do the system 
configuration report. 
I am going to go up there to advance the tariff submission that is due before 
year end.

Japan:   I need to get up there and get up to speed on what the consultant is 
doing on tariff and
terms and conditions.

Singapore:  I am reminding the lawyers to get a corporate entity selected so 
we can 
proceed with a license and tax incentive application.  

Taiwan:   I will be doing a Taiwan regulatory review similar to Korea but 
lower priority.  
Will probably be January.   Also was approved by Duenner.   Never did find 
out what his
people did there, but I will.  

David

The stricter consents policy (moratorium) on gas-fired generation has been 
lifted, per this announcement.  It also six stations have been approved (they

I am quite sure that our project (Kent Power/Isle of Grain) will be

I will assume that you can retrieve e-mail by now.  Below is a recent 
development, as you have asked to be kept apprised.  It is the draft, still 
subject to comment, on how to allocate transmission import capacity into 
Italy for 2001.  Important, as it is our main (nearly only) source of 
physical power to satisfy deals we have originated.  What appears below is 
Alfredo's summary.  Recognise that English is not his first language 
(probably his fourth), so it is a bit difficult to follow first time 
through.   mcs

Subject: New import capacity rules in Italy


The new delibera by the Authority outlines the methodology for the allocation 
of import capacity in 2001. Full details should be necessarily developed in 
full by the TSO by 30 Sept 2000. Find below, an apetizer for tomorrow's 
conference call.

Main features

1. The Delibera asks the TSO to reach a compromise with neighbouring TSOs in 
order to render the allocation "firm" and "deep", that is, to ensure that  
agents who obtain import capacity into Italy receive a transparent and 
non-discriminatory treatment by these foreign TSOs. In case of disagreement, 
the  Italian TSO will proceed autonomously with its own allocation (which is 
the current status).

3. Allocation procedure: iterative auction. Clearing price "seems" to be 
Pay-As-You-Bid, but the drafting is not conclusive.

4. No Letter of Credit or Declaration of Neighbouring TSOs, or Supply 
Contract with end-customer required to agents participating in the auction. 
This has  been replaced by  a Letter of Intention per consumption point 
(which expresses interest for the capacity requested).  

5. 80 (20) percent of ATC for 2001 to be allocated annually (monthly). Bids 
before 30 Sept 2000 (90 days before the start of each month). Bidding block 
is 10  MW, at non-decreasing prices.

6. Antitrust thresholds: 20 percent of ATC per border and per agent, 10 
percent of total ATC per agent. The thresholds are applicable both to the 
amount  requested, and/or the amount allocated. 

Main concerns

1. Any substantial progress with respect to the 2000 situation depends on the 
ability of the Italian TSOs to fulfill its mandate of reaching a 
co-ordinated   allocation with neighbouring TSOs. The Delibera does not 
provide any idea on how the Italian TSO may exercise its leverage to find a 
successful solution  (eg, making co-ordination more profitable for foreign 
TSOs? Curtailing the level of import capacity in case of disagreement such 
that foreign TSOs wheel  less volumes/possibly make less money? Is money the 
issue or perhaps, leaving us outside the game?)

2. The alternative in case of disagreement (that is, unilateral allocation of 
50 percent of the ATC) makes no sense. If there is not an agreement (as it   
happened in 2000), allocating only 50 percent unilaterally does not solve 
anything. Actually, it could make things worse by removing some pressure by  
agents who got allocated 100 percent of the capacity on the Italian side, 
over foreign TSOs (as happened this year). As drafted, the Delibera makes 
the  Italian TSO to accept whatever allocation the foreign TSOs decide for 
their 50 percent, without requesting a reciprocal treatment for the 50 
percent capacity  allocated by the Italian TSO!!! This could have been an 
interesting "carrot" for the Swiss if properly articulated.

3. The details of the auction procedure contain several loopholes and 
inconsistencies. Some clarification will be needed by the Autorita, and we 
will need to  send asap a list of all unclear definitions. 

4. Only one letter of intention as in 4 above per consumption point. This 
means the consumer gets tied up with a single supplier before the allocation 
takes  place.

5. Spot purchases by TSO still opaque. In some circumstances, this is being 
favourable to us, so let's consider if we want to say anything here.

6. Lack of any reference to secondary trading of capacity. Not prohibited, 
but not proposed or explicitly outlined.

7. The "Pay-as-you-Bid" criteria makes less attractive Paul/Marco's proposed 
deal structure with ELES for sales into Italy.

More tomorrow,

a.

Subject:  Background Information France Electricity



Background

The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate=
d=20
monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n=
ow=20
have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20
emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=
=20
risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=
=20
proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=
0%=20
tolerance level or 5MW.=20

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=
he=20
availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=
=20
balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=
=20
effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=
=20
blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=
l=20
transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=
=20
of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=
=20
the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20
Resources Limited ("ECTRL") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=
=20
closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=
he=20
very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20

Future Developments

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20
trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=
=20
with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=
=20
over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=
=20
release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=
=20
the further development of the market.

Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=
=20
(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=
=20
balancing market will also show referenced market prices for balancing=20
services.
=20
Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=
=20
However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met.=20

Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=
al=20
capacity through VPP auctions starting in September 2001, representing abou=
t=20
30% of the market for French eligible industrials This will further=20
contribute to increase liquidity.=20

Regulatory Environment

The goal of Directive 96/92/EC concerning the internal market in electricit=
y=20
is to obtain a cheaper but secure electricity supply by introducing and=20
gradually expanding competition while maintaining industry competitiveness =
in=20
the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=
=20
certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=
l=20
of liberalisation still exist.=20

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=
an=20
required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=
ss=20
(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20
transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20
current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=
ar=20
and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20
Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=
=20
consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=
r=20
market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20
direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=
nt=20
declined a quicker opening of the power market.

The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=
on=20
de Regulation de l'Electricit,) is the official regulatory body and the=20
ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=
r=20
non-discriminatory access on to the grid and will be issuing transportation=
=20
tariffs.  The Ministry is responsible for providing generation licenses for=
=20
IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20

RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=
=20
Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20
allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=
=20
levied at the margin, which favours long-term contracts and historical=20
players. In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with=20
regards to RTE real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports an=
d=20
imports. However an intra-day market is now effective for transits, imports=
=20
and exports.  The first come first serve allocation rule on border capacity=
=20
is likely to be changed by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is likely to=20
request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision =
of=20
the Ministry of Industry, the main route for authorisation. Authorised IPPs=
=20
in France are limited by Decree to buying for resale to eligible customers =
a=20
maximum of buy for resale to eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% =
of=20
the installed capacity, including long term contracts. Although the=20
interpretation of this law is unclear, a recent statement by M. Tuot,=20
Director General of the CRE, implies that these restrictions only apply to=
=20
French authorised producers and thus not to foreign-based energy companies =
or=20
other non-producing entities. Thus, these restrictions do not apply to ECTR=
L,=20
as we are not registered in France.  In addition, French IPPs are free to=
=20
sell and export their production.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a balancing responsibility contract=
=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are free of transmission=
=20
charges. =20

A network code is currently under discussion between market players and=20
RTE.      =20

Market Conventions

A range of wholesale electricity products are currently traded in France. =
=20
Peak and baseload day-ahead, week-ahead, monthly, quaterly, and yearly=20
products are traded.  Peak products follow the German convention (12 hour=

Gate closure for scheduling imports, exports and transits is 14h00 Paris=20

Other: The Gas Market

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted for mid 2002), and it i=
s=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was published on 13 July 2000 by=20
GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to be=
=20
developed for 2003. Charges for imbalances are expensive and access to=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=

The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=

Updated May 2001.

1)Background

France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.=
=20
EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th=
e=20
world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20
historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power =
in=20
Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the=
=20
French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20
nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation=
=20
represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.=
=20

A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such=
=20
as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell=
=20
their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan=
t=20
development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20
installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe=
r=20
generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is "preferable" the=20
correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20
Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=
=20
apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.
More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession area.

2) Regulatory Environment

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20
regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=
he=20
law was approved one year late, failing to meet the required EU deadline.=
=20
Dozens  ["Dozens"  - I would replace this with "Several")  of application=
=20
decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=
=20
The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=
=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20
auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20
clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=
=20
per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20
French government declined a quicker opening of the power market.

Eligibility of distribution companies is limited to the eligible consumptio=
n=20
of customers located in their concession area. =20
A three-year framework contract ( e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three year contractual framework. =20

New IPPs have to be authorised through auctions or through direct decision=
=20
from the Ministry of Industry, which is the main route for authorisation.=
=20
Authorised IPPs in France are limited by Decree to trading buy for resale t=
o=20
eligible customers a volume equivalent to 20% of the installed capacity,=20
including long term contracts. Trading is currently defined as the conditio=
ns=20
of power purchase for resale to eligible customers. These Trading=20
restrictions, however, do not apply to ECTRL, as we are not registered in=
=20
France. IPPs are free to sell and export power.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EdF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff was implemented under the transitional=
=20
regime, which varies according to the voltage used,and which is based on a=
=20
matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/OffPeak). Users have to contract transmission u=
p=20
to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=
=20
available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=
=20
about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20
eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20
created programme responsible contracts (contrats de Responsable=20
d'Equilibre), which allow the aggregation of imbalance charges for differen=
t=20
eligible sites within an equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE.

Eligible customers, who are physically connected to the Grid, have to=20
contract for transmission vis-.-vis RTE (Contrat Made). Traders, such as=20
ECTRL, are not required to have such a transmission contract, as they do no=
t=20
consume the power they purchase. Only a programme responsible contract=20
coupled with grid access contracts (import, export, and/or transit) are=20
required by RTE. =20

A new Decree is expected to be passed by Summer 2001, setting up new=20
conditions for transmission, transits and exports under a permanent regime.=
=20
It is likely that this new tariff will implement a 1/3 injection-2/3 delive=
ry=20
calculation factor. Imports, which are allocated on a pro-rata basis, are=
=20
free of transmission charges. =20

Programme responsible contracts have established the basis of trading in=20
France through the exchange of blocs from one perimeter to another.  Enron=
=20
Capital & Trade Resources Limited ("ECTRL")  is programme responsible in=20
France. Cross border capacity is currently allocated on a first-come-first=
=20
served basis rule by RTE, and congestion fees are levied at the margin, whi=
ch=20
favours long term contracts and does not give equal treatment to all player=
s.=20
In addition, there is currently some lack of transparency with regards to R=
TE=20
real-time data on the capacity available/used for exports and imports. This=
=20
allocation rule is likely to change by end 2001. In addition, the CRE is=20
likely to request RTE to release additional data in the months to come.  =
=20

The CRE (Commission de Regulation de l'Electricite) is the offical regulato=
ry=20
body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20
eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20
      =20
3) Business Opportunity

Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=
y=20
to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through real-time=
=20
arbitrage between the flexibility of the industrial process, market prices=
=20
and optional structures. The establishment of programme responsible contrac=
ts=20
has created the basic conditions for an effective power trading market in=
=20
France. ECTRL closed the first physical power transaction in France early=
=20
2000, and was the very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in Franc=
e=20
late 2000. =20

An intraday market is now effective for transits, imports and exports, and =
is=20

4) Future Development=20

It is forecasted that both balancing market and spot exchange market will b=
e=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, which will be exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio=
=20
of contacts (producer,consumer), thus providing RTE with physical balancing=
=20
capacity. The balancing market will also show referenced market prices for=
=20
balancing services.=20

The Some of the spot market volume is expected to be run by ParisBourse.=20
However, due to the dominant position of EdF, the limited number of active=
=20
IPPs, existing restrictions for trading for authorised producers in France,=
=20
and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met. ECTRL has actively been lobbying in order to have fa=
ir=20
and transparent rules implemented for every player in the market and has=20
actively contributed for a spot market to take place.

However, thanks to an increasing number of players in France for trading,=
=20
imports, exports and transit, we are confident that the French power market=
=20
will develop rapidly.        =20

5) The Gas Market Situation

A transitional regime was implemented on 10 August 2000 by direct applicati=
on=20
of the EU Directive, thus establishing regulated TPA for sites whose=20
consumption is over 25 million cubic meters p.a. The eligibility threshold=
=20
will be reduced to 15million cubic meters in 2003, and 5 million cubic mete=
rs=20
in 2008. No gas law has been passed yet (forecasted mid 2002), and its is=
=20
expected that the transitional regime for gas in France will last until end=
=20
2002. A zonal/distance-related tariff was disclosed published on 13 July 20=
00=20
by GdF-Transportation. A permanent entry/exit tariff structure is likely to=
=20
be developed for 2003.  Charges  for imbalances are expensive, and access t=
o=20
storage is restricted. GdF-Trading, however, has published conditions for=
=20
balancing services.=20
There is only one trading Hub for France located at the French/Belgian bord=
er=20
(Blaregnies/TaisniSres). Due to the distance-related nature of the=20
transportation tariff, competitive TPA is limited to eligible sites which a=
re=20
located not too far (less than about 250Km) from the French/Belgian border.=
=20
The main imports into France are for high cal gas, and GdF has published th=
e=20
conditions for high cal/low cal gas swaps.
As there is not yet a  [new??] gas law in France ( a Projet de Loi was=20
approved on 17th May 2000) transposing the EU Gas Directive into domestic=
=20
legislation, the Regulatory Commission has not been appointed to-date , and=
=20
the official regulatory body remains the Ministry of Industry.   =20
Although current conditions do not facilitate full requirement supply to=20
customers from new entrants, it is already possible to optimise gas supply=
=20
through import of blocs for part or full supply. ECTRL was the first new=20
entrant to supply gas at the French border, and more recently into France.=

Bruno,

Quel surprise.  Should make your follow up with the MTF interesting as to t=

role of the Trustee.

One point to note for both MTF and Albers at COMP - the lack of within day=
=20
flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting developme=

of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand.  Suppliers will thus=

be at the mercy of EdF in the balancing market.

In addition, how on earth can they be allowed to take 2 years to complete t=

process?  How does that fit with merger remedy?

Somewhat ironic that they have the document in English!

Lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have spoken with MTF.

The UK has a new energy minister, Peter Hain.  As you will see from the 
Electricity Association (UK)'s brief below, he should be regarded as much 
greener, more interventionist, and populist than his predecessor, Helen 
Liddell.  Ralph Hodge, David Lewis, and I met with Peter Hain, when he was 
involved in Welsh development issues, to discuss our power project at Rassau 
in Wales, and found him very supportive of the UK government's stricter 
consents policy regarding gas-fired power generation, and not at all 
favourably disposed to projects of the size being proposed for Rassau, i.e., 
1200 MW (he asked why we could not make it much smaller).  Helen Liddell was 
scheduled to go to Washington DC in early February, and Hain may now be her 
replacement, in which case some of our US-based enron colleagues will have an 
opportunity to meet him.  let me know if you need more.   thanks  mcs

Depending upon your appetite for detail, in varying levels of detail, Peter 
and Nailia in our Brussels office have prepared the summaries below regarding 
the so-called "acceleration directives" of the European Commission, which are 
to be one of the subjects of the Stockholm Summit this week.  Given that 
these are significant milestones/events for our business, I wanted to pass 
this along should you be interested in more of the details.  mcs

Subject: Summary of the Commission's acceleration package!

Please see attached our summaries of the legislative package adopted by the 
European Commission on 13/03/01, which includes a proposal for a new 
Directive (so-called 'Acceleration Directive' , amending the existing 
Directives on internal market in electricity and gas) and a Regulation on 
cross-border trade in electricity. 

We have previously circulated summaries of the drafts of these two documents 
(as of February when the proposals were still in the phase of inter-service 
consulation within the Commission) which I am reattaching here for your 
convenience (Annexes 2 and 4).

 There have been some changes made to the text of the Directive since the 
February draft version and we have summarised most important of those in the 
new documents attached (Annex 1). Most of these changes we regard as 
positive. 

In particular:
the stipulation of ancillary services' definition to include flexible 
mechanisms such as load balancing and blending along with the storage 
services in gas and the requirement that the main commercial conditions for 
those are published has been requested by us during the meetings with the DG 
TREN officials in early March
we insisted on the obligation for an independent regulator to ensure 
cost-reflectivity of the transmission tariffs, which is now included in an 
expanded list of the regulator's responsibilities
our message that legal unbundling for is essential for distribution as well 
as for transmission has been channeled through a number of position papers 
which we have signed up to through various associations.  


Also, the Regulation on cross-border trade in electricity has been amended in 
a manner which enhances the clarity of drafting (see Annex 3). In particular, 
occasional references to 'individual transactions' which we thought were very 
unfortunate in the February draft (given that any transaction-related tariffs 
were forbidden) have been eliminated in the final text.  Also, a new Annex to 
the Regulation has been added. It basically endorses Florence conclusions on 
congestion management and allocation of capacity and is very good stuff 
overall.

Enron Europe's press statement endorsing the Commission's legislative 
initiative overall and highlighting key provisions of the adopted proposal 
was issued on 21/03/01. 

I will be presenting this proposal in more detail during our Government 
Affairs off-site next week and hope we can have a useful discussion as to the 
implications this legislation will have on our efforts in individual Member 
States.

Eric, Peter has also suggested that we may come to make a presentation to 
your group if you think this would be helpful.

While the conditions relating to approval of EdF's merger with EnBW are not 
strong enough for Enron (they never are!), I did want to call to your 
attention the concessions/remedies the European Commission Merger Task Force 
will require of EdF, which is SOLELY, in my view, attributable to the efforts 
of Enron, and in particular efforts lead by Peter Styles.  You will see below 
that EdF must make available, on a "virtual" (hence "VPP") basis capacity in 
some of its facilities (something I think they once accused us of "dreaming" 
about when we asked for it).  It may not make for a fully vibrant and 
competitive market, but it is a start which could not have been made without 
this effort.   let Peter or me know if you need more.   thanks  mcs

Subject: EdF/EnBW decision

Please see attached the Commission's press release (EN, FR and DE). We need 
to look into the full text of the decision (not yet available in the Official 
Journal) to judge any changes to the terms and conditions of VPP auction in 
reflection of our comments/criticism. 

So far the news are:

EdF makes available 6,000 MW (instead of 5,000!) to competitors, out of which 
5,000MW are released via VPP, 1,000 through PPAs. This is meant to constitute 
30% of eligible market.
This undertaking is limited to 5 years - subject to Commission's review upon 
expiration - possibility of prolongation if compet. market will not have 
evolved
EdF renounces its voting rights in CNR + withdrwa representatives in the 
Board of CNR + EdF won't be involved in CNR's commercial policy and market 
conduct (until we see detailed conditions difficult to judge whether any 
additional restrictions have been added since we saw the text of this 
undertaking alst time)
EnBW divests its shareholding in WATT (we have to see whether any 
ring-fencing conditions were added)


Let's discuss later.

Subject: Additional import/export authorisation

Please, find attached .tif file containing the authorisation to our new 
import/export requests:





As you could see in the attachment, the DGPEyM has made a mistake regarding 
the import authorisation from Portugal. It is not clear if number 9 above is 
50 MW or 200MW, or if 8+9 cannot be more than 200 MW. David is checking with 
the DGPEyM the reason for this.

David will be sending to DGPEyE and OMEL and REE the non-economic conditions 
of the transactions, using the same templates as in the past. 

Pedro, could you start contacting emilio cortes and ree to anticipate them 
the contents of the new authorisations?

Thanks, Mark. Of course in doing the Reuters telephone interview yesterday 
morning at Eva's request, for more than an hour, I made all of the critical/ 
explanatory points, and more, you mention below. The temptation of the quote 
from the Commission official was obviously irresistible for one of the 
journalists (Pomeroy) however. On the positive side, however, mention of 
traders' objections to level and incidence of the proposed tariff, its 
discriminatory effect, and absence of agreement about implementation in 
Germany are attributable to my briefing of the other journalist, Orgill.

The quoted official is giving the Dominique Ristori (a Commission Energy 
Policy Director of French nationality) party line, but our "victory" is 
attributable to decisions taken in the Cabinet of Loyola de Palacio, the 
Energy Commissioner, with whom I intervened on behalf of EFET two weeks ago, 
and who had already been confronted in September by British government 
objections. As such, it no longer matters objectively what M. Ristori and his 
spokespersons think about the "demise of the 2 euros". As you and I discussed 
yesterday, we must now move on rapidly to offer an alternative traders/ 
system users' solution for establishment of non discriminatory cross border 
transmission tariffs. An EFET paper for this purpose is already in 
preparation, and I spoke to the Cabinet of Mario Monti (Competition 
Commissioner) about the principles involved on Wednesday evening this week.

Relations has received some inquiries about "what is going on in Europe" 
yesterday, due to the bad headline Reuters chose below (aided by a 
self-serving European Commission official), and Dynegy's Q3 earnings showing 
red ink for Europe.  Ignoring the headline, and the quote from the European 
Commission civil servant (which I will elaborate upon below), this is a BIG 
WIN. It is progress for liberalisation, and I intend to tell The Economist 
just that when I do an interview with a reporter later today.  This story is 
about the DEMISE of the ill-conceived 2Euros/MWh export charge.  It stands 
truth and logic on its head to say, as the unnamed European official does, 
that the demise of the 2 euros charge was anything like "harmonisation" or 
that its demise sets back European liberalisattion.  It is now much more 
likely that we will get a charging regime that will maintain or increase 
trade, and certainly will not set back trade as the 2 euros would have.  Just 
to further de-construct the article, it was never a "single charge" (recall 
that new entrants disproportionately bore the burden, with many pre-existing 
contracts (of incumbents, since we did not exist in this market 3+ years ago) 
being exempt, nor would it contribute to a single market, but rather would 
have raised barriers to cross-border trade.  Moreover, the cost basis for the 
charge was never made transparent, either.  Finally, the rebate scheme likely 
would have subsidised the incumbents' competition against new entrants.  
There is a good quote from Peter Styles (and Peter deserves a great deal of 
recognition for leading the efforts to defeat this).  If you read the 
article, not the headline and European Commission official quote, you can see 
the other arguments against it, including the claim by German industrial 
consumers that it would have raised their prices by 10%.  Any message from PR 
or Investor Relations must be that this is a victory in the march towards a 
fully liberalised market, and a win for consumers.  The reason a European 
ommission official would say what they did is that they have been complicit 
in the German/Franco conspiracy to impose the 2 euros charge, and probably 
felt compelled to save face by saying this is a setback; otherwise, one would 
ask why were they working on/supporting something so deleterious to the 
development of the market?!

Apologies for being a bit lengthy, but I wrote this hopefully with sufficient 
detail that if you want to forward this to either PR or Investor Relations, 
they will be armed with enough info that they can respond to further 
inquiries.  By the way, we had an inkling of this via telephone coversation I 
had with UK DTI three days ago (communicated immediately to traders, just did 
not have time to summarise in an e-mail to you).  I will be summarising my 
conversation with UK DTI momentarily, even though it is 3 days old, because I 
will be adding some of her commentary on the wider political lay of the land, 
which I think you will want to read for the "big picture" of European 
machinations.  let me know if you need more.  thanks  mcs

UK:
EU plans for single power market suffer setback.
By Margaret Orgill

10/26/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Union hopes for a single electricity
market have suffered a setback after power companies and consumers failed to
agree a system for harmonising cross-border transmission tariffs, said
officials on Thursday.

Plans to introduce a single tariff for access to the west European grid by
November 1 have been postponed because of misgivings, particularly from some
power producers, said a European Union source.
"It seems that we have more problems than expected and the European Commission
could have to go for legislation," said the official, who declined to be
named.

The tariff is a voluntary proposal by western European grid operators to
harmonise cross border charges and create a single regional power market.

The official declined to give more details of the producers' doubts but
traders are opposed to the fee which they say is too high and will stifle the
emerging European power trading market.

The proposal has also run into legal problems in Germany where its
introduction would require changes to an industry agreement on access to the
regional electricity grid.

German consumer bodies are unlikely to accept the new tariff which will add
around 10 percent to wholesale power prices.

"The VIK, which represents industrial consumers, has already written to the
Commission saying they will not accept this fee," said Einar Vestra, managing
director of the trading division at Mannheim-based utility MVV.

TARIFF TO BE DISCUSSED BY EU, INDUSTRY

The tariff will be discussed by the so-called Florence group, which includes
EU officials, government and industry representatives, which is due to meet
again on November 9-10.

If the voluntary approach does not work, Brussels may decide to include
provisions on cross-border transmission in a forthcoming directive to speed up
the opening of Europe's electricity markets.

Grid operators have proposed a flat charge of two euros per megawatt hour for
exports regardless of how many borders the power crosses, instead of charging
a fee at each frontier.

The funds from the tariff will be put in a central pot and divided among grid
owners to reimburse network transit costs, estimated at around 200 million
euros a year.

Traders argue the fee is too expensive and object to the fact the grid
companies want to charge it only on new contracts and exempt existing
long-term contracts.

"An export-related transmission fee was misconceived in the first place," said
Peter Styles, vice president of European government affairs at U.S. utility
Enron.

"The priority in the Florence process should be greater harmonisation between
access regimes in member states...with a view of achieving transmission
tariffs which include cross border access."

Paul - I will ask you to take the lead in preparing a one or two page 
briefing paper for Steve in anticipation of his meeting with Energy Minister 
Hain.  Plus, throw in the bio.  Steve will obviously need to be aware of 
status of Isle of Grain, Rassau, Severnside, NETA, relevance (or lack 
thereof) of California to England and Wales model (on this last point, Anna 
Wlker has asked me to prepare two memos for DTI on i) US energy policy under 
Republicans, and ii) California situation, so the latter memo will be vetted 
by Washington DC office, and will subsume most of the substance of relevance 
of California to England and Wales).  We should note that Hain is 
anti-nuclear (though he now denies it), very green, and thus, we will want 
Steve to at least talk about our views on climate change (which will paint us 
as not hewing to the typical US line), and why lagre-scale CCGT is not a bad 
thing (this is probably most important area, and one that will probably 
require some explanation for Steve, so he understands the context (irrational 
as it is) in which Hain is likely to see these types of projects.   thanks

Steve, 

If you are available, the new UK Energy Minister Peter hain has asked to meet 
with Enron at 3pm on 6 February here in our DC offices.  If you or another 
senior Enron official cannot make it or do not want to make it, please let me 
know ASAP as I will scratch the date from his diary.  Schroeder thought it 
would be useful for you to do it.

POLAND:
Poland sets plan to end long-term power contracts.

10/27/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WARSAW, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A Polish government cabinet committee has approved
a scheme that will cancel long-term power contracts with compensation and
boost free trade in electricity, the government said on Friday.

Around 70 percent of Polish electricity, some 105-110 terawatt hours yearly,
is now sold under long-term contracts at fixed prices above market rates.
Their existence has effectively blocked market competition.
Under the programme, which still needs to be approved by the entire cabinet,
some 30 percent of the contracts are to be replaced by a compensation scheme
by the end of the year, while the entire wholesale market is to be free for
trade as of 2002.

The long-term energy contracts were signed with the Polish Power Grid (PSE) in
the early 1990s and were used by the biggest of Poland's 36 power generators
as collateral for modernisation loans received from commercial banks.

An inability to end long-term supply deals has delayed the creation of a
wholesale electricity market in which generators could compete for contracts
wih distributors and end consumers.

The government compensation scheme, which will allow for over-the-counter
trade in previously contracted power, should allow the market regulator URE to
free electricity prices.

The compensation, estimated at some 10-15 zlotys ($2.1-$3.2) per megawatt
hour, is to be paid by end users on the top of electricity bills.

But the price of electricity itself is expected to decrease as generators will
have to structure their prices on real supply costs.

The average end-user compensation fee is forecast to remain around 10-15
zlotys in real terms until the end of 2005, and then decrease to below five
zlotys or $1 per MWh by 2010.

The PSE will act as the system's administrator, breaking down the revenues
received from end users into supply costs and compensation to cover the
difference between previously contracted electricity prices and new lower
prices.

Rosalee - attached are some talking points prepared by our German gas 
origination team.  They would like to have these forwarded to Ken in Davos, 
where the person we would like Ken to speak with is also in attendance.  That 
is Mr. Ulf Boge, the President of the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) of 
Germany.  The FCO is about to dismiss a complaint we filed, on rather 
specious procedural grounds.  We regard this as an important case, and if Ken 
could have word with Boge about how important we regard this case, it would 
help.   thanks  mcs
