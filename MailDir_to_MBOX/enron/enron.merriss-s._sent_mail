I received the prospectus & roster just fine, and I'm looking forward to the 
climb, I'm glad that last person cancelled. I'll be calling around to 
possibly carpool also, I could either drive or catch a ride.
Thanks again,
          Steven Merriss

There are a few days/nights which I can hopefully not work. I don't want to 
work the night of 5/1, the night of 5/3, the day and night of 5/4, and the 
night of 5/17.
Thanks,
Steven

I just started in realtime a couple weeks ago and I need to be added to the 
Schedule Crawler list.

Thanks, Steven
