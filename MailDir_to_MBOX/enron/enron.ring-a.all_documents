I had Lee ann Chance reallocate the volumes for Louis Dreyfus and we still 
could not come up with the $ totals Louis Dreyfus invoiced us for. So I had 
Carla McLaughlin of Louis Dreyfus fax me the files they used to calculate 
their invoice on these deals. Please review the attached files and let me 
know if this is the way this deal should be calculated. Thank you.

Elizabeth,

           Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices 
Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have 
found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct 
and this is not a large amount in question.

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.

>
> Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat.
>
> Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even
> know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.
> However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few steps to
> lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact. The

>
> The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward

>
> Everyone started yelling, "Shay, run to first. Run to first." Never in his

>
> As Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him

>
> Shay ran home, stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero, for

>
> "That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,"the
> boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this

>
> And now, a footnote to the story. We all send thousands of jokes through
> e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages
> regarding life choices, people think twice about sharing.  The crude,
> vulgar, and sometimes the obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public
> discussion of decency is too often suppressed in school and the workplace.
> If you are thinking about forwarding this message, you are probably thinking
> about which people on your address list aren't the "appropriate" ones to
> receive this type of message.
>
> The person who sent this to you believes that we can all make a difference.
> We all have thousands of opportunities a day to help realize God's plan.  So
> many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a
> choice: Do we pass along a spark of the Divine?  Or do we pass up that

>
> You have two choices now:
>
> 1. Delete this.
>
> 2. Forward it to the people you care about.
>
> You know the choice I made.

I was told you may be the person to help me.   I am a trader on the East gas 
desk working for Scott Neal.  When I was originally set up to operate on EOL  
I  was set up with many more products than I needed.  I am having problems 
with my system being very slow and the suggestion was made to delete 
everything from All Products in stack manager but US Gas.  Are you the person 
who can help me accomplish this?  All other attempts to speed up the editing

Subject: Fwd: AND I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY !!




   One day when I was feeling gloomy, And in a melancholy mood, I heard a
  voice from out the gloom say 'Cheer up, things could be worse.'  So I
  cheered up and sure enough, things got worse!"
  
  THE NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY:
  
  Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out
  section of  forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The
  deceased
  male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
  back, flippers, and facemask.
  A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from
  massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive
  identification.
  Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver
  ended up in the middle of a forest fire.
  It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a
  diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from the forest. The fire
  fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in
  a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from
  the ocean and then flown to the forest fire and emptied.
  You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the
  Pacific, the next he was doing the breaststroke in a fire-dip-bucket 300
  feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10" of the fire.
  Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.
  (This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20,
  > 1998)
  STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?
  
  A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in
  the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
  accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handle
  bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
  motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.
  The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her
  husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next
  to him, and the shattered patio door.
  The wife ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance.
  Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the
  several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her
  husband.
  After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital,
  the wife up righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas
  was  spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the
  petrol, and threw the towels in the toilet. The man was treated and released
  to come home.
  Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the
  damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom,
  sat
  down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette,
  he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated.
  His wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her
  husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying
  on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering
  burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.
  His wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
  paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
  paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began   carrying
  him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
  accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
  husband had burned himself.
  She told them, and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of
  them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell
  down
  the remaining stairs and broke his arm.
  
  (Taken from a Florida Newspaper)
  
  Having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse.....
  
  A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
  frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
  the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
  she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
  his  arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to
  his Walkman!
  
     And finally.......
  Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
  bomb. It came back with "Return to Sender" stamped on it.  Forgetting it
  was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.
  Now, your day's not so bad, is it .........................? >>

This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

Subject: Fwd: Witch's Brew


  Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a 
   neighboring kingdom.  The monarch could have killed him, but was moved 
by 
   Arthur's youthful happiness. 
   So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult 
   question.  Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer;  if, after 
a 
   year, he still had no  answer, he would be killed. 
   The question was: "What do women really want?"  Such a question would 
   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed 
an 
   impossible query.  Since it was better than death, however, he accepted 
the 
   monarchs proposition to have an answer by year's end. 
   He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, 
the 
   prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester.  In all, he 
spoke 
   with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What 
most 
   people did tell him, was to consult the old witch, as only she would 
know 
   the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous 
throughout 
   the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. 
   The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to 
talk 
   to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept 
her 
   price first:  The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of 
the 
   Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! 
   Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had 
   only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises. He 
had 
   never run across such a repugnant creature.  He refused to force his 
friend 
   to marry her and have to endure such a burden. 
   Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.  He told him 
that 
   nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the 
   preservation of the Round  Table.  Hence, their wedding was 
   proclaimed, and the witch  answered Arthur's question:  "What a woman 
really 
   wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life." 
   Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and 
that 
   Arthur's life would be spared.  And so it went. 
   The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total 
freedom. 
 What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief 
and 
   anguish.  Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old 
witch 
   put her worst manners on display.  She ate with her hands, belched and 
passed 
   gas, and made everyone uncomfortable as ever. 
   The wedding night approached:  Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific 
   night, entered the bedroom.  What a sight awaited!  The most beautiful 
woman 
   he'd ever seen lay before him!  Gawain was astounded and asked what had 
   happened.  The beauty replied that since he  had been so kind to her 
(when 
   she was a witch), half the time she would  be her horrible, deformed 
self,and 
   the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self.  Which would he 
want 
   her to be during the day and which during the night? 
   What a cruel question!  Gawain began to think of his predicament: 
   during the day a beautiful woman to show off to  his friends, but at 
night, 
   in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch?  Or would he prefer 
having 
   by day  a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful  woman 
   to enjoy many intimate  moments? 

 What would you do? 

   What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read  until you've made your 
own 
   choice. 









   The Answer: * * 



   Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself. 

   Upon hearing this, she announced that she would  be beautiful all the 
time, 
   because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own 
life. 
   What is the moral of this story? 

   The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly, 
smart or 
   dumb. Underneath it all, she's still a witch.

>From Natural Gas Intelligence

Breaking News : Transco's Sundance Project Gets Green Light 
posted 10:11 AM (CST) Mar 28, 2001 

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's $134 million Sundance expansion project was 
approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today in a draft order 
issued at the Commission's regularly scheduled meeting. The looping and 
compression project will provide an additional 236,383 Dth/d of firm 
transportation capacity to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

About 38 miles of new pipeline along the company's existing mainline system 
will be installed along with modifications to existing compressor stations in 
Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, according to the project plans. The 
project will go in service in the spring of 2002.

Robust economic growth in the Southeast and development of significant new 
gas-fired power generation were the main forces driving the expansion. 
Southern Co. and Carolina Power and Light (CP&L) agreed to purchase most of 
the capacity of the project. Southern purchased 140,000 Dth/d. CP&L signed up 
for 75 MMcf/d. CP&L also is planning to build a $100 million, 82-mile 
intrastate lateral downstream of Sundance between Iredell and Richmond

Hi!

        Your not going to believe this but I just opened your email from a 
month ago.  Apparently I had so many at one time I thought I was seeing them 
all  but I wasn't.  It is (was) so good to hear from you!  I'm sorry about 
all the problems PG&E has had but I hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to 
much.  It will all work out in the end.  Dick & I are still here.  We were 
not smart and only sold about a third of our Enron stock when the price was 
above eighty so we have just been riding it down.  I guess we will be here 
for awhile.  I'm glad you got your house done - that is such a good feeling.  
We only have a few things left to do inside.  Then we get to start on the 
backyard and patio.  It never ends!  We had a very mild winter and it is just 
starting to get warm - I'm already dreading the heat.  I hope you can find a 
place to do ceramics.  I used to go with my mom every Saturday when I lived 
in Omaha.  At first I just went to spend time with her but I ended up really 
enjoying it - very relaxing.  I was very slow - in the year I was there I 
only finished two projects.  I still display them proudly on the appropriate 
holiday.  Are you going home for Easter?  This Friday I am going to have 
nasal surgery - something I have been putting off for years.  I am not 
looking forward to it.  Once again this highly predictable market is moving 
so I better go!  Take care and I'll try to call you when I get back from R&R .
Sorry it took so long to write!

I had Lee ann Chance reallocate the volumes for Louis Dreyfus and we still 
could not come up with the $ totals Louis Dreyfus invoiced us for. So I had 
Carla McLaughlin of Louis Dreyfus fax me the files they used to calculate 
their invoice on these deals. Please review the attached files and let me 
know if this is the way this deal should be calculated. Thank you.

Hi!

             I gave his resume to Scott Neal.  He is going to look at it and 
pass it on to the appropriate people.  It looks like his backround includes 
more origination experience than trading.  

                                                                            
Take care!

Hi!

              I know your probably mad at me but I took vacation on Friday 
and could not get my husband interested in coming downtown ( I know your 
thinking yeah right)!  Scott said it was fun!  Just because I didn't make 
your party does not mean you are out of sight  -  out of mind!  I wish you 
much happiness and a very bright future.  Take care and come to see us often 
(we are still waiting).

 ?IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND LIFE, JUST ASK THE KIDS 

A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, 3. The  
boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw  
the opportunity for a moral lesson. 
"If Jesus were sitting here, He would say, "Let my brother have the first  
pancake. I can ?wait." Kevin turned to his younger brother and said, "Ryan,  
you be Jesus. 

??????_________________ 


A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year-old son ran  
up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay  
dead in the sand. 
"Daddy, what happened to him?" the son asked. "He died and went to Heaven,"  
the dad replied. 
The boy thought a moment and then said, ?"Did God throw him back down?" 

???____________________ 

After the church service a little boy told the pastor, "When I grow up, I'm  
going to give you some money." "Well, thank you," the pastor replied, "but  
why?" "Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever  
had." 

?____________________ 


A wife invited some people to dinner. At the table, she turned to their  
six-year-old daughter and said, Would you like to say the blessing?" "I  
wouldn't know what to say," ?the girl replied. "Just say what you hear Mommy  
say," the wife answered. 
The daughter bowed her head and said, "Lord, why on earth did I invite all  
these people to dinner?" 

?____________________ 


A mother was teaching her three-year-old The Lord's Prayer. For several  
evenings at bedtime, the child repeated it after the mother. Then one night  
the child was ready to solo. 
The mother listened with pride to the carefully enunciated words, right up  
to the end. 
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us some e-mail"... 

?____________________ 


A little boy opened the big and old family Bible with fascination, and  
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Suddenly, something fell out of  
the Bible, and he picked it up and looked at it ?closely. It was an old leaf  
from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,  
look what I found," the boy called out. "What have you got there, dear?" his  
mother asked. 
With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered: "I think it's  
Adam's suit!" 

?____________________ 


Six-year-old Angie and her four-year-old brother Joel were sitting together  
in church. 
Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud. ?Finally, his big sister had enough. 
"You're not supposed to talk out loud in church." "Why? Who's going to stop  
me?" Joel asked. 
Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, "See those two men  
standing by the door?  
They're hushers." 

?____________________ 


A father was reading Bible stories to his young son. He read, "The man named  
Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city, but his wife 
looked  
back and was turned to salt." 
His son asked, "What happened to the flea?" 

?____________________ 


A three-year-old boy went with his dad to see a litter of kittens. On  
returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother,"There were 2 boy 
kittens  
and ?2 girl kittens." 
"How did you know?" his mother asked. "Daddy picked them up and looked  
underneath," he replied. "I think it's printed on the bottom."

Another three-year-old put his shoes on by himself. His mother noticed that  
the left shoe ?was on the right foot. She said, "Son, your shoes are on the  
wrong feet." 
He looked up at her with a raised brow and said, "Don't kid me, Mom. They're  
the only ?feet I got!."

On the first day of school, about midmorning, the kindergarten teacher said,

A mother and her young son returned from the grocery store and began putting  
away the groceries. The boy opened the box of animal crackers and spread 
them  
all over the table. 
"What are you doing?" his mother asked. "The box says not to eat them if the  
seal is broken" the boy explained. "I'm looking for the seal."

ADVICE TO GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS

1.  Don't imagine you can change a man, unless he's in diapers.

2.  What do you do if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.

3.  If they put a man on the moon, they should be able to put them
all up there.

4.  Never let your man's mind wander, it's too little to be out alone.

5.  Go for younger men. You might as well, they never mature anyway.

6.  Men are all the same, they just have different faces, so that you
can tell them apart.

7.  Definition of a bachelor; a man who has missed the opportunity to
make some woman miserable.

8.  Women don't make fools of men, most of them are the do it
yourself types.

9.  Best way to get a man to do something is to suggest they are too
old for it.

10. Love is blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.

11. If you want a committed man, look in a mental hospital.

12. The children of Israel wandered around the desert for 40 years.
Even in biblical times, men       wouldn't ask for directions.

13. If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him
checkbooks.

14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes,
it means that you laugh at     his.

15. Sadly, all men are created equal.

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!"

Hi
     
     I guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for!  Since you 
helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the All 
Products
section of stack manager ,  I can no longer select a financial swap product 
as a link to my physical products.  For example, I would like to link my 
HEHUB physical 
rest of month product to the gas daily HEHUB swap product.  Can you help me 
once again or refer me to someone who can?  Sorry, I did not realize these

Hi!

                  Yes,  we were discussing your lending habits and everyone 
was calling me a fricken mouch!  Your like a legend around here.
We still need to get together and share some of your previous comments with 
Craig.  How are you?  I miss you and get regular updates about how you are 
doing from you know who.  Been to any exciting ports lately.   Any baby 
news?  Not much new around here - John Craig keeps us laughing.  Take care!

Hi!

               CMS is correct - the price should be $8.74.

                                               
                                              Thank You!

Hi!

         Sandra Brawner trades the Gas Daily Finantial products for the Gulf 
Coast.  She will be on vacation tomorrow and has asked me to run these 
products for her.  I need to be able to manage these products.  I can already 
manage the Henry Hub (Griff Gray set this up for me).  Please call if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your help!

Taking a break from their first day of work, George W Bush and Dick Cheney  
go out to a restaurant near the White House.  
The waitress comes over and asks them what they would like. 
Dick orders the "Heart-Healthy" salad. 
The waitress turns to Dubya and asks him, "What would you like, Mr.  
President?" 
"I'd like a quickie." 
The waitress is shocked and astonished. In a huff, she exclaims, "I thought 
you were going to bring a new era of moral rectitude to the White House! 
Now I see that you, like all politicians, were lying! I'm sorry I ever voted 
for you!" and storms off. 
Bush sits there, stunned for a moment. 
Then Cheney leans over and says, "George, I think it's pronounced QUICHE."

This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

Hi!

               I submitted the claim by mail earlier this week - this is the 
third claim in a row I have had to send more than once.  I have only 
submitted three in the last several years and have had problems with all of 
them.

                                                                              
      Thanks for listening!

Can you tell me anything more about the deal - date & price?  Hopefully I can 
help with additional information.  Is this a one day deal?

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!"

Hi!

          It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron.  
I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for 
me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we 
generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two 
can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday 
season!  Take care!

?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop." 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, "I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel." 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, "How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, "Just try dem on, Saiheeb." 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????"YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!"

This is incorrect.  I started in 1976 -  I believe in June.  Please recheck.

                                                               Thank You!

.
An elderly woman and her little grandson, whose face 
was sprinkled 
with bright freckles, spent the day at the zoo. ?Lots 
of children 
were waiting in line to get their cheeks painted by a 
local artist 
who was decorating them with tiger paws. 

"You've got so many freckles, there's no place to 
paint!" a girl in 
the line said to the little fella. 

Embarrassed, the little boy dropped his head. His 
grandmother knelt 
down next to him. "I love your freckles. When I was a 
little girl I 
always wanted freckles," she said, while tracing her 
finger across 
the child's cheek. "Freckles are beautiful." 

The boy looked up, "Really?" 

"Of course," said the grandmother. "Why just name me 
one thing that's 
prettier than freckles." 

The little boy thought for a moment, peered intensely 
into his 
grandma's face, and softly whispered, "Wrinkles."

Hi!

                   Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new 
wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream 
gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee 
Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that 
we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long 
to get  back to you!

Subject: Fwd: FW: Advice on Self-Defense

I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA - HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH 
SOLID INFORMATION.

Hi, ladies,  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense
class, sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really 
valuable info with you before it goes out of my head.  The guy 
who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last 
year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one 
night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  
He started a women's group and began teaching these classes
soon after. This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice 
a year with Steven Segall. He and the  others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in  prison on 
what they look for and here's some interesting facts:

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  
They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, 
braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed.  They are 
also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short 
hair are not common targets.  

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for 
women who's clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit 
they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors 
around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut.

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their
purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off
guard and can be easily overpowered.

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is
in the early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. The number one place 
women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. 
Number two is office parking lots/garages. Number three is public 
rest rooms.

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman
and quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to
worry about getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons 
because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon 
is 15-20 years. If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get 
discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to 
realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be 
time-consuming. 

These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas, 
or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in
their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get 
really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon.  So, the 
idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it. 
Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:

* If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage
  or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face 
  and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general 
  small talk, I can't believe it is so cold out here, we're in 
  for a bad winter.  Now you've seen their face and could identify
  them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target.

* If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front 
  of you and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man
  talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed 
  that she would not be afraid to fight back.  Again, they are 
  looking for an EASY target.  If you carry pepper spray (this 
  instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him 
  wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it
  out will be a deterrent.

* If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you
  can by outsmarting them. If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist
  back so your hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and
  twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away. It is hard to 
  hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way. They stumble 
  toward you and you stumble back, so you can use that momentum to 
  bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the 
  forehead, nose or teeth.

* If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker
  either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper
  inner thigh. HARD. One woman in a class this guy taught told him 
  she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her
  and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle 
  strands - the guy needed stitches.
  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it.
  It hurts.

* After the initial hit, always go for the groin. I know from a
  particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's balls 
  (sorry to be graphic) it is extremely painful. You might think that 
  you'll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the 
  thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman 
  who will not cause a lot of trouble.
  Start causing trouble and he's out of there.

* When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers
  and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing 
  down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using 
  much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked 
  audibly.

Of course the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of
your surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see 
any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may 
feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy 
really was trouble.

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that
could save her life.

I do not show I did any deals outside of EOL with Koch at the Sabine Hub 
during this time frame.  Sitara deal #369260 refers to EOL deal ID 369298.

Taking a break from their first day of work, George W Bush and Dick Cheney  
go out to a restaurant near the White House.  
The waitress comes over and asks them what they would like. 
Dick orders the "Heart-Healthy" salad. 
The waitress turns to Dubya and asks him, "What would you like, Mr.  
President?" 
"I'd like a quickie." 
The waitress is shocked and astonished. In a huff, she exclaims, "I thought 
you were going to bring a new era of moral rectitude to the White House! 
Now I see that you, like all politicians, were lying! I'm sorry I ever voted 
for you!" and storms off. 
Bush sits there, stunned for a moment. 
Then Cheney leans over and says, "George, I think it's pronounced QUICHE."

Subject: Fw: 5 questions most feared by men are




The 5 questions most feared by men are:

1. What are you thinking about?
2. Do you love me?
3. Do I look fat?
4. Do you think she is prettier than me?
5. What would you do if I died?

What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed
to 
explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e.,
tells 
the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed
below, 
along with possible responses.

QUESTION #1: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I'm sorry if I've been quiet 
dear.  I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful,
caring, 
intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."

This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which
most 
likely is one of the following:
1. Hockey.
2. Sex.
3. How fat you are.
4. How much prettier she is than you.
5. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.

Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who
once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be 
talking to you!"

QUESTION #2: DO YOU LOVE ME?

The proper response is: "YES" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is
in 
order, "Yes, dear."

Inappropriate responses include:
1. Oh Yeah, shit loads.
2. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?
3. That depends on what you mean by love.
4. Does it matter?
5. Who? Me?

QUESTION #3: DO I LOOK FAT?

The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!"

Among the incorrect answers are:
1. Compared to what?
2. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.
3. A little extra weight looks good on you.
4. I've seen fatter.
5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would 
spend the insurance money if you died.

QUESTION #4: DO YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTIER THAN ME?

Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"

Incorrect responses include:
1. Yes, but you have a better personality.
2. Not prettier, but definitely thinner.
3. Not as pretty as you were when you were her age.
4. Define pretty.
5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would
spend the insurance money if you died.

QUESTION #5: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I DIED?

A definite no-win question. The real answer, of course, is "Buy Corvette
and Boat". No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an
hour 
of follow-up questions, usually along these lines:

Woman: Would you get married again?
Man: Definitely not!

Woman: Why not? Don't you like being married?
Man: Of course I do.

Woman: Then why wouldn't you remarry?
Man: Okay, I'd get married again.

Woman: You would?(WITH A HURT LOOK ON HER FACE) Would you sleep with her
in our bed?
Man: Where else would we sleep?

Woman: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of
her?
Man: That would seem like the proper thing to do.

Woman: And would you let her use my golf clubs?
Man: She can't use them; she's left-handed.

Woman: ---silence---
Man: shit

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Hi!

           Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to 
confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of 
Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place 
for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron 
and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current 
purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.


                                                                              
                                                                            
Thank you!

Ok-I know you are probably mad at me because I have not contacted you since 
I've been here.  Believe me it is not because I haven't thought of you.  I 
thought for sure I'd run into you somewhere in the building but never have.  
Anyway I'm sending you a note to tell you to be on the look out for an 
invitation to a Nebraska Football party we are having on the 11th.  I am 
putting it in the interoffice mail this morning.  Hope you can make it.

Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
"total body conditioning class"  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the "total 
body conditioning class" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an "ab lab" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.

Hi!

         How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a 
bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused 
several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone 
with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and 
I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 
to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off 
Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I 
finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and 
my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to 
nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - 
it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don 
told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn 
has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are 
not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better 
go.  Love you and take care of yourself.

I resubmitted the claim by mail and have not heard anything  -  the service I 
have received from the customer service department in the last six months has 
been terrible - one delay after another  - lost claims.  It is very 
frustrating.  I will let you know when I get a response.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Hi!

                  How is your day going?  Yesterday was better for me!  The 
vote for who did better in the debate last night seems to be Gore.

                                                                              
                                            
                                                                              
                                            Love You!

Hi!

            You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and 
see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on 
the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on 
Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad 
you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling 
during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating 
the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a 
thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one 
of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for 
Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be 
coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to 
stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but 
let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas!

  How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Not much going on here - I 
think I'll go see the new movie with Richard Gere on Friday - wish you were 
here so we could go and sob together.  Drop me a line if you get a chance.

Greg,
 I am mailing to you a copy of the unwind/rebook summary for the Trigen 
deal.  When this was rebooked in 1998, Elsa Piekielniak 
would not sign off on it unless there was a plant prudency incase the plant 
went down for force majeure or maintenance.  This was $1,200,000.
Per the worksheet I have mailed to you, it shows thawt $1,200,000 was set 
aside in schedule c.

 Here is my question - what ever happened to the $1,200,000?  Is is still 
around?  The reason I am asking is because the plant has gone
down this year.

Hi!

           I'm so glad everything is going well with the kids - what is Jay 
going to study?  I am worried about Dani driving too - just don't tell me - 
there's no need for both of us to worry (just kidding).  When do they start 
back to school?  Some kids in Houston started this week already.  I so enjoy 
the summer when the traffic is lighter.  I have started getting to work 
earlier between 7:00 - 7:15 so that helps some.  Dick told me his brothers 
Charles & Russell and families are planning to come to Houston for Christmas 
- I started sweating immediately.  What will we do with all these teenagers & 
ANDREW?  


                                                                              
                                                                              
    Love you & take care of yourself!
