As we prepare to migrate to Microsoft Windows 2000 and Outlook 2000, we want 
to provide information on Outlook...the product, the implementation, and 
Enron's email guidelines, in general.  Microsoft Outlook 2000 integrates more 
effectively with the Windows 2000 Operating System and other Microsoft 
products than does Lotus Notes.  Further it provides a more robust mail 
platform.  Additional benefits include the ability to update your hand-held 
device from multiple places, and the ability to retrieve your Enron E-mail 
via a browser.

Mail Conversion Process - You will not lose any mail messages in the 
conversion to Outlook!  The last 30 days of mail will be converted to 
Outlook.  All other mail messages in your Notes database will be available 
via a read-only browser-based Notes file.  The Enron E-mail retention policy 
described below will apply to all mail files.  All information in your 
personal address book will be converted to Outlook.

Notes Databases - After the Outlook conversion, you will not have Notes on 
your desktop; thus, all Notes databases will be web-enabled.  If you are the 
owner of a Notes database, you will be contacted soon to schedule the 
conversion.

Notes Archive Databases - Archiving of mail messages is a violation of the 
mail retention policy.  No archive database will be supported or converted to 
Outlook.  You will not have access to the file after the conversion.

Training - To ensure your successful conversion to Outlook 2000, you will be 
required to sign up for and attend a hands-on training class.  The class will 
consist of an overview of Windows 2000 and Outlook.  You will also receive 
brochures and other documentation as you are migrated to Outlook.  

Encrypted Mail
Encrypted mail messages will not be converted to Outlook.  If you have any 
encrypted messages in your current mail file, we will contact you directly 
prior to your conversion.

Mailbox Size - User Mailboxes will be restricted to 100 MB.  Warnings will be 
sent as your mail file reaches 75MB.  After your mail file reaches 100 MB, 
you will no longer be able to send messages.

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - The restricted size for both incoming and 
outgoing mail is now 10MB.

Email Retention Policy - Below is a copy of the Email Retention Policy.  This 
policy will be enforced with the Outlook Implementation.

Message Location	Maximum Retention
Inbox	30 days
Message Log/Sent Mail 	30 days
Trash	Rollover from Inbox for 15 days
Bulletin Boards	30 days
Folders/Archives	E-mail messages placed in folders/archives
Archives	All e-mail messages placed in archives will be destroyed after one 
year.

Your next communication will be shortly before your migration date.  If you 
have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to call us.

Subject: socket vs tibco


Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.

In approximately one month (9/9/2000), we are targeting that a new version of 
the Oracle NT client (8.1.6), Borland Database Engine (BDE) 5.1.1 and 
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5. to all Corp/ENA workstations. 
This software provides the connectivity from your workstation to Enron's 
Oracle databases and the applications supported by them.  We are currently in 
the process of testing all the applications managed by Corp/ENA Information 
Technology to ensure that they will be compliant with this new software.

This change may also effect your own developed MS-Access, MS-Excel 
spreadsheets, and/or MS-Query documents that retrieve data from Enron's 
Oracle databases via ODBC drivers. As part of the upgrade, all Oracle ODBC 
connections will be upgraded to compliant driver versions. 

If you would like to test your MS-Access databases and/or MS-Excel 
spreadsheets under the new software releases, please use one of the 
workstations at one of the following locations for your testing:

General users
EB2230D
EB2778B
EB0504P
EB4857

Traders and developers only please
EB2904E 
EB3067
EB3138B

You may contact your floor support representative for any testing assistance.

Michelle -- I am glad they finally fixed your name!   

You need to go under "Actions", Calendar Tools", "Calendar Profile" and under 
mail file owner go out to the address book and reselect your name.    

Page me if you have any questions.    Thanks, Jean 1-800-906-8093

Subject: Michelle Lokay Name Problem

The notes team has corrected her name from Michele to Michelle.  But as you 
can see in her letter head it still come up as Michele.
How do we change that.  I've reset up her notes from scratch to see if that 
corrected the problem.  
For the long run - should we just get corrected ID file from the Notes Team?

At approximately 8:15 a.m. on Monday morning, September 25th, the GTA server 
went down due to a corrupted System volume.  The GTA server has an identical 
failover server that is being mirrored throughout the day.  Unfortunately, 
this data corruption also occurred on the failover's System volume.  In the 
recovery process, we were unable to bring up the failover due to the 
corruption on both servers.

Vendor support was required in order to recover GTA and the corrupted 
volume.  Although we talked to the vendor about possible causes for the 
corruption, our primary focus was on the server recovery.  The server was 
operational at approximately 11:10 am.  The Server Platform Team is working 
with the vendors to determine the root cause. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

If you have any questions, please call Bob Martinez at 713-853-7574.

Thanks,

ETS Solution Center

In our effort to continue to develop the Marketing Dashboard to meet your 
needs and to help you manage your business, we are rolling out our next 
release of the Marketing Dashboard.   We have taken your feedback from the 
survey as well as added additional functionality that will enhance the 
effectiveness.   Below is a list of the new functionality & features:

* Created a new graphical design with multiple pages using 'tabs' to organize 
the information better 
* Created a tab labeled 'My Pipeline' for you to customize with the 
categories of your choice
* Added a specific tab for NNG as well as the ability to add multiple 
pipelines in the future
* Additional business and market intelligence categories have been added 
through secondary tabs
* Created an Alert bar to allow you to identify specific conditions to notify 
you through the Dashboard
* Ability to add security to individual categories on the portal

Here are a few simple steps to take to access the new site:

1) From Internet Explorer 5.0, enter the link below or click on it here to 
access:
 http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/

2) You will be required to put in a new I.D. and password - the ID & 
passwords are the same as your LAN id: 
 * It is the initial of your first name followed by seven digits of your last 
name 
 (ex. mjanouse for both ID & password)

3) The new Dashboard will appear with defaults in each tab: 
 * You can then customize according to your needs and interests.
 * The default will prompt you to the 'My Pipeline' tab;
  - This tab contains categories from the NNG tab but with personalization 
features
  - You can remove categories from here if you do not use them in your 
day-to-day
 * The NNG tab is the replication of most of the categories from our current 
Dashboard:
  -  Some categories have been moved to other tabs.   (ex. Weather )
 * To save this new Dashboard as your 'homepage', please do the following:
  - Go to the top right utility navigation bar which says 'set as your 
homepage' 
  - Click on it and then when the window comes up for verification, click OK
  - Now, when you log on to your PC, click on the IE5 symbol 
  - Please delete current shortcut on your desktop to old Dashboard 

Here are a few notes and helpful hints to make your dashboard experience a 
joyful one:

Favorites -  Favorites are now called links and are available in the upper 
right content of each tab.  You can create as many link categories as you 
like and you may now group similar links by entering a custom title when you 
edit your list.
Memo -  The Memo pad allows you to jot yourself a note without leaving the 
dashboard.  You can create as many memo pads as you like. 


If you have any other questions, please call Bobby Mason at x3-5196 or myself 
at x3-7275.   Thanks!!

Over the last few months, we have been discussing our standard E-mail=20
platform with you, our customer.  Your feedback from the various=20
demonstrations, surveys and Technology Showcases validated that E-mail is a=
=20
vital part of your ability to communicate effectively.  However, your=20
feedback also indicated that you need your E-mail client to have additional=
=20
functionality and increased integration with other applications you use. =
=20
Therefore, to meet the demands of our fast-paced business, Enron Net Works =
is=20
standardizing our E-mail platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook 2000 to al=
l=20
the Business Units we currently support for messaging.  (Project plans for=
=20
EBS, EES and Azurix are still being finalized and will be communicated=20
separately.)

This conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000 will improve your ability =

=20
office applications you use on a daily basis.  We are excited about this=20
opportunity to provide a more robust, full function solution for your=20
messaging needs.   To provide you with additional details about the=20
conversion from Lotus Notes to Outlook 2000, we are including a list of=20
frequently asked questions about this project.

How does this project affect me?
Your current Lotus Notes E-mail system will be converted to Microsoft Outlo=

What is Microsoft Outlook 2000?
Outlook 2000 is the messaging client you will use to read your E-mail, upda=
te=20
your calendar and personal address book, record to do lists, etc.

Why are we switching to Outlook 2000?
Outlook 2000 integrates more effectively with our new operating system,=20
Windows 2000, and the Microsoft products that Enron currently uses. With=20
Outlook 2000, we can provide you with a more robust mail platform including=
=20
the following new features:

Instant Messaging =01) Ability to send person-to-person, immediate, pop-up=
=20
messages.
Improved Palm/CE Synchronization =01) Allows for simpler and quicker update=
s of=20
your hand held device from multiple places.
Conferencing Server =01) Ability to conduct video conferences from your des=
ktop.
Web Access =01) Ability to retrieve your Enron E-mail via a browser.
Fax Integration =01) Ability to send/receive faxes from your E-mail Inbox.
Voice Mail Integration =01) Ability to have your voice mail delivered to yo=
ur=20
E-mail Inbox for retrieval.

When will the Outlook 2000 rollout start and when will I get it?
The pilot will begin in late October with the production rollout beginning =

late November.  We are finalizing our Business Unit rollout schedule. =20
Additional information will be provided to all business units as it becomes=

? Gas Daily and Inside FERC  - these two links have been replaced with one 
link named Online Publications.
? NNG and TW Notices  - Non-critical notices have been added to the streaming

allocations, capacity constraints and maintenance.  Critical notices will be 
displayed in a red font. 

B) Additions to the Navigation Bar 

? eHRonline  - is a new a link on the navigation bar.

C) New Categories for your personalized portal window: 

? Revenue Management   - a new category with five links to revenue management 
and business economics information sites.

other items and stories from various ET&S departments.
? Morning Meeting Reports - this category contains links to Gas Control's

To add these new categories to your dashboard simply click on the personalize 
button, highlight the new available category in Pane 1 (left), Pane 2

Attached is a coding quick reference sheet (Coding.QuickRef.xls) that I hope 
will be useful in the coding of expense reports and miscellaneous vendor 
invoices that may pass your desk.  I have also attached a copy of the "GPG 
SAP Coding Block" (Coding.doc) which explains the different SAP coding block 
requirements.  SAP coding must now be used in order to process expense 
reports and vendor invoices.  If you need additional coding information, 
please contact one of the following ET&S General Accountants in Houston:
 
      

If I have left anyone off of the distribution list that you think may benefit 
from these coding aids, please forward this note to them.  Also, if you have 
any suggestions or comments to add or subtract (or correct) information that 
may make the coding quick reference sheet easier to use, please let me know. 


Thanks,

You asked how your Gross Margin % could be higher in 2000 but your overall 
Gross Margin be lower. 

You appear to have lower invoiced volumes in Jan-April 2000.  

January and Feb. -for example:






Great question!

This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

Importance:     High 

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to <http://twdev.ets.enron.com> our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

The following network changes are being planned for EOL: 

Feb. 3  Saturday From 9:00 am - 11:00 a.m., 
Enron Network Services will be upgrading the EOL UUNET network connection 
(one of Enron's ISP) from 12Mbps to 27Mbps. Because UUNET is not the primary 
EOL link, the outage is not expected to impact many of the EOL users.  
However, if users have their connection configured to UUNET as their 
preferred ISP, they may have to reconnect and may experience intermittent 
outages during this maintenance.

Feb. 3  Saturday From 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.,
Enron Network Services will be upgrading the EOL Internet network switches.  
A total outage of EOL is expected.  The outage should last approximately 30 
minutes.

Please notify Jean McFarland or Mary Vollmer if you have any questions.

GPG will begin gathering information in September for our migration to=20
Windows 2000 and Outlook/Exchange.

Windows 2000 (or W2K) is Microsoft's newest operating system and has been=
=20
selected as Enron's standard desktop operating system.  Along with this=20
change, we are moving from Lotus Notes to Outlook/Exchange as our standard=
=20
messaging (email) application. =20

This project is a huge undertaking, and we need everyone=01,s assistance to=
=20
ensure success.  The GPG-IT team will partner with each group to ensure eve=
ry=20
aspect is covered.   Each group (IT and the User group) will assign a Point=
=20
of Contact (POC) to  work with the IT group.  The POC's responsibilities=20
include application information gathering, identifying security requirement=
s,=20
documenting all issues and concerns, and communicating project status.

We are approaching the Windows 2000/Exchange Project in a phased approach.

Phase I, starting now and running through November, consists of =01&Informa=
tion=20
Gathering=018 about hardware, applications, issues, as well as application=
=20
testing in our Windows 2000 lab and user sign-off.  The Phase I findings wi=
ll=20
determine the Phase II start date.

Phase II, will be the actual =01&Implementation=018 of desktop hardware, Wi=
ndows=20
2000 and Outlook software, and user training.  We will also be migrating=20
"user" data on the network to a Windows 2000 file server and migrating=20
applications to a Windows 2000 application server.=20

Some of the benefits of migrating to W2K
Increased desktop reliability and response time.  Windows 2000 is much more=
=20
stable and robust than Windows 95/98/NT.
Increased system performance because minimum hardware requirements for W2K=
=20
are 350 MHz and above with 256 MEG memory. =20
Increased desktop manageability and enhanced functionality. =20
Single sign-on for all users/servers.  No more problems with trying to keep=
=20
all your LAN and email passwords the same!

Some of the impacts to migrating to W2K
Some of the old Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Access) documents will=
=20
need to be updated.  If you have any old documents that you think will not=
=20
move forward to W2K, please communicate this to your IT POC.=20
We are aware that some hardware and applications may have problems running =
in=20
Windows 2000.  We will work together to find a suitable solution for=20
everyone. =20

Another communication with much more detail regarding W2K and Outlook will =

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713

Houston-area ET&S employees:  (The Marketing group should have already been 
contacted by Jean McFarland.)




Next week, we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 2000/Outlook 
Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about the hardware 
and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  This email will do a quick inventory 
of applications you have installed on your PC or that you may access from the 
network, as well as your desktop hardware specifications.  The information 
gathered from this email will be stored in a Notes database for reporting.  
It is very important that you open this email from your primary workstation.  
Please do not open it remotely, or if you're checking someone else's mail.

Mid-week, we will deploy teams to conduct individual interviews to assure 
that we have a complete picture of your technical environment.  This process 
will take approximately six weeks to complete for all of ETS.  The findings 
from these interviews will determine the Phase II start date.

Data Responsibility

As we prepare for this massive effort, we ask that you assist us by doing the 
following:
1) identify any business-related applications that may reside locally.
2) remove data from the local drive of your desktop (c:\ and/or d:\), and 
store it on your network drive.  The special data requirements of laptop  
users will be addressed during the actual migration.
3) remove all non-business-related data from network drives.
4) remove non-company-owned applications from your environment.
5) if you have historical data that does not change, contact the Solution 
Center and have a CD created for a more permanent storage method.


Training for Windows 2000/Outlook

Training requirements will be addressed during Phase II by a number of 
methods that will include:
hands-on training, which will consist of 1 hour on Windows 2000 and 2 hours 
on Outlook,
IPTV video,
tri-fold cards on the Microsoft products, and
CBT (Computer-Based Training).  

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact

WinInstall Will Run on Friday

A WinInstall screen will appear during your login on Friday, February  9, 
2001.  

WinInstall will then make updates to your computer including:
McAfee anti-virus software update

The WinInstall process will take approximately 1 minute to complete.  A bar 
showing percentage of completion is displayed during the process.  Please

Thank you!  I have tested the updated system and every thing seems to be 
working.  I did speak to the Help Desk last week and it was decided that we 
will run this program through Netscape Navigator vs Explorer.

Michelle,
Thanks for your patience.  It works now.
We don't know exact why it suddenly stops calculating marginal fuel.  Each 
piece of program worked correctly.  
We had to rule out possible causes step by step and to make sure the whole 
process work step by step.
Possible reason might be multiple version of calculation component being 
registered in the server and
the correct one was not used lately.  We cleaned it and re-registered the 
working version and it worked. 

Did you have chance to talk to help desk regarding internet explorer upgrade 
to 5.0 ?

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

Jean, per our conversation today, please add Netscape to the following users 
PC's.  The application is required to run the "Deal Analysis" program 
recently completed by Dave Foti.  This program was written to help the 
marketing team analyze the profitability of new transport deals and the fuel 
consumed on the proposed pipeline path.  I understand we will lose the 
Netscape capability in approx. 3 months with the advent of Windows 2000.

thanks for the help

Effective Monday, January 7, 2002, Dynegydirect will institute a "new look"
on our Trade Floors. The new look will have ACTIVE and INACTIVE markets
designated with green and red lights to the right of the product line.

Upon opening your individual Trade Floor/Window the window may not contain
the usual number of products. You have two choices to make:

                                 Choice 1:
A "SHOW ALL MKTS" button will be on the upper right of the screen. If you
check this, all the markets you have saved in your trading window(s) will
appear, just as they always have, whether the markets are ACTIVE or
INACTIVE. You will not see the green and red lights to the right of the
product line.
                                 Choice 2:
If you do not check the "SHOW ALL MKTS" button, the window may be blank
until Dynegy begins posting prices and volumes and a "REFRESH" button
appears on the top center of the window. Clicking on the "REFRESH" button
will enable ACTIVE markets, which will be indicated by a GREEN light to the
right of the product line. The light will remain GREEN for 30 seconds after
activation.

The "REFRESH" button will reappear as additional markets become ACTIVE or
as an existing market becomes INACTIVE. When Dynegy places a product on
hold (INACTIVE market) the price and volume will disappear and a RED light
will appear to the right of the product line after 15 minutes of
inactivity.

Clicking on the "REFRESH" button will add all ACTIVE markets and/or remove
all INACTIVE markets.


ADDITIONAL NOTE:
Any new Trading Windows you create from Monday forward will default to
Choice 2.

What does this all mean for you after July 1, 2000?

New SAP Coding for everyone
 This includes all new General Ledger Accounts, Workorder numbers and Cost 
Centers.  Company numbers have now been expanded to four positions.

internal services such as:
   Forms & Stationary   
  Overnight Deliveries (Fed Ex, UPS, etc.)
  Audio/Visual Services
  TAP - Travel Agency in the Park
  A/C Lighting after hours
  Catering
  Contract Staff

New forms have been developed
 Invoice and Expense Reports will accommodate the new SAP codes.

vity issues.  We are continuing to investigate this issue. You can continue=
 to try and log into the ICE, as this issue may be resolved shortly.  Thank=
 you.                                                                      =

WinInstall Will Run on Friday

A WinInstall screen will appear during your login on Friday, January 12, 
2001.  

WinInstall will then make updates to your computer including:
McAfee anti-virus software update

The WinInstall process will take approximately 1 minute to complete.  A bar 
showing percentage of completion is displayed during the process.  Please 
note that during the update, you should not disturb the machine.  Doing so

Recently, Corp Information Risk Management has sent out several messages 
regarding the correct method to obtain security.  The topics you may have 
seen include SRRS Decommissioning, and announcements of the 
http://itcentral.enron.com website, as well as the eRequest system.  These 
messages are intended for Enron Corporate/North America users only.  At this 
time, they do not apply to ETS employees.

ETS is working with the Corp Information Risk Management group to incorporate 
our security access methods with theirs.   Until the process is complete, ETS 
employees should contact the following groups for security issues/requests:

 Houston: ETS Solution Center at 713-345-4745, or 
   ETS Solution Center (mailbox name)
 Omaha:  Omaha Help Desk at 402-398-7454, or
   Omaha Helpdesk (mailbox name)

When the security preparations are complete, you will be able to access the 
eRequest system from the Solution Center page on the ETS website 
(http://www.ets.enron.com).  You might want to save this site on your 
Favorites, and watch for future announcements from the ETS Solution Center 
mailbox.

We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

Concur Technologies=01, Expense Management System (XMS) is now available to=
 all=20
ETS employees.  You can prepare your expense report, send it for approval,=
=20
and transmit it for payment using the intranet.  It is more "user-friendly"=
=20
than the previous Excel-based form and efficiently integrates with the SAP=
=20
accounting system.  We request and encourage you to start using it.

System access on the Enron intranet:

To access the system, go to the Enron Transportation Services Home Page and=
=20
type "http://xms.enron.com" in the "Location"  field.  This will access XMS=
=20
software.

LOGON ID=20
Enter your personnel number (P number).   If you don't know your "P" number=
,=20
your "HR rep." has it!

PASSWORD
The first time you log in, the password is upper case ENRON.  The system wi=
ll=20
guide you through confirming your personal information and changing your=20
password.  The Enron Code of Ethics prohibits the sharing of passwords and=
=20
logging on as another person.  Please observe Enron=01,s policy. =20

If you can't log in to the system, go to the IT Central web page from the=
=20
Enron intranet home page and select "Services"
click "Security Requests" click "eRequest"  (or call 713-853-5536).

OTHER
Once "in", the XMS system will help you get set up, including designating=
=20
those who will be approving your expense report, and, if applicable, those=
=20
who have been designated to prepare your expense report. Additionally, ther=
e=20
is a "tour" that you can take to get acquainted with system features.

User Guide!!
Hard copy step-by-step documentation is also available from "IT Central" we=
b=20
page on the Enron intranet.
After getting to "IT Central" on the Enron intranet, click through the=20
following and you should be there:
"Services", "Training", "Documentation", "XMS User's Guide" (which will com=
e=20
up through Adobe Acrobat).

Application Support Services
Call the ISC help desk at 713-345-4SAP (4727).=20

Accounting Coding=20
No changes in coding are being implemented as a result of the transition fr=
om=20
the Excel template to XMS, in fact much of the coding will be "suggested" b=
y=20
the XMS software. You will need a FAR #, cost center, or WBS elements as=20
applicable.


GOOD LUCK!!

I have replace the old basis differential with Michelle's new numbers and 
migrated the program to
production.  So TW Deal Analysis is using the new basis differential now.

DBA,
Please migrate up_TWDA_deal_analysis in etstest/twprod01 to dbo, and to 
etsmo/twprod01, mojo/twprod01.
Grant execute to developers, TWDP in etstest
Grant execute to TWDP in etsmo and etsmojo

Gary,
Per user request, we need to replace basis differential for TW Deal Analysis 
forward pricing that was hard coded
in the program with the latest numbers as stated in the e-mail from Michelle 
Lokay.  We are working on
accessing the information from revenue management table as soon as the data 
is available in the database. 
This change does not impact any other applications.
Please approve it and forward this request to ets dba.

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

There will be two changes to the EnronOnline Website, effective for Monday 
morning:

1) There will be a new release for internal users only, which should fix the 
freeze-up of floating windows which some users have reported.
2) The old version of EnronOnline (the vesion without the news and weather 
content) will no longer be available.

The old version will be retired to make way for new functionality such as the 
Spreads product, which will allow customers to simultaneously transact in 
both of the underlying legs of a spread simultaneously.

Some customers are still transacting through the old version of the 
EnronOnline website. We are making every effort to contact all such customers 
directly, but it is possible they may call you, complaining that their 
website doesn't work. If this happens, please do the following:

1) Explain that the new version of the website is just as fast as the old 
version, but has additional functionality, like floating windows, news and 
weather.
2) Explain that there are solutions for any technical difficulties they might 
have in upgrading
3) Transfer them to Product Control for additional assistance.

The Marketing migration to Windows 2000/Outlook has been delayed until the 
week of February 20.  I am very concerned with applications and I want to 
make sure everything is 100% ready before we move forward.  

Some of the activities originally scheduled for the week of February 5th will 
move forward as planned.   Users will be contacted on an individual basis.

If you have any questions regarding the Windows 2000/Outlook migration, 
please contact me directly.   I apologize for any problems this delay in 
schedule may have caused.

Thanks.  Jean 87-7173  /pager 1-877-506-6529

We are pleased to announce that effective immediately we are consolidating=

the two Omaha Infrastructure teams into one team that supports Enron=01,s T=

Pacific Place office building in Omaha.  We believe this consolidation will=
=20
provide all Enron employees in Omaha better support in a more efficient=20
manner.  This new team will continue to work with the Houston ETS=20
Infrastructure team to implement the ETS standard across companies and citi=
es.

Joe Palik will lead the new team.  Joe and the team will be responsible for=
=20
all the day-to-day operations relating to help desk calls, desktop support,=
=20
and Infrastructure support.  Joe will have a dual reporting role to both To=
ny=20
Mayer and Bob Martinez.=20

Jean McFarland is moving into full-time project management, reporting to Bo=
b=20
Martinez.  In the near-term, in addition to her project work, Jean will=20
remain accessible to her current customers and Joe and his team to help in=
=20
this transition.

Until the completion of the Omaha Windows 2000 and Exchange implementation,=
=20
Mike Guzman and Tommy Sellers will be spending the majority of their time o=
n=20
this project reporting to Jean.  Jean will continue to have responsibility=
=20
for this and other key ETS projects currently in progress or planned for=20
2001.  Diane Becker will continue to work on the Windows 2000 Security item=
s=20
along with her help desk responsibilities.

Once the Windows 2000 project is complete, reporting to Joe will be:

 Infrastructure Platform:  Helpdesk/Desktop:
 Mike Guzman (W2K)    Karen Melton
 Mike Rasmussen  Diane Becker
 Tyler Theobald ,  Randy Lukken
Dan Bunch
       Ed Wojcik
     Tommy Sellers , (W2K)

The first step in this merger will be to combine the help desks and move to=
 a=20
common help desk call system.  Once this is complete, we=01,ll initiate=20
cross-training activities in the desktop support area, allowing these suppo=
rt=20
functions to be shared.=20

Please congratulate Jean and Joe on their new responsibilities and work wit=

them to ensure a smooth transition to one support team for Omaha.  If you=

You can install the TW Map program via these instructions:

Got to the "Start" button -> Programs -> Standard Applications -> Winstall 
for Other Apps.

After winstall loads, scroll down in the "Available Applications" windows 
until you see
"TW Map #1". 

Click once on the "TW Map #1" then on "Install".

Click on "OK" then on the "Exit" button to close Winstall.

You should see an ICON on your desktop labeled "TW Map".  Another application 
should appear

Except Marketing:  




This is a reminder that we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 
2000/Outlook Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about 
the hardware and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  Because the Marketing group's 
inventory was performed by Omaha, they should not open the message.  This 
email will do a quick inventory of applications you have installed on your PC 
or that you may access from the network, as well as your desktop hardware 
specifications.  The information gathered from this email will be stored in a 
Notes database for reporting.  It is very important that you open this email 
from your primary workstation.  Please do not open it remotely, or if you're 
checking someone else's mail.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact

Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporti=
ng=20
product, Concur Technologies=01, Expense Management System (XMS).  You will=
 be=20
able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it=

for payment using the Intranet.  It will be far more user-friendly than the=
=20
Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless=20
process.  In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP=20
accounting system. =20

On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded t=
o=20
the most current release.  On October 30, it will be available to Enron Cor=
p=20
employees, Company 0011.  The rollout to other groups will continue through=
=20
January 2001.  Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.=20

In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To=20

on-line training can use LEAP by signing on to sap.enron.com and clicking o=

With the completion of the Enron SAP implementation known as "Apollo & 
Beyond" in August 2000, a new organization, the Integrated Solutions Center 
(ISC), was formed. The ISC is a support organization for Enron-wide back 
office information systems which, of course, includes SAP users and the SAP 
system.

The web is an integral form of support for our customers and as you may know, 
the ISC recently launched a new website in order to better serve its 
customers and to reflect the widening scope of services the ISC has to 
offer.  

>From Friday 1st December 2000 sap.enron.com will route to isc.enron.com in 
preparation for the final closure of the "old" website on Tuesday 5th 
December 2000.  

All due diligence was taken when verifying and validating documents that were 
migrated from the old to the new site.  In order to assist you in navigating 
around isc.enron.com, please note the following navigation tips:

- Online forms reside at isc.enron.com > Online Forms

- Non-online forms (formerly at sap.enron.com > Quick Ref Tools) reside in 
the Document Library at  isc.enron.com > Online Forms > Other forms

- Documentation (ie User Procedures, quick ref cards, step-by-steps) reside 
in the Document Library at isc.enron.com under Get Help > Document Library

Please take a moment today to visit http://isc.enron.com and familiarize 
yourself with the new site if you haven't already been able to do so.

Questions & Comments

Website only:  Call the ISC Call Center at 713-345-4SAP, or send an e-mail 
from the site to the ISC Webmaster.

Please remember, all expense reports should be prepared using the new SAP 
REPORTING FORM ONLY.  All codings, be it expense reports, invoicing, etc., 
will have to be submitted with our new company number (0060) and our new Cost

Once again, I am sending you the pdf file for the latest and greatest news 
about the SAP implementation.  We found out the computer I used this time had 
a different version of Acrobat so try this one.   Double click on the 
attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  If the error message that no 
application is found, click your START button,  click on Programs and then 
Utilities which should bring up Acrobat Reader at the top.  Click on that and 
load the application. 

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different version, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.

As you are aware, the SAP Financial Systems will be implemented for the Enron 
Gas Pipeline Group, Enron North America and Enron Energy Services companies 
on July 1, 2000.  To effectively transfer the invoice processing from the 
legacy MSA system to the SAP system, the following dates should be followed:


June 23: Invoice processing on the MSA system will stop except for emergency 
payments, wire transfers and ACHs.

June 26: Invoice processing on the SAP system will begin for the GPG, ENA and 
EES companies.  Accounts Payables will input invoices into the SAP system 
starting on this date, but checks will not be printed until the first payment 
run is processed on July 5.

June 28: Last day to input employee expense reports with ACH in the MSA 
system.

June 29: Last day to input emergency payments and wire transfers in the MSA 
system.

June 30: Accounts Payable to clean up outstanding open balances in the MSA 
system.

July 5:  All invoices will be entered into SAP and the first payment run is 
processed.


Please remember, all invoices sent to Accounts Payable on or after June 23 
must have SAP general ledger coding applied to the invoice.

Michelle,

If you have experienced problems using TW Deal Analysis lately, it has been 
fixed.

Whenever we run TW Deal Analysis, we have the report id generated by the 
database automatically.
Unfortunately the database crashed and recovered later.  It did not start 
from the last number in the database,
instead,  it started with a very large 12 digit number.  The application did 
not expect to handle such a large
number and could not continue.  

I am working on changing report id generation to be manual function so that 
next time
if database server crashes, the application will not be affected.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Mei-Ling

In our continuing effort to expand the Dashboard, the following items have 
been added: 

New Categories for your personalized portal window: 

New categories have been added for each group in ET&S Business Development 
and Marketing.  This gives each group the ability to post/publish their 
information on the dashboard for viewing.  These new categories are listed 
below:

? Storage Services
? Risk Mgmt & Report  
? Pricing & Structuring
? North Power Bus Dev
? South Power Bus Dev
? Offshore Bus Dev
? North LDC Team
? Central LDC Team
? Marketing Analysis
? Information Services

To add these new categories to your dashboard simply click on the personalize 
button, highlight the new available category in Pane 1 (left), Pane 2 
(center), or Pane 3 (right) and click on the add button.  This action will 
move this category from available to the bottom of the selected categories.  
If you would like to change the order within a pane you click on the selected 
category then move it up or down using the arrows to the right of the 
selected categories pane.  You then click save to exit the personalize screen 
and return to the dashboard.

If you have any problems or questions please contact Bobby Mason @ (713)

One of the deliverables of Revenue Management is the Marketing Dashboard 
which, among a veritable cornucopia of features, will include live Nymex and 
Enron OnLine data pricing feeds.  The rollout of the Dashboard for NNG and TW 
is in the next 2 weeks.  However, the Nymex data feed won't happen till 
August due to technology limitations.  

In the meantime, via our desktops, we all have access to Enron OnLine which 
provides live market data that is as good or better than Nymex.  This should 
suffice in the interim till the Dashboard is fully functional.  Let me know 
if you have questions.

thanks

E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice

We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail=20
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000=
.

The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained onl=
y=20
30 days as compared to the current 365 days. =20

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important=20
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up=
.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the=20
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific=
=20
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic=
=20
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and=
=20
voice mail.

and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enro=
n=20

=20
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron=20

During our Envision training session the question came up as to whether or not we can send documents to our customers from Envision via Email.

After working with Sylvia Thomas, the answer is yes and no.  Yes, we can get documents form Envision to the customer easily.  No we can't do it through Email.
Sylvia and her team, however, are going to look into the possibility of being able to send information from Envision securely through Email.

In the meantime, you can fax information directly from Envision to your customer.  Directions are attached.  If you have any questions or problems, feel free to call.

Please read note below from our SAP Timekeeping Team:


By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period.

Gary,
Changes related to TW basis differential for TW Deal Analysis is completed. 
Michelle Lokay has reviewed the new index price using the new tables and 
logic.  
The migration does not  impact other applications.  Please approve it and 
forward
it to Margaret Waters mail box.    

Margaret,
Per your instruction, these are things we need for this migration.

1. Delete view rms_basis_nymex_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms
2. Create new view view rms_basis_nymex_partial_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and 
ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms
3. Modify  the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull 
from the new view
4. Migrate stored procedures 
    mchen.up_TWDA_create_path
    mchen.up_TWDA_deal_analysis
    in etstest/twprod01 to dbo in etstest/twprod01, etsmo/twprod01, and 
mojo/twprod01.
    Grant exec to developers in etstest.
    Grant exec to TWDP in etsmo and mojo. 

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

Mei-Ling,

I put the index table on ETSTEST.twprod01, ETSMO.twprod01, and MOJO.twprod01 
and I have added a job to refresh the new table in production.  In 
development (ETSHOUSD11.GPGRMS) I have dropped the view rms_basis_nymex_view 
and created a new view  rms_basis_nymex_partial_view.  I have also loaded the 
data to ETSTEST.twprod01.  After you have tested and when you request the 
migration, please request the deletion of the view rms_basis_nymex_view on 
ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms and the creation of the new view in these 
two environments.  Also request the modification of the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO 
misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull from the new view.

Please send the request directly to my mail box, I will complete and send to 
the ETS DBA mailbox as completed.

Margaret

Yes, I need the same logic for "NYMEX" like the attached query.  For NYMEX, 
and the four new TW index,
I only need the most current data for the application. 

Thanks,

Meiling,

Do you want the same logic you have in the attached query for the "NYMEX" 
also or like the current NYMEX selection do you want everything and you 
filter the most current?

Also for the future, creation of new tables require a database change form.

Thanks,

Margaret

Margaret ,

The basis differential for TW is available in rms database now, I like to 
request a nightly download
from rms database to twprod01 database in etstest/etsmo/mojo.
You set up NYMEX price dowload to rms_basis for me ealier.
Since there are more than one type of index coming in this time, I think we 
also need rms_index in
Sybase side.

Attached is the sample sql from Ray Volpone.



Thanks,
Mei-Ling

Some of you have had problems with this months newsletter - sorry.  The 
system we normally use to create it on was down and even though this one was 
compatible with the group I test with, it did not work well with everyone.  
If you have trouble viewing or printing the format, or just prefer another 
format, I have 2 other versions I can send you.  Just reply to this note or 
call me at 713-853-3986.  If the majority have problems and another version 
works, I'll resend it to the whole group.  For the moment, I'll keep working 
one-on-one.  

Thanks,
Donna

Michelle,
Our True-Quote rep is Kelly Stroud at 713-350-1008.  If Jim wants to call
her to find out some info, he can tell her he got the number from Calpine.
I have only met Kelly Stroud a couple of times and she will remember me
because I was taking motorcycle classes when I met her and she used to ride
bikes.
Good Luck

The Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system is now open through Friday,=
=20
Nov. 17, for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback.  Th=
is=20
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback.

Management, when determining performance ratings, participating in PRC=20
meetings, and providing feedback to employees, depends on the comments=20
received via PEP.  For the users of PEP information to fully understand the=
=20
employee=01,s performance and the ratings identified, specific comments are=
=20
needed to explain each rating, including the overall rating.  It's most=20
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their=20
action was productive or why it needs improvement.

Comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improveme=
nt=20
are both important.  Just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to=20
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits, we also need to know what a=
nd=20
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors.  We all benefit from=20
constructive feedback.

Please actively participate in the year-end PEP process and make your input=
=20
meaningful.

PEP Feedback Tips:
? Provide feedback when requested.
? Rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year.
? Provide specific comments with specific examples.
? Indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate.

	ETS Intranet Consolidation Project Updates (www.ETS.enron.com)
What is the status of the consolidation?

Completed Sites:
The core ETS Intranet Site, www.ets.enron.com
ETS Solution Center 
http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.htm
Self-Directed Task Force http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/SDWT/default.htm

Sites in Progress:
Safety Site http://www.ots.enron.com/safety/default.htm
Design and Records Management
Engineering Standards http://www.ots.enron.com/docs/stds/0000-1.htm

How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, 
any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message 
requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content or applications 
on the current ETS website (www.ots.enron.com)
to discuss the migration.  All content and applications on this web server 
will be moved to the new ETS Intranet before the end of the 2nd quarter.

Questions
LaDonna Dervin is the project manager for the project and can be reached at 
713.853.7103 if you have any questions regarding the project.

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:

Important Instructions for Sending in Expense Reports:

?	Prepare your expense report. 

?	Once completed, click on the print button at the top. 

?	A box requesting you to select the appropriate type of report will be displayed.  Select either Receipt Report or Detail Report based on the following specifications:

1.	Receipt Report - This report must be printed and sent to accounting. This report has a bar code on it that is needed for the accounting department to scan in your report. It also tells you which receipts must be sent in with the receipt report. 

2.	Detail Report - Do not send this report to accounting (it has no bar code).  This report is more appropriate for the traveler or the person that prepares the report in case they would like to keep a paper copy. 


?	Once you have printed the receipt report and attached the receipts, you must send all expense reports in the white A/P envelope with the open slot at the right hand corner (the bar code must be seen through this slot). 


**If you follow these instructions when sending in your expense reports, the receipts will be scanned much more quickly.  If you do not use the correct envelope or do not send the correct report, it will significantly slow down the process.

Michelle,
I left a message on your voice mail about the use of TW Deal Profitability and TW Deal Analysis.  Is anyone in Marketing still using these applications?  We are looking to stop the support of the applications if there are no users.

Thank you,
