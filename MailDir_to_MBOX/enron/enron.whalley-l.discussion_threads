Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! 
(details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many 
eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced 
web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from 
leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums 
(coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which 
Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there 
may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level 
discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for 
the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions 
among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and 
other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for 
new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor 
participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate 
executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a 
high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and 
corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to 
DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels 
above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is 
intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity 
in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work 
from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, 
references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in 
this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and 
other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and 
participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very 
frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded 
our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there 
someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, 
interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you 
involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the 
time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to 
participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an "Enron 
brain drain" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate 
concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly 
to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable 
telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the 
WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at 
other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the "From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Kristin,

Per Greg Whalley, we need to install the Executive Report Viewer on Dave 
Delainey's computer.  He should have access to everything that Whalley has.  
Approval, for now, will remain with Whalley.  Greg would like this taken care 
of ASAP.

Many Thanks,

Liz

Subject: Wartsila USA

Richard,

This is the e-mail you forwarded back in February.  I have chased up all of 
the guys in the US and here's the scoop:

ENA
Spoke with Bob Virgo who is a John Chappell equivalent, working for Dave Duran
They looked hard at the Wartsila engines back in March and concluded that it 
would not work due to emissions problems - they were considering the sites 
from all over the US
They haven't spoken with Wartsila for over a month
No wonder why Dave Duran hasn't rushed to call me back

EES
Spoke with Jeff Golden who is VP Corporate Development and acting as deal 
leader for distributed generation projects
They have spoken with Wartsila only generally about a deal
EES is trying to create optionality for its originators by pre-permitting 
some sites in New Mexico (x 2), Arizona (x 2) and Nevada (x 5)
Each site would be suited for 10 - 50 MW... therefore 70 - 350 MW total
They looked at a 2-4 year lease option with Wartsila starting this summer but 
it likely won't happen - can't get the sites permitted in time
Jeff didn't think there was anything that would cause Wartsila to conclude 
that the US deal was immenent
Jeff was interested in co-ordinating our efforts and wants to discuss the 
merits of a global deal - I will be sending him a copy of our Wartsila term 
sheet

Spoke with Mark Dobler who is VP Operations
confirmed that Jeff is the man to talk to in EES
sentiment in EES is that they are no big time bullish about getting into 
physical positions to cover off California - thinks the Sol Cal Edison credit 
problem will be solved by the government
heard that one of the EES guys in Brazil (Tony Spruill) is looking at 
generation to cover off some positions - another potential for a global deal

Conclusion
>From Enron USA's perspective there is no burning deal for Wartsila kit

Interesting feedback considering this morning's conversation...

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Re: Mobile DG Sets  

We are in negotiations with Wartsila, a maker of 3MW gas recip engines, that 
gives us access to up to 700MW of engines over a 5 year time frame (including 
some very nice optionality).  An important feature is that we think we can 
mark to market the tolling contracts.

Chris Thrall is the lead originator on the deal, which still has some 
significant hurdles to overcome.  My intention is to get this deal done, then 
bring North America in to the equation.  
Wartsila are a counterparty with great potential, but can be flakey, and 
therefore need to be handled carefully.  I will ask Chris to give you a call 
later today.

Richard -  

I was referred to you by Dan Leff, who asked me to touch base on some mobile 
power sets you are deploying in the UK.  He indicated the number to be qty 70 
10MW units.

I have the same task here in the US, specifically to take advantage of the 
power shortage occurring 2-3Q 2001, in multiple markets.

If you are the right contact person, can we talk on 12 Feb?  I can be reached

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These 
investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private 
equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments 
unit.

This new group will report to an investment committee consisting of Greg 
Whalley, Ken Rice, and Dave Delainey.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in 
this effort.

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the amount currently withheld under the Federal 
withholding tax regime, all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of taxes 
that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 or 600 
"tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  The 
attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The second Bombay High Court hearing was held today.  The court asked DPC to 
go away for a week and try to continue discussions with MSEB.  The parties 
are to return to the court in a week for another hearing.  We are not 
entirely sure why the court made this request -- it has nothing to do with 
the MERC jurisdiction issue before the court.  One possible positive 
interpretation:  The court feels the need to generate some positive publicity 
("I tried to encourage a positive outcome") before ruling in our favor on the 
jurisdiction issue.  But, again, the court's motives are not clear.

We still don't know if some or all of the lenders will try to cure the 
construction contract defaults this week.  I would expect that we would 
receive formal termination letters over the weekend from the contractors if 
the contractors are not paid in full this week.  

Some of you are aware that DPC's relationship with its Indian outside counsel 
has recently shown some strain.  That strain did not affect the quality of 
DPC's representation at the Bombay High Court hearing.  However, I'm also 
pretty sure that the strain has not been permanently "fixed" and that further 
efforts will be required in this regard.  Gail Brownfeld and Jim McCartney 
are helping DPC with these issues.

Bruce

Greg

I was talking with George Wasaff yesterday and he recommended I touch base 
with you in an effort to identify potential Enron interest in acquiring 
WaterDesk assets.

WaterDesk Corp.  was incubated by Azurix  to provide participants in the 
global water industry with a global, single-source, collaborative, 
business-to-business network to efficiently source, transact and manage, 
information, products and services.  We are currently involved in a private 
placement process that does portend some significant possibility for success 
but has not had anyone circle an offer yet.  Time is of the essence.  Given 
current market and industry realities, our priorities have changed in an 
effort to maximize near term opportunity for success. Specifically, in 
addition to offering investors the opportunity to invest in a public 
marketplace solution, we are pursuing other avenues, such as private 
marketplace or buy-side procurement solutions (which seem to be more 
palatable).  We are also broadening our opportunity set by seeking potential 
solutions outside the water industry. Feedback from the various and numerous 
entities that have performed due diligence on WaterDesk  indicate that its 
assets are well suited for any of these alternative solutions.

KEY ELEMENTS OF VALUE:  a qualified and experienced team; intellectual 
property; and, a secure, integrated and operational platform.  

Bottom Line: I have committed to John Garrison that we will deliver some form 
of success by February or we should "pull the plug".  It would be a pity to

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These 
investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private 
equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments 
unit.

This new group will report to an investment committee consisting of Greg 
Whalley, Ken Rice, and Dave Delainey.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in 
this effort.

Last Tuesday Global Finance Europe closed  a new off balance sheet facility 
with Barclays creating up to $1bn of capacity for existing and new physical 
metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines    

Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort

Kiodex Appoints Two New Members to Senior Management
  11/14/2000 

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 14, 2000-- Kiodex Inc., a provider of 
technology-based trading and risk-management solutions for the commodities 
markets, recently added two new members to its senior management team: Raj 
Vaswani, Vice President and General Counsel and Thomas Farley, Chief 
Financial Officer. Mr. Vaswani will develop and manage the company's legal 
and regulatory strategies. Mr. Farley will manage the company's finance and 
accounting functions. 

"Having worked with countless high-flying technology companies, Kiodex 
impresses me as being the cream of the crop," said Vaswani. " Kiodex is 
without peer in its vision to deliver risk management and trading services to 
the marketplace."

Raj Vaswani comes to Kiodex from Morrison & Foerster LLP in New York, one of 
the leading new-media law firms, where he was an attorney in the Technology 
Transactions Group and specialized in corporate and intellectual property 
transactions for high-technology companies, including public equity 
offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and software-development transactions. 
Recently profiled in the New York Law Journal, Mr. Vaswani is a well-regarded 
attorney in the field of new media and has authored numerous articles 
regarding the legal aspects of emerging high-technology businesses. 

Thomas Farley joins Kiodex from Gryphon Investors, an investment firm 
specializing in leveraged acquisitions of and growth equity investments in 
high-growth, middle-market companies. Mr. Farley found and evaluated 
acquisition candidates, executed transactions, monitored investment 
portfolios, and directly supplemented the management of several portfolio 
companies. Previously, Mr. Farley worked for Montgomery Securities (now Banc 
of America Securities) where he was a corporate finance investment banker 
advising high-growth middle- and large-market companies. 

" Kiodex compares favorably to the many early-stage technology companies that 
I worked with previously," noted Farley. "The company's position as a 
nuts-and-bolts technology provider with a proprietary solution and a superb 
management team made my decision to join the company an easy one." 
"We are thrilled at these two new additions to our management team at Kiodex 
. Their decision to join us marks our transition to a new stage of growth," 
stated R. Martin Chavez, CEO. "The high-tech expertise Mr. Vaswani gained 
while at Morrison & Foerster makes him the ideal leader of our legal and 
regulatory strategies; moreover, Raj has been with us as outside counsel 
since the inception of Kiodex . Tom, with his hands-on experience at 
Gryphon's portfolio companies, will plan our path to profitability and embed 
planning, budgeting, and forecasting into our DNA at Kiodex ."

Web-based CHEMCONNECT corrals top U.S. petrochemical broker

11/13/2000 
Oxy-Fuel News 
(c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 

The world's largest Internet-based exchange for petrochemicals and industrial 
gases, ChemConnect Inc., snapped up leading traditional U.S. brokerage firm, 
Universal Chemical Brokerage Ltd. (UCB) last week. At the same time, 
ChemConnect announced the launch of its World Chemical Exchange commodities 
trading floor.

Plans are to integrate New York-based UCB?a dominant player in U.S. spot 
market petrochemical brokering that places traditional broker trades by 
phone?with ChemConnect's Internet trading service. The move will enable UCB 
to help clients online or offline on the new Commodities Floor of the World 
Chemical Exchange, allowing them to post their own buy or sell offers either 
electronically or offline through brokers.

The new Commodities Floor will allow pre-qualified members to buy, sell and 
exchange standard high volume commodity products over the Internet in real 
time through trading hubs in Antwerp-Rotterdam, Singapore and Houston. 
Established trading pits include methanol and MTBE as well as several other 
petrochemicals.

The Commodities Floor offers more than $1 billion/yr in notional sales value, 
while the addition of UCB immediately gives the floor added trading liquidity 
for petrochemicals, said the company. "ChemConnect intends to further expand 
its capacity, reach and services to include the development of financial 
derivatives market."

NetworkOil's SurplusExchange sets fast pace 

HOUSTON, Nov. 13 (LocalBusiness.com) -- NetworkOil Inc. today announced its 
Surplus Exchange has sold $20 million worth of oilfield equipment since it 
was launched three months ago, which an analyst from the Yankee Group calls a 
"pretty good" volume for the energy exchange arena. 

"NetworkOil is a pretty big player in its niche market," Randall Nottingham, 
senior analyst of the Yankee Group's energy and Internet strategies practice, 
told LocalBusiness.com during a telephone interview from his Boston office 
today. The Yankee Group is a technology research and consulting service. 

He estimated a market "in the hundreds of millions of dollars" annually for 
the auctioning of used or surplus industrial equipment, adding that he had no 
figures available on the size of the market specifically for the oil and gas 
industry. 

The NetworkOil Surplus Exchange uses the Internet to enhance market liquidity 
for the sellers of surplus equipment in the oil and natural gas industry. It 
also exposes the equipment to potential buyers globally, giving them better 
knowledge of what is available on the market, Nottingham said. 

"Sellers are reaching more buyers through the SurplusExchange and maximizing 
the realized value of their assets," Stuart Page, NetworkOil CEO said in a 
news release. "NetworkOil is addressing business needs, and the oil and gas 
industry is responding." 

Nottingham said NetworkOil uses both the Internet auction and the traditional 
auction in its business model. "It's not the E-Bay model of showing a picture 
and expecting people to bid on it." He praised Network Oil's acquisition in 
August of the San Antonio-based Premier Auctioneers International. 

Since then, NetworkOil and Premier Auctioneers have conducted eight live 
call-out auctions and four Internet auctions. The SurplusExchange currently 
lists more than $50 million of oilfield equipment. 

Twenty sales professions work directly with sellers to take an inventory of 
the equipment and conduct appraisals, and they also conduct equipment 
searchers for buyers. 

"Selling equipment through NetworkOil Surplus Exchange exceeded our 
expectations," said David Sims, materials manager of Kerr-McGee Corp. in

Two local firms in marketing pact
Nov 14, 2000 02:06 PM ET 

HOUSTON, Nov. 14 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Two local online sites focusing on 
the energy industry today said they have signed a joint marketing to enlarge 
their offerings and expand audiences. 

The Oil & Gas Journal Exchange's Global Equipment Exchange, a trading 
exchange for new and used equipment, said it will work with FlashFind Corp., 
which offers technical operational, repair and safety information at its 
site. 

"In many cases manuals and other product documentation are lost during the 
life of the equipment," said Dehorah Peppers, chairman of FlashFind. 

Peppers said Oil & Gas Journal Exchange customers will be able to buy 
equipment and "be sure that they will have access to all the documentation 
needed to operate and maintain it." 

Founded in 1997, FlashFind also provides links to a number of ecommerce and 
procurement systems and research services. 

For Oil & Gas Exchange, the agreement simply increases the amount of content 
available to customers shopping for equipment. 

Global Equipment Exchange, formerly Global Logistics Partners, was acquired 
by San Mateo, Calif.-based pennNET in March. The company has been trading new 
and surplus oilfield and electric power equipment since 1991. PennNET was 
created to electronically leverage the resources of Tulsa, Okla.-based 
PennWell Corp.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

WoodFuel.com allies with Future Energy 
HOUSTON, Dec. 6 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Houston-based WoodFuel.com has teamed 
up with Atlanta's Future Energy Resources Corp. to supply raw wood materials 
that are targeted to fire up environmentally friendly power plants in Texas. 
The power-generating stations would use Future Energy's SilvaGas process, 
which converts agricultural, municipal and forestry wastes into a 
clean-burning gas that substitutes for natural gas. 
The process is designed to significantly reduce environmental impact compared 
to fossil fuel-based power plants, including the elimination of net carbon 
dioxide emissions, the company said. 
"Texas regulations and energy demands make Texas an ideal location for green 
energy," said Asfaha Tesfai, senior VP of business development for Future 
Energy. "This alliance will ensure sufficient fuel availability to proceed 
with project development." 
In August, Future Energy operated its SilvaGas process on a commercial scale 
at a demonstration plant in Burlington, Vt., which converted more than 285 
tons of wood chips into enough of natural gas substitute to power 6,000 
homes. 
The private company designed and built the plant in partnership with the U.S. 
Department of Energy, which provided technical assistance and funding for 
facility construction, and the Burlington Electric Department. 
Future Energy now is working to develop relationships, such as its alliance 
with WoodFuel.com, that would help it commercialize the process. 
Privately held WoodFuel.com is a business-to-business, e-commerce company 
that links buyers and suppliers of raw wood material online. The company 
aggregates wood fuel from its network of suppliers and delivers the wood as a 
renewable energy resource. 
Since its April launch, WoodFuel.com said it has created a total of 283 new 
accounts and sold 15,845 tons of wood fuel.

Clearinghouse puts pieces in place for 2001

12/05/2000 
Gas Daily 

Over-the-counter (OTC) energy clearinghouse EnergyClear moved one step closer 
to its planned 2001 launch, choosing onExchange's technology platform for 
EnergyClear's online trading system.

OnExchange, which works with electronic exchanges to add risk-management 
capabilities for their customers, said EnergyClear initially will offer its 
services to traders in the wholesale gas and power markets. As early as next 
spring - once the system comes online - it will provide centralized 
comparison, netting and settlement of OTC energy contracts for trades 
executed over the phone or through electronic marketplaces, onExchange says.

EnergyClear Co-founder and President Lee Burton said the implementation of 
onExchange technology satisfies a long-standing need in the OTC markets, 
while providing other benefits as well. "The OTC markets have been seeking 
the efficiencies of multilateral clearing for some time now and, in 
conjunction with . . . onExchange, EnergyClear offers the first neutral, 
independent, unbiased clearing solution," Burton said.

OTC energy contracts currently are negotiated between principals, via 
electronic exchanges or through interdealer brokers over the telephone. 
Future markets planned for the clearinghouse include petroleum products, 
crude oil, petrochemicals and bandwidth.

With the deal, EnergyClear becomes onExchange's first customer. Terms of the 
deal were not disclosed.

IDC analyst Aaron McPherson suggested a bright future for EnergyClear. 
"Online forwards and derivatives trading and clearing solutions typically 
deliver a five- to 10-fold increase in trading volume over underlying cash 
markets. These solutions will improve the overall efficiency of the energy 
market, allow energy companies to manage their risk much more effectively and 
increase liquidity."

Houston-based EnergyClear is comprised of EnergyClear Corp. and EnergyClear 
Operations Co. (EOC). EOC is owned by the Bank of New York, Prebon Yamane and 
Amerex. CH

The votes have been counted.  We won.  Thank you for your support.  The 2000 
election should be over.  But because the Democrats are trying to rewrite the 
rules, the fight continues.  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney urgently need 
your help.  To contribute immediately, see form below.

The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to 
other closely contested states.  We are confident of victory, but we need 
your help.

George W. Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast 
ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of the 
Electoral College.

All the Democrat maneuvering -- in the courts, in the streets, on television 
-- is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing 
the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can 
count thousands of improper ballots.

We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election.  The RNC has sent staff to 
Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and 
Wisconsin as well.  We are fighting a multi-front war, and it is expensive.  
These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted -- and they come at a time when the 
RNC's resources have been depleted by the election.  That's why I'm asking 
for your help again today.

I've included two articles - Charles Krauthammer's November 17 column, and 
excerpts from a Los Angeles Times report -- that describe how the Democrats 
are waging this battle.   I hope you'll take time to read them -- they are 
revealing, and they emphasize how high the stakes are in this contest.

Again, I would ask you to read the articles below - and then do four 
important things for our country:

1) send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your friends and 
neighbors who care about this country and want the truth to come out in 
Florida

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. You can get the addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of 
your elected Congress people and Senators at 
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/

3) call your local talk radio show or TV news show and let them know your 
strong views on this issue

4) write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on this important subject


Al Gore lost on November 7.  He is now seeking to reverse the results of the 
election in court.  This is an outrage -- and it is a sad day for our 
country. We will fight this battle with all the available means at our 
disposal.  Please help as generously as you can. See below how to contribute 
online, or send your contribution to:

Republican National Committee
310 First Street S.E.
Washington, D.C.  20003

Thank you.

Sincerely,


Jim Nicholson

Not by Hand
By Charles Krauthammer

     There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many 
other states to count ballots. The reason is not only speed and efficiency 
but fairness. Of course machines make mistakes, but the mistakes are 
distributed randomly. There is no premeditation, no search for advantage.
     Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were 
double-punched, under-punched or otherwise spoiled in Florida. But machines 
read such errors with scrupulous impartiality. The same cannot be said of 
hand counting. Hand counting is arbitrary, open to manipulation and abuse.
Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines, not humans. When 
humans try, the results, as we have seen in Palm Beach, range from the 
arbitrary to the bizarre. Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners 
holding up cards to the light, trying to divine the intent of voters. Hence 
the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare 
that "dimpled chads"--a slight indentation in the piece of paper one is 
supposed to punch through, even slighter than the now legendary "pregnant 
chad"--must be counted as a vote.
     Second, a manual recount subjects computer cards, literally, to 
manipulation. Under this method, the presidency of the United States hangs by 
a thread, the thread holding the dangling chad. Any waving, shuffling, 
rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread, dislodge the chad, and 
produce a "vote."
     This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly 
neutral. They are not. The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats: 
The counties now seeking to conduct these recounts--Palm Beach and 
Broward--are controlled by Democrats. The decision regarding the legality of 
every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or 
majority Democratic.
     These counties, moreover, are two of the most heavily Democratic in the 
state. They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon 
Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in 1964--and that was the biggest landslide 
of our time. Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether 
to recount the entire county: Two of the test districts voted 20 to 1 for 
Gore, the third 50 to 1. Brezhnev never did that well.
     In such heavily Democratic districts, there is no way a recount will not 
produce more net votes for Gore. You simply expand or narrow your criteria 
for voter "intent"--and produce whatever number you need to win.
What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida? 
The fairest is a statewide machine count--and recount. Why? Because the 
errors balance out.
     What about a statewide manual recount, an option offered by Gore in his 
televised Nov. 15 gambit? It has two disabling liabilities. First, it vastly 
multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias. Thousands of people in 
thousands of precincts handling millions of cards--cards that can be 
manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease. There just aren't enough 
watchdogs to watch all the partisans.

See the full article at http://www.washingtonpost.com/


SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA

Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times:

"To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with 
tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line 
and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to 
outdo their opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue... 
"Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of  AFL-CIO 
staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco and elsewhere had  disembarked to learn how to observe the 
ballot count.  "'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new 
charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.'  The volunteers  nodded. 'It's 
very, very important that if you see any kind of mark--a scratch, a dent, a 
pinprick in Al Gore's column--that you challenge.'   When someone then asked 
what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer 
said: 'Keep your lips sealed.'  It was hardball that the Bostonians and other 
importe!
d pros understood well."

***********************************************************************

Dear Echampion,

The situation in Florida is an outrage.  And it is getting worse.  The RNC 
urgently needs your help today.

Over the weekend, Al Gore's campaign has waged an all-out effort to 
disqualify military absentee ballots and almost succeeded in throwing out 
over 1400 in all.  Military absentees were running heavily in favor of 
Governor Bush - so they became a "shoot-to-kill" target for win-at-all-costs 
Democrat operatives.

The articles below, one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York 
Post, amply demonstrate this "Democratic vote scheme."

The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide.  A leaked five 
page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details -- precise instructions to 
Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on 
technicalities.  And as the ballots were counted in one county, the Chicago 
Sun Times source noted:

"Gore had five attorneys there.  Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote.  Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter.  They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality."

Such tactics are shameful.  This has been an exceptionally close election.  
On Election Day, George W. Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast 
and counted ballots in Florida and, with Florida's 25 electors, a majority of 
the Electoral College.

Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting 
Democrat judges to rewrite Florida's election laws after the fact to permit 
partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots.  That is 
bad enough -- but to selectively target our men and women in uniform purely 
in order to knock out a few hundred more votes for George Bush is beneath 
contempt.

We URGENTLY need your help today!  Please:

1) Make as generous a contribution as you can to the RNC's Fair Elections 
Fund, by following this link:

truth to come out in Florida

This battle SHOULD be over.  George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won on November 
7.  But because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, the fight goes on.  
Please help the RNC give Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney the support they 
need.

Democrats' vote scheme
November 20, 2000
BY ROBERT NOVAK SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST
WASHINGTON--It was 4:30 a.m. in Jacksonville, Fla., Saturday when two 
Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each 
other. The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee 
ballots of 44 U.S. service personnel. Their defect: no postmarks.

The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by 
Republicans, an irony reflective of the fight for Florida. Befuddled 
Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats, following the letter of the 
law. Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win 
Florida--and the presidency. While granting maximum latitude in divining 
intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast, the 
predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country 
abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude.
When Al Gore and George W. Bush finished in a Florida dead heat, Republicans 
viewed it like a normal recount. Democrats, in contrast, treated it like a 
continuation of the 2000 campaign.

Gore's operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic. They 
calculated that the 300-vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine 
recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gore's deficit 
on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed 1,000 votes. The Gore campaign 
worked to make sure that did not happen.

Mark Herron, a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the 
Gore campaign legal effort, last Wednesday sent off a five-page letter to 
colleagues around the state addressed to "FDP (Florida Democratic Party) 
Lawyer." The subject: "Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest." It 
amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the serviceman's vote.

It worked. In Jacksonville, officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft 
carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a 
postmark. Consequently, plenty of sailors lost their vote at 4:30 Saturday 
morning (including, for example, Donnie Haynes, Michael Gentry and Clifford 
Shearer from the USS George Washington).

Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at 11:30 p.m. Friday 
after seven and one-half hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this 
memo:
"Gore had five attorneys there. Their sole objective was to disenfranchise 
the military absentee votes. They challenged each and every vote. Their sole 
intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter. They constantly 
challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate, but they were able to 
disqualify them on a technicality."

In Broward County, 92 overseas ballots were accepted and 304 rejected. In 
Miami-Dade County, 110 out of 113 were turned down. Statewide, 2,203 ballots 
were accepted and 1,420 rejected. As a result, Bush's net overseas gain was 
only 630, for an overall Florida lead of 930.

That meant only 930 votes need be won by Gore in the hand-counting of heavily 
Democratic Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. They were working 
hard at it. David Fulcher, a lawyer from Jackson, Miss., sent to Palm Beach 
to help out, described to me a scene of chaos and confusion--of Bush ballots 
put in the Gore pile, followed by protests and arguments.

It became clear at midweek, however, that Palm Beach would not yield enough 
new Gore votes. Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in 
Broward and Miami-Dade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand 
recounts. But late Saturday, when Gore planners became concerned about 
surpassing the 930-vote margin in the three counties, the rules were suddenly 
changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who 
failed to make a hole in the punch card.

THE FLORIDA CIRCUS: HAS AL NO DECENCY?
John Podhoretz
The New York Post
Sunday,November 19,2000

IF the "butterfly ballot" in Florida's Palm Beach County had led to the 
disqualification of 40 percent of the county's presidential votes, 
Republicans wouldn't be protesting the manual recount there. There would have 
been no question in everyone's mind that some combination of ballot 
irregularity, manipulation and outright fraud had taken place. But only 5 
percent of the Palm Beach ballots were invalidated.

It now appears that 40 percent of Florida's overseas ballots have been 
invalidated. Democrats are convinced that their outrage on behalf of Al Gore 
and his position as the supposedly "true" winner of Florida is justified 
largely because of the furor that arose on the day after the election from 
the butterfly-ballot controversy.

How do they feel, today, knowing that - let me say it again, and in bold-face 
type: Forty percent of Florida's overseas ballots have been invalidated?

It also appears that most of those invalidated votes came from enlistees in 
the U.S. military as the result of a coordinated Democratic strategy designed 
by Tallahassee lawyer Mark Herron, who is involved in various Gore voter 
lawsuits.

Here's what this means: Al Gore, who is by all accounts totally and 
intimately involved in every aspect of the process underway in Florida, may 
well have approved an effort to challenge every absentee vote in Florida cast 
by the servicemen and servicewomen whose commander-in-chief he will become if 
he is sworn in as president.

I have no doubt that the challenges are legal. Florida tightened its 
absentee-vote procedures after massive fraud in 1998 led to the illegitimate 
election of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez - whom a judge removed from office when 
the extent of his campaign's grave offense against the U.S. electoral system 
became clear.

Republicans, who have been hewing to the letter of the law in making their 
argument against the hand recounts in four Democratic counties, are not 
exactly in a position to argue for greater leniency on these military 
ballots. Such an affirmative-action claim would make a mockery of George W. 
Bush's own argument in federal court that the hand count violates the 14th 
amendment's equal-protection clause.
But the Gore campaign's conduct makes an even greater mockery of the vice 
president's insistence on a "full, fair and accurate count." Again - this 
cannot be said often enough - 40 percent of the overseas and absentee ballots 
have been invalidated as a direct result of a Democratic strategy intended to 
benefit the vice president.

Republicans will be falling all over themselves to accuse the vice president 
of "hypocrisy," which is becoming the most tiresome game of this 
post-election season. Let me stipulate that there is indeed hypocrisy on both 
sides.
The real issue in the matter of the absentee ballots is the very deep and 
very, very dark cynicism of Gore's efforts to make himself president. In 
pursuit of this ambition imprinted on him at birth, Al Gore really is willing 
to do just about anything.

The vice president has now proved himself capable of actively seeking the 
disenfranchisement of military voters out of fear that they might have voted 
for his rival (the challenges had to be issued before the envelopes were 
opened). None of those Florida residents can now be sure that his or her vote 
was ever counted.

Thanks.

Let me know when the contract comes in for the API, how it looks and what the 
voyeur charge is.

Get us on whatever panel they come up with on mid/back office.  Who should 
sit on this panel?

You and I have discussed the clearing thing and our doubts about clearing for 
everyone, etc.

What were the next steps or meetings you discussed with him?

Subject: ICE

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour 
and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on 
where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test 
environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect 
it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that 
all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or 
provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to 
pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. 
They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his 
vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared 
and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. 
In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving 
money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why 
not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to 
participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back 
ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

To all:

We continue to make progress on the EPP (electronic payment platform)
and are we are actually testing some modules internally.  The market
continues to migrate toward our space, which hopefully means there will be a
greater
understanding of what our system can do.  The existing 1.2 trillion dollar
market is possibly bigger than we thought.  We are having conversations with
several Fortune 500 companies who do non-cash trading in an effort to
ascertain the size of each of their current markets.

We are heavily involved in our current raise of 5 MM.  While we
are in discussions with a few organizations, we would be interested in
speaking with anyone who has an interest in a large market, experienced
management
team, closed loop settlement platform, and a company with "HIDDEN VALUE".
So if you are aware of either angels with $100,000 or more to invest or
seed or start-up VC's who can bring $5 Million to the table, let us know.

In today's market it is often difficult to determine true value in a
corporation, much less the hidden value.  This "hidden" value is often
called "IP" or Intellectual Property.  On that front, the good news for us
is; We own our Intellectual Property!  Why is this important you may ask?

Well, a business associate of mine at a company called Neo Media (NEOM) just
recently signed a 100 MILLION DOLLAR PLUS licensing agreement for their
suite of patents.  This is extremely encouraging as the market NEOM is in is
dwarfed in comparison to the global trade market where our IP is based.  We
have been very diligent in filing the IP documents and the attorney's have
issued a letter of opinion stating the validity and defensibility of our
claims.

This should prove extremely valuable as we move forward in building the
company.  As other competitors attempt to move into our space, they will
bump up against <the> our patents.  This will pose tremendous licensing
opportunities for GBUCs and 2Xchange. A very interesting point within the
NEOM agreement is the "NON-EXCLUSIVE" nature of the license.
Congratulations to all at NEOM, and thank you for paving the way for
corporations like ours.

Hi Christie,

I hope all is well with you.
Last week I sent you a FedEx with the EnronOnline case in its final version
for your information and was wondering if you received it.
I also enclosed our green release card for Louise Kitchen's
signature.  (Our case records people need  Louise's sign-off on the case
since she's the protagonist.)  I hope you won't mind passing the green card
to Louise for her signature.

As always, thank you so much for your help!
Best,
Meg
PS Everybody loves the Enron cases, and it looks like they will become
bestsellers soon!

Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting.  
I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I 
strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team 
on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and 
financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. 
Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent

I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are 
not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.

Thanks

Regards
Delainey

Dave,

I am sorry that I was unable to meet with you yesterday on Cuiba.  Jim has 
told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.  Below is a note 
that I received this morning from Pete.  The meeting he is referencing is an 
indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.  You are more than 
welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know.

I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree 
that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking 
either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.  I would be happy to discuss with you 
why I recommend one of those two individuals.

Subject: Cuiaba I Team

the list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if 
the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it 
ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and 
some of the full time guys should take a back seat.

I would have the full time dedicated team be - 

Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he 
negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory 
system does and does not work.

Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right 
contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian 
resistance.  Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant.

John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit 
- has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be 
rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire 
project is wired together.

Rob Gay - Finance 

Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is 
producing 300 mw of power which is being sold and paid for.

Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -  he is relatively new to 
the project and seems satisfactory

Would recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line 
negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review 
overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. 

Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time.

Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting 
point - new deal.  Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get 
Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.    You 
will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months 
to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just 
financial close achieved.

This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his 
ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead 
developer - but has had lots of "help" from Bannantine and the entire team.   
Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.  I am not sure 
anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were 
some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight  - and some 
things that can be done better now.  The things that come be done better now 
- I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.  People need 
to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult 
to "take over" the project without making some changes in the way it is being 
run.   

For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present -

Rick Lammers
Laine Powell
Jose Bestard

Also in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and 
myself.

The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know 
if you would like him there.

You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy 
- just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and 
then straight to a listing of all things that need to get done to "finish" 
the project to the point where we have financial close and a functioning 
supply and PPA.

Joe and I and Rob will be in Houston and the rest of the team will dial in a 
conference call. 

Let me know if the above format is ok.

Pete

Rich/Chad:

Check-out the following research piece from SSB on Dynergy, particularly the
section "Key Progress in Establishing Bandwidth Trading Platform".  My
question is this: SSB states the "Enron model" is built on pooling points
while Dynergy's strategy relies on "metro-hubs", which connect existing
points of presence in metropolitan areas.  Is this legit or BS, i.e. does
this analyst know what he talking about?

Thanks,

Peter

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE ALAMAC/AIG TRANSACTION!! Fantastic 
effort and job well done from beginning to end! I don't remember the other 
folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have 
happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last 
July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a 
little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire 
transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an 
incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to 
"broker" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!! 
Pretty awesome.

This was really a great job by all! Let me know the date of the celebration 
dinner!

Greg , as I mentioned in my earlier note , we have had a team crawling all 
over the Margaux transaction both to see if we can reduce the outrageous cost 
and also to see if we can find some earnings . We don't have your earnings 
meeting today and I am not sure yet if it is going to be later in the week ( 
when I am out of the office ) so I thought I would give you a heads up on a 
deal we are working on . It is early days and there are some significant 
accounting and timing issues , but we believe that we have found a way to 
reduce our cost's going forward and recognise potentially up to $100million 
of earnings . In brief this will be by unwinding a liability in respect of an 
existing swap  for about $100m less than it will cost to settle the swap and 
pay out the third party debt and equity holders and pay breakage costs . It 
will involve us in taking back some incremental risk and in taking approx 
$230m of debt on balance sheet -I believe this is all manageable . In 
addition the transaction will require third party consents which could take 
time , however we are aiming to close Q2 . We will brief Glisan and Causey 
today as we need some support from them on a couple of issues . This is not 
yet above a 50% probabilty but I am hopeful that this is doable . We will 
keep you informed .
Michael

Here are just a few of today's headlines (see attachment for full stories):

* It was a $5 billion day at EnronOnline:  Think back to the birth of 
EnronOnline
a year ago.  Enron CEO Kenneth Lay told us here that he and Skilling didn't 
hear
about that venture until it was about to be launched although lower level 
managers
had 300 people working on the plan...

* DSL server down?  Listen to this:  Imagine.  For a couple days recently, 
Restructuring
Today's DSL server went dead...

* Enron's Skilling sees utilities breaking into independents:  Enron President
Jeffrey Skilling predicts vertically integrated utilities won't be getting 
bigger
-- merger trends notwithstanding -- but will fragment into many independent 
companies...

* New Power to get PECO 300,000:  It was a friendlier moment -- except for 
Green
Mountain Energy -- yesterday as the Pennsylvania PUC voted to transfer nearly
300,000 PECO customers to New Power Co...

* Enron to be world's #1 bandwidth trader:  Enron intends being the world's 
largest
bandwidth trader, President Jeffery Skilling told the Arthur Andersen 
conference
in Houston yesterday...

* Turning California into all public power advances:  California Gov Gray 
Davis
began circulating The Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights (RT, 
yesterday)
proposals yesterday calling for a state takeover of the industry...

Priggish and piggish in California 
Mark Steyn 
National Post 
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but 
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's 
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South 
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, 
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio 
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, 
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island 
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's 
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside 
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's 
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New 
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, 
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact 
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British 
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when 
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been 
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the 
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green, 
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in 
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were 
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the 
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return 
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was 
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and 
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its 
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for 
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.) 
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best 
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a 
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it 
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush 
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California 
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in 
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of 
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of 
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio 
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in 
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio 
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the 
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000 
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but 
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis 
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming 
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California. 
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And 
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By 
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that 
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're 
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at 
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power 
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber 
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO 
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's 
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence 
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make 
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr. 
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in 
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of 
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction: 
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living 
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery, 
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a 
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price 
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another 
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one 
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic 
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build 
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's 
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a 
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office. 
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching 
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to 
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price 
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy 
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those 
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service 
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public 
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable," 
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps, 
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members 
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean, 
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in 
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every 
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a 
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the 
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about 
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just 
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable 
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just 
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century 
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its 
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than 
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an 
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly 
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own, 
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous, 
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world 
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to 
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

Mr. Piazze,

I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times 
in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:


When in the evening will Greg give his speech?
Who long is he scheduled to speak?
Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises 
to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so.
What is the dress code?


Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

An outstanding year!

2000, of course. It was extraordinary, by any measure.

How many years can you name that start with a great hoax -- Y2K -- and end 
with a monumental hoot -- the world's greatest democracy can't get the hang 
of how to elect a President?

We're not the only mad conspiratorialist to divine that the Y2K scare was the 
brilliant handiwork of a cabal of top computer makers intent on sparking 
sales -- and what a wildly successful scheme it was.

Few, however, are privy to the knowledge that the massive snafu of election 
2000 was no improbable statistical fluke but the Machiavellian contrivance of 
Ross Perot exacting revenge for being denied his usual place on the ballot. 
Besides, it finally occurred to Ross that he wasn't going to be President, 
and that made him as mad as a plucked rooster: If he wasn't going to be 
President, by gum, nobody was going to be President!

Even though election 2000 demonstrated a small defect -- an inability to pick 
a winner (but remember, nothing's perfect) -- it did put to rest some nasty 
aspersions that have long been cast on the workings of this blessed republic. 
Most particularly, it buried once and for all the cynical notion that money 
can buy the Presidency. Both parties spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
trying to do just that -- and came up empty.

So let's not hear any more nonsense about the Presidency being for sale. It's 
now quite clear that the Presidency can't be bought; conceivably, though, it 
can be stolen.

What remains to be determined is which of the pretenders can pull off the 
theft. Mr. Bush would seem to enjoy a congenital advantage, since the 
governor of the state whose votes ultimately will prove decisive is his baby 
brother.

On the other hand, Al Gore has the overwhelming support and counsel of the 
trial lawyers. Trial lawyers, after all, make a profession of knowing how to 
get away with murder. So they should find figuring out how to snatch the 
Presidency mere child's play.

Not the least remarkable thing about this most remarkable year is that the 
Supreme Court seemingly has abandoned its long tradition of following the 
election returns in favor of helping to shape them. The good part is that 
there are nine of them-seven mostly old men and two women of a certain 
age-assuring a majority ruling, unless one recuses himself because he simply 
can't stand Florida.

Only in America in the year 2000.

-- As you're undoubtedly and possibly painfully aware, 2000 is already 
memorable in Wall Street as the year the air began to whoosh out of the 
monster stock-market bubble and, after many a frustrating try, the year the 
bears finally ate Goldilocks.

In fact, unless such portents as mounting claims for unemployment insurance 
and the latest downbeat readings on business from the purchasing managers are 
completely misleading, 2000 will go down as the beginning of the end of the 
most salutary and long-lived economic boom to grace this nation (and probably 
any other).

These are, admittedly, negative distinctions. But if you're a year and want 
to be famous, you can't be picky: No one harks back to 1929 because it was a 
great year for butterflies.

Nasdaq unarguably has turned in a once-in-a-lifetime performance this year. 
Never before has a stock-market index caused as much pain in so short a time 
as did Nasdaq in its breathtaking (and wealth-evaporating) 50% drop from its 
March high to its close last Thursday. What's more, it has a full month to 
better (worsen?) that fantastic feat.

Nor does the plunge in the index -- formidable as it is -- do full justice to 
the awesome decline. A much more graphic picture is painted by the slides in 
individual issues. Here, we're indebted to a sometime correspondent named 
Howard Boyet, who sent us a list of 90 of the most gruesome casualties. Alas, 
space -- and solicitude for those readers of an especially delicate 
disposition -- prevent us from listing the entire wretched roster. But a 
sampling will give you the flavor.

For instance, Foundry Networks, which peaked at 212, was last seen at around 
41. Harmonic has fallen from 158 to 7-plus. Internet Capital from 212 to 6. 
FreeMarkets, from 370 to 29.50 (not quite free yet, but it's getting there). 
VA Linux, from 320 to 8. Red Hat, 151 to 6. Inktomi, 241 to 24. DoubleClick, 
135 to 13. Akamai, 346 to 27. Next Level, 202 to 11 (we dread to contemplate 
the stock's next level). MicroStrategy, 333 to 12 (might be something wrong 
with the strategy). Ask Jeeves, 144 to 10 (if it's all the same, we'd rather 
not ask him). And on and drearily on.

So if you own stocks like Dell Computer (60 to 18) or Gateway (81 to 19) or 
Texas Instruments (100 to 37) or Oracle (46 to 26), you can take some comfort 
in the knowledge that you could have owned any of the above or the likes of 
Razorfish (57 to 3), Novell (44 to 6) or Covad (67 to 2).

These exercises are now commonplace, and journalistically, we suppose, 
they're the equivalent of a circus freak show. But they do, as Mr. Boyet 
suggests, provide a more vivid and even more accurate description of the 
damage wrought.

What we've found most intriguing is that, until now, all this blood in the 
Street has evoked very little public outcry. We've experienced a kind of 
cruel and vast but silent mugging. Magazines like Time and Newsweek haven't 
done their usual heavy-breathing treatments, nor have most newspapers, 
including the New York Times, made a front-page fuss about the decline and 
fall of Nasdaq. Nor are the networks running their usual inane specials.

Moreover, until quite recently, mutual-fund shareholders have placidly 
watched their wealth withering. No crowds gathering in front of fund 
headquarters and, more tellingly, no rush to redeem their holdings.

There are several possible explanations for this rather astonishing 
diffidence on the part of the financially wounded and the absence of hysteria 
in the press, both the electronic version and the genuine item. The 
distraction of the election that never ends. The fact that most everyone who 
wants one still has a job and a relatively high comfort level. Whatever the 
cause or combination of causes, that we're in a bear market, and a vicious 
one, doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.

Until it does and until fear stalks the Street and an ugly grizzly makes the 
cover of Time, if you run into anyone claiming to espy a bottom, take him 
firmly by the hand and guide him to the nearest ophthalmologist.

-- That chart adorning this page depicts another reason why there's lots of 
room still on the downside. (See accompanying illustration -- Barron's Dec. 
4, 2000) It comes to us courtesy of George Gilman, the savvy and talented 
producer of the Business Picture, a wonderful quarterly compilation of charts 
and info on the economy and the markets.

The last official number for the Nasdaq P/E, he reports, was 139.1 for 
October, but he reckons the figure fell to somewhere around 107 by the end of 
November.

As George comments: "Even after the 48.5% decline from the March 10 peak of 
5048.62 to Thursday's close of 2597.93, the P/E on Nasdaq is incredibly high."

And that's the point. The multiple wouldn't be cheap at half its current 
level. Nor would it shock us if, eventually, Nasdaq and its P/E fell another 
50%.

-- While we're convinced we're in the early stages of a secular bear market, 
we know there'll be blips in this descent just as there were dips in the late 
great bull market.

In truth, we're surprised we haven't had a halfway decent rebound yet. 
Certainly, we're overdue for one. Consider this a heads-up on what might 
trigger a bounce (apart from a miraculous resolution to the election snarl).

Next Tuesday, Alan Greenspan is slated to deliver the keynote address to a 
gathering of commmunity bankers in New York City (which is not overrun by 
community banks but is a great place to visit). We haven't a clue as to what 
he intends to say, and it might well be nothing intelligible.

But should Mr. G make a sly reference to the economy and monetary policy and 
hint that maybe the Fed is poised to shift from tight to neutralthat just 
could rouse spirits in Wall Street enough to ignite a fairly brisk -- if 
relatively brief -- move up.

-- John Liscio died last week. John was our colleague at Barron's for roughly 
a half-dozen years in the late 'Eighties and early 'Nineties, and not a day 
went by that he didn't light up the place.

He was vibrant and funny, outrageous and irreverent, extraordinarily 
intelligent. He was brash and tough and had an insatiable appetite for 
mischief. Yet he was also warmly affectionate, shirt-off-his-back generous 
and, oddly, possessed of a touching ingenuousness.

John had an expansive mind that ranged restlessly and relentlessly over just 
about every subject known to literate and inquiring man and a few that only 
his special imagination provided entry to. He was a baseball nut, a 
cantankerous pitcher for and captain of Barron's softball team and a demon 
participant in the Fantasy League, where grown men play at being 
owner-managers of major-league teams. In fact, he was the commissioner of his 
league (in which role, we can only surmise, he visited great anguish on his 
fellow Fantasy Leaguers).

As a writer, John was exceptional. He brought to economics and markets a 
knowledge not only of those murky subjects but also of the wide world; a 
gifted and fluent pen and a sense of humor that could be -- inevitably was -- 
deliciously wicked. He would leap with positive glee on some unfortunate with 
a tempting name. There was a chap named LaWare at the Fed, for example, whom 
John inevitably and with some purpose called UnaWare. Morgan Stanley 
economist Stephen Roach was rarely mentioned by John but as the proprietor of 
the Roach Motel, where the facts check in but don't check out.

He was a brilliant journalist, both at Barron's and at U.S. News, and, 
against all advice and odds, launched an economic newsletter, the Liscio 
Report, which became a roaring success. The reason was simply that John had 
more wit in one pinky and more insight in the other than any dozen economists.

John, who was spunk personified, showed unbelievable courage as he battled 
his last illness. When we visited him in his hospital room and told him 
joshingly he looked like hell, he grinned that indomitable grin of his and 
launched into a couple of hours of dissertation on the state of the world, 
excitedly detailing his plans for the future.

He was the most indomitable person we've ever met. All of us here at Barron's 
and, for that matter, anyone lucky enough to have known him, will miss him 
terribly.

Attached is a portfolio summary of the NEPCO Project Life VAR's by the 
category of risks. I have been trying to get the VARS  summed in this order 
since we initiated this activity, but we lost our analyst and it has been a 
bit of a struggle.  The table effectively identifies the Construction Risk as 
the major risk not the Guarantees. They are interrelated and I have provided 
a comment on the connectivity.  Brian will be in Houston on Wednesday.  There 
are several issues to discuss on NEPCO.  We should likely meet with you 
and/or Basil to discuss.



Comments and clarifications:  (Thousands 000 Omitted) (Project Life Portfolio 
Summary)

Revenue  VAR ( $12,351)
This VAR is simply the interest rate risk over time

Materials / Equipment VAR ($21,700)
Calculated price risk of Procurement of Materials and Equipment over life of 
Project.  Heavily influenced by the Balance of Plant and bulks as the 
Equipment Island is normally a transfer from the owner  with minimal risk to 
NEPCO

Construction VAR ($43,896) 
This VAR represents the execution risks in engineering, construction and 
start up.  It is influenced by three elements: Definition, Productivity, and 
Timing.  Money spend can be accelerated to avoid Liquidated Damages thus the 
link to guarantees.  The sensitivity of this VAR is primarily the 
availability of  data for engineering timing plus engineering and 
construction labor price and productivity.

Schedule / Performance VAR ($26,177)
This VAR is calculated on the Performance LD's, Schedule LD's, and Aggregate 
Guarantees plus the Warranty.  Due to the timing and segregation of these 
risks, the project life VAR is not so severe.  The risks of LD's especially 
schedule LD's can be often off set by increased spending. 

Total Project VAR ($75,913)
The attachment provides only the P95 VAR, representing near worse case.  We 
also calculate the P75 VAR which is $31,212.  The credit risks of the owner 
and the five major suppliers which is not shown on the attachment must also 
be considered. It is calculated at an additional $31,162.   


An informed buyer would likely calculate the risk in NEPCO to be in range of 
$50 to $100 million and would likely discount the profit stream by this 
amount or ask us to guarantee the contracts.  
 
NEPCO has a project reserve / contingency of $75 million and a profit backlog 
of $131 million plus a warranty reserve on the books.

UCU: Energy Merchant Drives Strong 3Q Earnings; Aquila Transaction By Year
End

* This morning, UtiliCorp reported recurring operating EPS of $0.50,
in-line with our estimate, and a 8.7% increase from $0.46 in the year ago
quarter.
* Results exclude a $44 million or $0.30 per share gain from the IPO
of Uecomm, the telecom arm of their Australian subsidiary United Energy.
* Aquila energy merchant segment remains growth driver; EBIT up 87%
yr./yr., and now contributes 42.1% of UtiliCorp's earnings.
* Aquila expects to begin transacting in the high-growth bandwidth
commodity market in Q4:00 or Q1:01; we see Aquila as one of the
first-movers, behind  Enron and Dynegy (both rated 1H) in this nascent
market.
* We reiterate our 1H (Buy, High Risk) rating and $36 price target for
UtiliCorp.   We feel that a strategic transaction involving Aquila (i.e.
IPO, joint venture)-- expected by the end of the year-- will enable
UtiliCorp to extract Aquila's value as a leading Energy Merchant.

Statement by Governor George W. Bush

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  Our nation
watched as we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of
each and every vote.  We were reminded of the strength of our democracy
- that while our system is not always perfect, it is fundamentally
strong and far better than any other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount and yet
another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled
to have won the state of Florida, which gives us the needed electoral
votes to win the election.  We will therefore undertake the
responsibility of preparing to serve as America's next President and
Vice President.

Statement by James A. Baker III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in this very
room that the election process in - Florida and in the country as a
whole - needed to conclude with fairness and finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about what was at
stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable end to the process of
counts, challenges and contests if it slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

Statement by Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job that you
and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the
election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty. But we
got the job done, and we got it done right. People called me and
say--particularly from out of state--and say what's going on down in
Florida, and I have to keep reminding people, the only thing that's
going on here is that we've got a razor-thin election for the most
important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the anguish,
we've just got a close election. And any state that had to go through
this would've had the same problems, I think, that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the important
word there, "should." You know, Yogi Berra once said, ``It's not over
till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a winner, and it's time
to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough
legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas. But one thing the
lawyers can't do for us and one thing the courts can't do for us: They
can't bring this country together again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight, it's
going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together
again, and I hope we can get on with that work soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

Reaction to Governor Bush's Statement

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
"The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and that Gore
requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's rules... [Gore has] to
consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at
this, and say, 'Guys you had your shot, the count, the recount - they
changed the rules for you and you still did not win.'  It's time to be
magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech: "...the tone...was perfect...

"There was a persistence and a determination in what [Governor Bush]
said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.  It was the first kind of
conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this, and that probably
goes to peoples hearts."

        - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court Says Expert
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

Fox News' Brit Hume: "...does the Gore team not have something to work
with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on
Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of continuing, a sort of
unfinality if such a word exists."

National Journal's Stuart Taylor: "...Unless I'm missing something that
is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing what so ever, I think-that
the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore.  They could
do some things for George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do
anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, "Oh by the way could you
order some more recounts?"  So I think there is nothing, if...Gore runs
out of ammunition.  Which I think he may well do, before the Supreme
Court of the United States gets to a hearing.  I think he has to give
up, because there's nothing..."

______________________________________________

Call To Action

Florida tonight certified the votes cast in the Presidential Election,
giving it's 25 electoral votes to George W. Bush.

George W. Bush won the vote on election day and won the mandated recount.
He won on November 17, after the inclusion of the overseas ballots.  Now he
has won after the manual recount as directed by the Florida Supreme Court,
and the results have been certified.

If you believe this election should end and that endless lawsuits are not
good for our country, please call your Congressman
and Senator, regardless of their party affiliation, and tell them that Al
Gore should concede!

Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed 
distribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe 
contract.

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an 
economic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not 
exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

Korea:

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's 
currency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since 
January.

Brazil:

Argentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in 
January. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.




Thoughts and comments welcome.

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to "soak up liquidity" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself," said 
Altra's Coleman. "But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another." 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply "providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace." 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "Big Brother" 
of the energy marketplace. 

"The historical information is not available," EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well." He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

The FIX module v1.0 is now operational and meets all the specifications as 
shown in the FRS.  The team would be happy to show you a demo at your 
convenience, perhaps early next week.  We anticipate our back office using 
FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX 
"under fire" for January 2001 invoices.

The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial 
counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare Enron data and 
Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a 
mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the 
1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the 
primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely 
manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort 
functions), Enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra 
invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.

Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We 
anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.


All the best,

Tom

	CheMatch.com continues auction growth
Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET 
	HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 
metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction 
system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the 
auction's inception last summer. 
	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions 
said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be 
tailored to the needs of each user. 
	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have 
traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is 
about $800,000. 
	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons 
of product has been transacted. 
	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and 
early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. 
	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the 
company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to 
bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end 
of the year. 
	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers 
and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its 
investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), 
Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and 
Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH).

o Online Marketing Firm iChoose Shuts Down

DALLAS -- iChoose, a developer of e-commerce marketing
systems, said it has shut down due to lack of funding.
In the past couple of months, the company has struggled
to stay alive by seeking out additional funding,
and even signed a letter of intent to be acquired.
That  acquisition fell through and the company said
it had no other choice than to close. iChoose was
unable to disclose the would-be-acquirer due to
legal restrictions. On its Web site, the company
posted a message with uninstall instructions for
its software and a final farewell to its customers.
iChoose was backed by Sevin Rosen.

 "Structured Derivatives" holds the spread options from the Eastern VPS 
deals.  We hedge with swaps to the power and gas books, leaving all our gamma 
and vega exposure.  The $43mm is a big gamma loss because of the moving power 
curve and a big vega loss because of the moving gas volatility curve.

I am looking to change the loss violation reporting so we report power and 
gas numbers including any movements in the spread option book.  Ted Murphy 
agrees.

Sounds like a possible approach although it looks like it reports into 3 
policy committee members instead of one. Does Rice have an issue with it 
reporting into us?

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Congratulations to you all on an exceptional effort in getting the Harrah's 
electricity deal closed! I know it was tough managing through the  internal 
issues- contract language, tariff/power pricing curve adjustments,etc- but it 
was the right thing to do and both the deal and Enron is much better off. 

Marty, Ken, Sean- Great job in keeping the customer at the table and still 
getting them to execution given all the changes in the last two weeks. 

Great job by all....congrats!

Subject: Enron Center North/Enron Center South Damage & Restoration Overview

Bill/Philippe-

Below is a summary of the major problems which occurred the past 96 hours and 
the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk.

Enron Center North (1400 Smith)

As a result of the flooding downtown, approximately six skyscrapers had their 
electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the 
electrical grid downtown. The net result was the loss of one of the two 35kv 
circuits which serve 1400 Smith. We (engineers, EES Maint, electrical subs)  
believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single 
phase power, which caused an imbalance in the load to the building. 

Consequently, UPS "C" which serves a portion of the Lv 34 Data Ctr, the Rolm 
phone switch, and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard, and 
blew two internal fuses. This power degradation caused PDU "S" on Lv 34 to 
trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on 
this PDU. This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday.

Response/Restoration

> UPS "D" transferred load from UPS "C" as the N+1 back up and carried the 
full load of the UPS loss as designed
> EPSC/electrical sub (Henderson Electric); EES Maint; IT worked together to 
power down systems to begin repair work by 4:00pm Saturday
> EPSC/EES Maint coordinated with Pillar/Henderson Elec to obtain replacement 
parts and begin the repairs. By 9:30pm all repairs to UPS"C" had been made 
and the system bought back on line. As a measure of extra protection the back 
up genset for Enron Ctr North  was in operation
> Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately 10:30pm Saturday 
evening
> EPSC/EES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and 
back up systems Saturday evening
> Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems 
Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in 
case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage

Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels, and water 
damage/flooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B-1

Enron Center South (1500 Louisiana)

Impact/Damage Summary

> Levels 8 & 9  received very limited amounts of water from the core area 
elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall. There was no exposure to water on 
any systems or network cabling during the entire period. (Response) Crews 
contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building.
> ALL IDF closets on Lvs 3-5 Traders Floors remained dry throughout the 
duration of the rains/flooding on Friday & Saturday
> Lv 6 received some water from Lv 7. (Response) The area was contained and 
cleaned. No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure, a 10" sanitary sewer 
line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv  
B-1 area (approximately 4-6 inches of water in the basement. (Response)  
Clark & Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the 
on going flood waters from penetrating the basement. Clean up has continued 
throughout the weekend   
> Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure, the water seal of the 
Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 
24-30" of water. This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 
1:30pm on Staurday afternoon. The back up systems engaged and operated per 
design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors. The temporary cooling 
tower went off line. Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of 
tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7-1-01 in prep for 
the migration (Response) 
 * Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant 
electrical vault, as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
 * The Data Ctr AHU's were kept on line with the dehumidifiers/blowers to 
modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr. EPSC had Way Engr techs use 
temp/humidity probes
    to monitor the areas. The recordings indicated temps on Lvs 8 & 9 did not 
exceed 78 degrees and relative humidity did not exceed 68% during the outage
 * Clark/Fisk Elec/EPSC coordinated desing efforts and obtained gear on an 
emergency basis and completed the tie in off the temporary coolong tower to 
the 
    generators by 10:30pm
 * Reliant Energy is still cleaning and replacing gear in th vault room. 
Presntly (AT 11:00PM Sunday) we have one circuit operational in the building 
and 50% of the
              Reliant  gear on line). We are still operating all systems 
safely on the back up sytems for the past 36 hours. It is expected Relaint 
will be complete by 7:00am.
   Clark; the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system 
review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during 
the coming
   week.

In summary, the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as 
designed; however, due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the 
systems the facility held up extremely well. I would also like to note 
throughout the ordeal beginning Friday evening through Sunday, everyone 
(Enron NetWorks;EES FacilitiesClark Const;Way Engring;Fisk Electric;Henderson 
Electric; KW-Pillar;Hines) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure 
and the most severe conditions I have seen in downtown Houston. 
Communication, around the clock work  and cool heads managed to assess damage 
and develop action/restoration plans to facilitate repairs for Monday business

Let me know if you need further details on specific issues or items.

regards-

Henry

Subject:  Solution to the Enron's dabhol Power Plant Situation


Hi Jeff

I have the following thoughts for a clean solution to the Dabhol Power
Plant situation

Background

Locals:

Local govt in the State of Maharashtra wants to squeeze them by  forcing
them to keep the plant operating but refusing to pay  [ standard Chinese
torture in the 3rd world when the real pain starts after you part with the
money and stuck in the tar pit]

The Central govt characters were previously involved with the "fast track"
approval ,  are now hesitant to help out for the fear of political damage .

The elctricity is now too expensive for the locals due to $/Rupee and Oil
Price hit per the original contract that locals signed and did not hedge!

This has become an unpopular political football with prior champions
running for cover, so only bad things will come out of it if the agony
prolongs

Enron:

Enron has made a paradygm shift from physical to intellectual assets, so
the  India Powe Plant  does not fit the forward path

This is an example of "how not to do things" as it was done with highest
profile and  with open involvement of political Mafia, involving  broad
allegations of corruption and highly unusual approval and guarantee
process. Enron does not need this "Tar Baby" any more

If they get rid of this problem, the stock is likely to go up 10 % , a
better arbitrage for getting rid of this liability


AIG:

Ambassador Wisner, Vice Chairman of AIG was the US Ambassador to India
during this period and knows all the cast of characters  and the situation
well. He is also the President of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and
is trying to reconcile the situation. Since he is wearing 2 hats, he does
not want to approach Enron for a role in getting rid of this liability. I
have discussed this issue with him at length

I am the only person who knows ALL the cast of characters involved in this
drama very well. I have met Ken as we were keynote speakers at a conference
and later met in NY for personal chat. Jeff  gave me a personal tour of the
trading floor when he was the head of trading at Enron and I was head of
trading at Citibank.. Sanjay Bhatnagar, their previous  India man whio
worked closely with Rebecca is also known to me .
 Additionally, I personally know the current Chief Minister of the State of
maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, all the Left Front partners, Mr Pawar who
initially approved the deal as the previous Chief Minister. I also know  Mr
Munde and Mr Thakare, the two politicians who approved the expansion of
this project when they were in power. Current minister in charge of the
Power Portfolio is also a friend of mine. My contacts with all of these
people were developed over the past 10-20 years and  are on a close
personal basis; hence, I have a neutral, trusted position with all
concerned

I have close contact with Reliance  and  Tatas and personally  discussed
this situaton with the owners during my trip to Bombay last week. As you
know, nothing gets done there without Reliance's blessings

Solution;

If Enron empoweres me, I  can negotiate a clean break in this situation
that will be mutually beneficial and free up the management's energies to
focus on the main business. Ambassador Wisner is  fully supportive of this,
as he just does not want to take personal  initiative for the reasons of
apparent confliict of interest .

I can broker political and business peace with a clean sale of assets to
the locals or their nominees at a fair market value. Enron , being a
"merchant-operator', understands the concept of "mark-to-market" valuation
better than anyone else

This is more of a negotiated solution, brokered by a skillful negotiator
with "East-West" skills and connections rather than an M&A transaction

The lenders' interests are not aligned with those of Enron and a separate
peace needs to be brokered  with the locals, if they so desire

Dealing with the burocrats with politicians playing " puppeteers" in the
background will cause further "quicksand" effect

Time is of the essence as this is akin to the "perishable goods" problem

I wud like to get together with the key  decision makers on the Enron side
to present this view

You know my professional background and qualification and I feel very
confident that I am the only person in the unique position to extricate all
concerned with  the ability to forge a fair solution

I do NOT want to announce this when it happens.  We have been quietly 
avoiding how much activity we have done so far and many people assume that we 
already have done many...an assumption that helps us.  So please do NOT issue

RedMeteor.com takes exchange to former Soviet Union

HOUSTON, Nov. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- RedMeteor.com, an Internet-based 
commodities exchange, today announced it was selected to provide a modified 
energy exchange platform to Energy Trade System, a venture uniting a group of 
key energy players in the former Soviet Union. 

The platform will allow Energy Trade to launch trading platforms for refined 
products exported through the Baltic Sea ports. 

Energy Trade System's founding partners are Sibneft, the Russian Ministry of 
Railways, pipeline operator Transneft, product pipeline operator 
Transnefteproduct and fiber optic cable operator TransTeleCom Company. 

This agreement promotes the Houston-based RedMeteor's trading platform and 
extends its technical capacity in enabling energy and non-energy commodity 
trading platforms globally. 

"We are very pleased to provide platform licensing and hosting services to 
ETS," Vincent DiCosimo said in a news release. "RedMeteor's platform 
configuration is designed to be highly scalable and capable of adapting to 
any commodity type quickly. This transaction confirms our expectations in 
that regard." 

Sibneft President Eugene Shvidler said the "agreement with RedMeteor will 
help ETS meet its goal of providing round-the-clock reliability, ease of use, 
superior response time and the best transaction security available." 

"Through the creation of new Internet-based platforms, ETS aims to 
revolutionize the way that energy is bought and sold, both in FSU export 
markets and on the Russian domestic market," Shvidler said in a news release. 

Sibneft is a Russian oil company with operations spanning exploration, 
production, refining and marketing of petroleum products. Sibneft produces 
some 330,000 barrels per day from fields in Western Siberia. The company also 
is affiliated with the 385,000 barrel per day Omsk refinery. 

RedMeteor.com is a global, Internet-based, exchange marketplace for crude 
oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and electricity.

Itochu,APX To Start Online Pwr Bourse In Japan Spring '01
11/16/2000 

SEOUL -(Dow Jones)- Itochu Corp. (J.CIT) of Japan and Automated Power 
Exchange (X.AUP) of the U.S. will jointly launch their Web-based exchange for 
retail electricity trade in Japan in the spring of next year, Shinichi 
Aburaya, project manager for Itochu's power projects group told Dow Jones 
Newswires Thursday. 

The online exchange was originally scheduled to start in November this year.

Frank Lim, director of marketing in Asia for APX, said the delay wasn't due 
to technical problems. 

"We are clearing commercial and technical regulatory milestones one by one," 
Aburaya said, on the sidelines of the Energy North Asia 2000 conference in 
Seoul. 

Aburaya said the Web-based exchange is expected to start limited services in 
the first quarter of 2001. It will offer the full range of planned services 
later next year, he added. 

Using a patent-pending online trading system, the exchange will match sellers 
holding excess electricity with potential buyers. A seller will input 
information required for the sale - the electricity volume, an offer price, 
and the timing of the delivery of the power supply. 

Buyers can seek desirable terms and conditions on the Web site. 

Itochu and APX aim to lure market participants ranging from power and gas 
utilities to trading houses, department stores and banks. 

The move to create an online power exchange is part of the two companies' 
efforts to take advantage of the new freedom in Japan's electricity industry, 
after deregulation last spring ended a 50-year monopoly for regional power 
utilities. 

Under reforms implemented March 21, newcomers are allowed to sell retail 
electricity directly to high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial 
users, which together account for roughly 28% of Japan's total power demand. 

During his address at the Energy North Asia 2000 conference, Aburaya said 
Itochu and APX plan to provide the following services on their online 
electricity exchange: industry and deregulation news; consulting services on 
effective use of surplus power capacity, procurement guidance, and grid 
connection assistance. 

He said the online exchange will eventually evolve to offer shorter-term 
contracts. 

"Over time, we hope to meet market needs in the gradual progress of 
deregulation..." Aburaya said. "Now, only yearlong contracts are practical, 
but we plan to offer quarterly, monthly, weekly, day-ahead and one-hour 
blocks." 

Itochu and APX also plan to offer services to deal with credit management, 
payment, and billing issues, he said. 

"These planned services will come a little bit later," Aburaya said. 

Itochu and APX are inviting utility companies and others to invest in their 
venture, tentatively called JPX. Itochu plans to hold a 20% to 25% stake in 
JPX. 

Aburaya said his company continues seeking investors in the project.

Given the current economic climate, BusinessWeek will gather leading economic 
editors and advisors to give a special briefing at our upcoming Breakthrough 
executive event, taking place June 27-29, 2001 at the Rancho Bernardo Inn, 
San Diego, California.

For more information about Breakthrough go to 
http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a14110a34607a63653009a1.

Entitled "The New Economy Downturn," this briefing will feature a keynote 
address from BusinessWeek Economics Editor and author of the best-seller, 
"The Coming Internet Depression," Michael Mandel. Mandel will also lead an 
exclusive, closed-door roundtable discussion among BusinessWeek's top editors:

-  BusinessWeek Washington Editor Lee Walczak will tell us why Washington 
hasn't panicked over the downturn and offer a prediction of future action by 
the Fed, the Hill, and the White House

-  Senior L.A. Correspondent Chris Palmeri will assess the impact on the 
California economy and its energy crisis in the context of the downturn.

-  BusinessWeek Online's "Street Wise" columnist Margaret Popper will share 
her insights on how the Street may respond in these uncertain times.

Together, these editors (and others to be confirmed) will offer Breakthrough 
delegates access to the best economic intelligence available and facilitate a 
candid dialogue on the most pressing issues on every chief executive's mind.

***** Qualified BusinessWeek subscribers are entitled to a preferred 
participation fee ($2500, standard fee is $3250) at Breakthrough, which will 
convene a small group of senior executives (vice presidents and above) to 
discuss breakthrough ideas in business leadership. To participate, please 
complete the registration application at 
http://www.you-click.net/GoNow/a14110a34607a63653009a0.
Please use the code BT-BWS to indicate your subscriber status.*****

The economic briefing is only one of the diverse topics being examined at the 
conference. BusinessWeek's goal in convening Breakthrough is to create a 
setting where there can be meaningful discussion on the fundamental changes 
that are occurring in the business environment. Through intense interaction 
among delegates, we hope to facilitate a meaningful discourse on the trends, 
theories and technologies that underlie today's key corporate issues.

Facilitated by an elite faculty of thought leaders, the discourse will be 
structured around these five issues:

-  The Changing Rules of Leadership and The Evolving Qualities of Leaders
-  Continuous Supply-Chain Funding and Precision Demand Forecasting
-  Globalization, Technology, and the "Trusted Identity"
-  Pervasive Computing and the Proliferation of Wireless Technologies
-  Customer Ascendancy

The retreat's co-founder and provocateur, Jim Taylor, has been named one of 
America's leading business futurists by the Wall Street Journal. The former 
head of global marketing for Gateway, he has served as a consultant and 
strategist to firms at the forefront of the New Economy, and has written and 
spoken extensively on the sweeping changes technology has wrought on our 
corporate, political, and cultural systems. His books, The 500 Year Delta and 
The Visionary's Handbook, co-written with Watts Wacker, are widely regarded 
as indispensable reads for forward-thinking executives.

Joining Jim, the retreat's esteemed faculty will include:

-  Deepak Chopra, M.D., Founder, The Chopra Center for Well Being
-  Dr. Ronald Heifetz, Co-director, The Center for Public Leadership, John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University
-  Sandy Kemper, Founder and CEO, eScout
-  Suzanne D. Lyons, Chief Marketing Officer, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
-  Michel Mayer, General Manager, Pervasive Computing Group, IBM Corporation
-  Jonathan Nelson, Co-founder, CEO, and Chairman, the Organic Institute
-  Will Rodgers, Principal, SHR Perceptual Management
-  Geoffrey S. L.  Shaw, President, CEO, Chairman and Co-founder, Global 
Commerce Systems
-  Guy S. Tallent, President and CEO of Identrus
-  J. Craig Venter, Ph.D.. President and Chief Scientific Officer, Celera 
Genomics Corporation
-  Stephen G. Vetter, President, Eureka Communities

In a unique teamwork exercise, four-time America's Cup Champion Dennis Conner 
and members of his "Stars and Stripes" crew will lead Breakthrough delegates 
on a sailing regatta in San Diego Harbor. Ten boats manned by Breakthrough 
executives will engage in an Olympic style sailboat race in the San Diego 
Harbor. The boats will serve as tools in this exercise designed to explore 
the new realities of leadership, competition, and teamwork in the new 
economy. The race is serious but the lesson (and the fun) will be invaluable.

Interested parties are encouraged to apply asap as capacity is limited to 100 
executives and few spaces remain. For complete details on Breakthrough's 
agenda and speakers, please visit

Weekly Update (11/10/00)

College football season is winding down, which means a busy month for
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly and the Texans'
scouting staff.

Casserly visited Texas A&M and the University of Miami this week before
returning to Houston Friday for facility and scouting meetings. He plans to
attend tomorrow's game between top-ranked Oklahoma and the 24th-ranked
Aggies in College Station. Next week, Casserly will continue his Big 12 tour
with a venture to Nebraska.

Leonard Shapiro of The Washington Post featured Casserly and the Texans in
his weekly NFL notes. Click here to read the story:
http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/A31203-2000Nov7
.html

Casserly will join Texans Owner Bob McNair in Austin Monday for a reception
at the home of Austin resident Lowell Lebermann.

"We're looking to extend our fan base all over southeast Texas and Austin is
a vital part of our push," Casserly says. "Football is a very important part
of the Austin community. We can offer their fans the best stadium in this
country, a new beginning and a team that they can grow with."

McNair is coming off a successful weekend at the Breeders' Cup in
Louisville. His filly Tout Charmant took second in the Filly & Mare Race
last Saturday. Tout Charmant can now boast six wins and nine second-place
finishes in 21 career starts. Next year's Breeders' Cup Championships will
be at Belmont Park.


More than 400 women attended the Houston Texans' first Football 101 Workshop
for Women this past Saturday at Foley's in downtown Houston.

The event was hosted by KTRK/ABC-13's Debra Duncan and KIKK 95.7 FM's Lisa
Dent. In a workshop setting, the group learned about life in the NFL, the
history of football, strategy, equipment and officials' signals. Texans
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly was the featured
speaker, joined by Hall of Fame safety Ken Houston, former Oilers wide
receiver Haywood Jeffires, Texans Director of Pro Scouting Chuck Banker,
Associate Director of Pro Scouting Bobby Grier, Associate Director of Pro
Scouting Miller McCalmon and former NFL referee Red Cashion.

KTRK taped the event and will air a half-hour Debra Duncan Show devoted to
Football 101 Saturday, Dec. 23, at 6:30 p.m.

On Thursday, May 31, Jeff Skilling is hosting a farewell dinner for Cliff 
Baxter at Brennan's.  You and your spouse/guest are invited.  Given the short 
timeframe under which we are working, I wanted to get it on your calendar 
sooner rather than later.  Formal invitations will be sent to your home 
within the next week.  SRS

George,

My Assistant, Liz Taylor, is the United Way Coordinator for Enron Net Works.  
Your group is listed with Net Works' United Way campaign.  Our participation

visit campaign.

Liz has listed below the employees, she believes, belong to your 
organization.  These are the names of those employees who have not gone 
online to make their pledge.  Please have your Assistant verify this list.  
If they are indeed your employees, I'm asking you to personally call them and 
ask them to go online and make their pledge.  If any of the names listed 
below are not with your group, please have your assistant notify Liz.

Should they experience difficulties getting online, please call Liz @ 
31935.   UnitedWay.Enron.com.

Thank you,

Greg Whalley

______________________________________________

Greetings Friends,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with 
Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court, and Governor 
Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that state's 25 electoral votes.  It is 
now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of incorporation for the 
Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As 
past transition foundations have done, we are applying for 501(c)(4) status 
from the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as our 
team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short 
period between now and inauguration day, January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in 1988, 
specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it also makes 
provisions for raising contributions from private sources to help defray 
transition-related expenses.  This has been done previously, most recently in 
1992.  We are now soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  
Would you please visit our new transition website at 
www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our secure server.

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from individuals.  No 
corporate or political action committee contributions will be accepted.  
Contributions may not exceed $5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all 
contributors, in compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure 
of financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website on a 
real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against an individual's 
annual political contribution federal giving limit of $25,000.

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to establish a 
government that will unify our country and make the common principles we 
share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's finance 
office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries should be directed to 
our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900. Your support of the Bush/Cheney 
Presidential Transition Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,


Donald L. Evans

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia

"One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely 
whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a 
reasonable interpretation of Florida law, 'legally cast vote[s].'  The 
counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten 
irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon 
what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.  Count first, and rule 
upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that 
have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."

"Another issue in this case, moreover, is the propriety, indeed the 
constitutionality, of letting the standard for determination of voters' 
intent- dimpled chad, hanging chads, etc.- vary from county to county, as the 
Florida Supreme court opinion, as interpreted by the Circuit Court, permits.  
If petitioner [Bush] is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful, 
permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an 
accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later, since it is 
generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the 
ballots, which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate."

Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T. Wells


DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand scrutiny which 
will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."
Excerpt:
"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not 
question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the 
majority. However, I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to 
reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process. I also believe 
that the majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will 
certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no foundation 
in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at anytime until 
the issuance of this opinion. The majority returns the case to the circuit 
court for this partial recount of  under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at 
best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others, the 
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally unknown. 
That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority 
creates."

"This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over 
continued judicial process. I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos, a 
professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, "[t]he 
margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, 
no matter who wins." Further judicial process will not change this 
self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder. Justice 
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action 
sixty-four years ago. I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls."

In planning one of the many fun activities for our upcoming holiday party, we 
thought a tarot card reader would be something that would be entertaining.
However, it has recently been brought to our attention that having a tarot 
reader would be offensive to some.  For those people, we would like to say 
that in the
planning of the holiday party there was never any intention of having a 
distasteful activity, but rather we were trying to be diverse in appealing to 
all the different
personalities of Net Works.

After a discussion and careful consideration, we have decided to cancel the 
tarot card reader.  We truly wish for everyone who attends to enjoy Net 
Work's first holiday party.

See you at the party!

Executive Summary
? Edison's MOU Condemned at this Friday's CPUC Meeting
? The Idle Plan Z 
? Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns 
? House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief

Edison's MOU Doubtful
The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal 
Edison's potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly 
optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders.  We have 
reported that through all plans from B-Z, there is not a solid plan to save 
this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions 
may come to fruition.

Over the last few days, Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the 
CPUC meeting this Friday as a make-or-break event for the company.  The is 
because after the meeting, Davis's MOU plan to buy SoCal's grid will have no 
chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy.  This plan is essentially dead 
although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases.  The final 
nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voting on 
several necessary MOU provisions.  Unless the CPUC makes a last minute, 
emergency - amendment to their agenda,  the deal will be dead (despite 
SoCal's support for letting the deal stand past its deadline).  Sources 
indicate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and 
continues to distance herself from Davis.  

Attempting to influence policy making, Edison executives have spent the last 
few investor phone conferences warning that June 8 would see substantially 
increased risks for a creditor-induced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies at 
CPUC.  This is interesting, since no one else seems to have been focused on 
the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week.  However, there is 
no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two 
weeks.   As reported several times earlier, most everyone had given up on the 
MOU long before this Friday's CPUC meeting.

Plan Z Shows Little Progress
Meanwhile, the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday, 
has gained little progress.  Legislators continue to pin-point a plan that 
will secure re-election votes and at the same time, weigh the need for rate 
hikes for California's corporate and home electricity users.  As they hash it 
out, the state is spending even more on electricity purchases.  In spite of 
better than expected levels of conservation, the state's electricity 
expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $79M/day. The recent 
rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question 
the reassuring Angelides scenario for California's budget prospects later 
this year.

The California Budget Crunch
Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last 
month's conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little 
misleading. During that conference call Angelides claimed that State 
Comptroller Connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers 
wrong.  Angelides argued that $7.2B already spent to buy power since January 
was really the total amount of authorized spending through late August.  In 
fact, he said only $4.3B of that had been "spent."  Sources now indicate that 
 Angelides was technically correct if you use "spent" to mean only the amount 
of money for which checks had been written.  This is different than the 
amount of money California had already promised to energy suppliers who had 
already supplied energy to the state.  In fact, when Angelides was speaking 
the state had in fact already promised to pay $7B for energy it had already 
consumed (the total committed has topped $8B.)  By the time the state gets 
its "power bonds" auctioned in August, they will have already spent all $12B 
and be back to dipping into the General Fund.   The idea of RANs being 
auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general 
fund doesn't make it to August. 

The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the 
painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of 
huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance.  Then the hope is 
that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings 
wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid.   The only near term path 
to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3,500 MW from QF 
plants which are off line because of cash flow problems.  Settling their 
needs is wrapped up in settling the PG&E and Edison trade creditor issues, 
which makes the legislature's leisurely approach to the rate hike/haircut 
situation all the more troublesome.

Energy Relief
The House Energy & Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1647 (the 
Emergency Electricity Relief Act) tomorrow at 10:00 am.  The bill which was 
twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps, but during 
the course of the mark-up, sources indicate that it is possible, even likely, 
that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment.  Rep. Waxman (D-CA) 
offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark-up of the bill at the 
subcommittee level.  The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines (all 
Republicans and 2 Democrats voted nay).  Sources inside Joe Barton's office 
report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on 
the price cap issue, but nothing has been resolved. As of this afternoon, 
those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the 
Committee tomorrow.  Since an agreement was not reached, compromise language 
is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow.  If it is, it would 
not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides have 
crafted together and therefore would not likely pass.  Sources indicate that 
the committee does expect Waxman, and possibly others to offer price cap 
language, but it is not expected to pass.

Restructuring Today readers got this story today...

Retail market
can be opened
nationally?
---
Joe Barton thinks
it can and is
about to try
---
Once in 20 years
opportunity seen

How can the retail power market be opened in today's atmosphere?
     Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work.
     He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual
meeting in Washington.   Barton implored the membership that if they
have any ideas on how to improve energy policy, this is the time to tell
policy makers or him.
     Barton sees a narrow, six-week opportunity as America is about to
revise its energy policy.
     We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he
means by a major energy restructuring bill.
     He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and
foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of
power from one place to another.
     He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it "in an
open access way -- creating all these trading markets where you have
long-term and short-term markets where you balance supply and demand
around the country.
     "States that have surplus power, through the RTO system can wheel
that power to states that need it."
     That's the wholesale market, we asked.
     Yes.
     But what about retail?
     He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of
buyers.
     How would that work?
     "AARP," Barton said noticing our age, "could sell you power or Wal-
Mart or McDonalds or the co-ops.  You could buy your power through
them."
     How would a law provide for aggregation?
     "It would be in the federal legislation that it would be
permitted," he replied.
     But what about Nebraska where there are only munis?
     "You've got to work through that and see if you get some kind of
grandfather or state opt-out provision.  It's possible that you give
states the right to opt out.  But over time those states will want to
opt in," he added.
     "That'll be a debate we'll have when we get into the bill.  You're
not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process," he
reminded with a smile.
     Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation
gestating in the nation's capital.
     "Everything" is up for discussion, he said, "everything.
     "There is nothing -- nothing -- that's been debated or talked about
in terms of electricity that is not on the table," Barton assured.
     "I'm not saying we're going to do it all but you have a window like
this once every 20 to 30 years.  I'm going to be damned if I'm going to
stand around and on my on volition take things off the table.
     "Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial
items out of play.  There'll be a region or a political block -- who
knows the president might not like something.  John Dingell might not
like something.  Who knows?  But I'm not -- even before we put pen to
paper to start drafting the bill -- say `we're not going to consider
this'," Barton added.
     Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative?
     "Yeah.  Very cooperative.  Of course, again, the proof is in the
pudding and in the details."
     Barton's in the leadership role in fostering a national energy
policy, taking the package from the vice president and guiding it
through the House.
     He's the president's energy guy from an energy state and Bush has
shown -- with the tax bill -- that he can get a program enacted.
     Barton wants something he can look back at in five, 10 and 20 years
and say "that's a good bill.  It works."
     Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of 2001.
     Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be "national, long-term
in its impact and balanced."
     Balanced means looking at the generation component, transmission
and distribution "and in each of those areas -- this is just me.  I'm
not speaking for anyone but myself" -- he wants "to create an
environment so we have a maximum, competitive situation that's open and
fair to everybody.
     "And we're going to do that and you're going to have a lot of
competition, a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and
a lot of choice for yourself," Barton added.
     Wait a minute.
     He's saying competition in transmission and distribution.
     We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the
time is right.
     We can't help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity
in a secondary market.
     You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local
distribution system in gas.  We're thinking aloud here.  That's not what
Barton said.
     He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually
have to.
     That puts Barton "a little at variance with some in the Bush
Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age
there's a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the
political arena means let Washington do it."
     Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into
the bill a distributed generation component.
     He's interested in negawatts, fostering cut backs in demand on a
national scale.
     "Looking out for your own interest," Barton considers to be
"democracy."
     But from time to time you have to step back and look at the
national interest, he advocated.
     "That's my job."
     Today's crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly.
     The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House
encouraged by the president's pride about the retail bill he got through
the Texas Legislature plus today's environment may be ideal for market-
minded leaders.

Greg,
See note below for detail but here is the exec summary.

We had a couple of big shifts on the curves yesterday which I want you to be 
aware of.  We wanted to put several major adjustments through on the same 
day.  The main moves are as follows:

Increased gas volatility - we moved the curve up significantly for the first 
several years. Lose o16mm
Power Peaks down, off-peaks up across the whole curve.    Gain o10mm

Because "structured Derivatives" is a separate line item, this book loses 
$43mm today, with power making approx $40mm to off-set.  The $43mm may need 
to be reported to Skilling, even though the real loss is just the gas loss of 
o16mm.

(There were several other clear up items put through, but the above 
represents the main issues to be aware of.  Net on the day we are up, and 
still expect to hit Q4 targets.).

Regards

Richard

Subject: UK Power Actual P&L results

We have now substantially calculated and confirmed the various line 
adjustments we have been working on with commercial over the past few weeks. 
The attached spread sheet shows the actual numbers (one number still to 
determine finally) against forecast. The main changes were as a result of the 
curves we used being a few days out of date and the front end of the live 
curve having moved from the scenario curves. Dates are included for when the 
P&L has been posted to the DPR. In addition to these numbers we booked a 
profit of around o8.8m on the 30th of November relating to the Climate Change 
Levy impact in the UK Power Energy Trends curve.

If you have any queries please let me know.

James

Subject: RE: EnronOnline Real-Time Quotes Service on Reuters

John,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power 
products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, 
Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to 
EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination 
rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide 
levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy 
desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would 
be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of 
branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. 
In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through 
Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

The EES VaR for today is $16.9 million, up from $15.6 million, due primarily 
to additional short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The short 
positions associated with the Univerisity of California facilities are 
expected to be removed early this week, which should decrease VaR.

How do you want me to handle pmt back to Greg for your return leg on Travel

The EES VaR for today is $5.0 million, down from $7.0 million on Friday.  VaR 
decreased primarily due to the May-01 long positions of 100,000 MWH added at 
NP and SP and the increase in the net short position in the Power East 
portfolio from (2.2) million MWH to (5.2) million MWH.

Summary:

* Toyota Managing Director Hiroyuki Watanabe commented that broad
cooperation was needed on fuel cell technology development as it pertains to
vehicles in order to commercialize the technology for this application.
While Toyota continues to develop hybrid vehicles, Watanabe believes fuel
cell vehicle technology has high hurdles to overcome.  In February the
automaker unveiled a prototype fuel cell vehicle, the FCHV-3, which also
includes a secondary nickel-metal hydride battery.

Subject: Alberta Gov't News Release on Inquiry into Energy Pricing

Tom Burns from GPC called to advise that his contacts with the Alberta Gov't 
told him that Premier Klein and Justice Minister Hancock intended to put out 
a news release between 1:15pm and 1:30 pm today indicating the Gov't has 
decided to call a hearing/inquiry on energy pricing in Alberta.  Tom does 
not  know what the form of this hearing/inquiry will be (i.e. an AEUB hearing 
or an independent inquiry (judicial or otherwise)) or whether it will involve 
natural gas and power or just power.   Tom's sense was that the mandate of 
the hearing/inquiry would be focused on providing policy makers with a clear 
understanding of the factors that are producing high energy price levels in 
Alberta and whether there are any policy steps that could/should be taken to 
address the current price levels.  He did not think the tone of the news 
release would be that the Government of Alberta needs to put a stop to the 
energy price gouging of consumers in Alberta.

A few minutes ago Tom Burns called me back to advise that Klein has now 
decided to delay the release of the new release until at least tomorrow as 
the Tory caucus has a half-day meeting tomorrow morning and the Premier wants 
to discuss how the Gov't should approach this issue with members of his 
caucus before he proceeds with the idea of a hearing/inquiry.

I have heard nothing from industry players so far about the DJ story except 
the Chairman of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta circulated 
the DJ story by email to the members of the IPPSA Board today with the 
following comment:   "It is too bad that the government has resorted to this 
tactic.  I guess they have a lot of pressure on them."

Regards,

Rob

? Hertzberg and Keeley announced that they are filing a petition with FERC to 
rehear the April 26th decision regarding price caps.  After going to D.C. and 
meeting with several FERC members, they decided to file for a rehearing.  
Their filing asks that the order should be in affect around the clock instead 
of just during Stage 1, that the actual costs be tied closer to the pricing 
of the product, and anyone that exceeding the cost-based pricing system have 
a 100% penalty.

? Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions 
included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, 
Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the 
Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, 
legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that 
he was getting to the point where CA "may just say no to prices that are too 
high" (via buyer cartel).

Subject: Draft of Organizational Announcement

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These 
investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private 
equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments 
unit.

This new group will report to an investment committee consisting of Greg 
Whalley, Ken Rice, and Dave Delainey.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in

What ?
We had $89m of value-at-risk concentrated primarily in Nymex short positions 
through July, August and September 01and we were $30m over our VaR limit for 
this commodity as at last night's close.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say this looks way out of bounds.
Has this been sanctioned ?

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20
Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20
affected will be notified shortly.
=20
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=
e=20
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20
shareholder value.

Dear Greg,

I just spoke with Liz regarding my request for a brief meeting with you this 
week.  In light of Enron's overall thrust to focus on merchant oriented 
activities and to diminish exposure on assets in emerging market, my boss, 
Chris Hunt, suggested that I meet with you, among other individuals, to seek 
advice on alternative career options at Enron.  Although I am open to areas 
in which I would be most useful to the company, I do have a particular 
interest in getting involved in wholesale electricity markets.

I hope you will have the time to meet briefly.  For your convenience, 
attached below is my resume.

Best regards,
Manuel

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is 
presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  
Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

I would suggest that we start reporting Capital Deployed and Funds Flow 
numbers in these reports as well
as the Wholesale Group will need to take the lead in managing both.

Hi Greg:
?
I have been fascinated by Enron's move into bandwidth for some  time now.? I 
firmly believe no company is in a better position to  understand the dynamics 
of the market or the importance of providing liquidity,  market-makers and 
transparancy to a market.
?
I am the CEO of a company called Bid4me.com, inc.? We are  an?start up with 
an eye for innovation in the internet solutions  field.? In particular, we 
are looking to bundle huge groups of small and  medium sized businesses 
into?blocks and force vendors to?bid  aggressively for their businesses in 
a?unique two-stage reverse auction  process.
?
We are?currently in stealth mode, however, our business  model so impressed 
Pillsbury Maddison Sutro, LLC (please see http://www.pillsburylaw.com ) that 
they  accepted us as clients on a deferred fee basis.
?
Our vision is to work with Enron to bring greater savings to  SMEs.??We will 
bring hundreds of SMEs' internet access demands at once  to several vendors.? 
Very few of them will be able to accommadate such  demand without appealing 
to companies like Enron for the provision of extra  bandwidth.? We would like 
to not only bring the SMEs to the vendors to bid  on but?to offer the vendors 
a bandwidth discount through exclusively using  Enron's market-place.
?
This way everyone benefits, including Enron.? Enron get's  a huge block 
demand for bandwidth and?its market-makers get the  revenue.??Enron will also 
gain greater credibilty through getting  increased liquidity flow.
?
The vendors, e.g. Adelphia Business Systems, benefit by  receiving a block 
discount through Enron and by receiving revenue from a large  block of SMEs.
?
The SMEs benefit by receiving savings passed on to them from  the Enron 
discount and through using the soon to be patented Bid4me  model.
?

Our website is currently housed on a Stanford University  Server.? ? However, 
very shortly it will be housed on our own  server.? So in the future you will 
be able to reach us at http://www.Bid4me.com
?
The site is password restricted so please be advised that  the:
?
login is:angels
password is: engelsev1
?
Note also the login/password is case sensitive
?
http://www.stanford.edu/~zpogue/bid4me/
?
If you double-click on the section 'For angel's eyes only' you will find  our 
current business plan and financials.? Our financials were written by  two 
CPAs in London.
?
You might be interested to know that aside from just  developing our alpha 
website we currently have a small team from Stanford  University ( including 
three PhDs) working on developing our alpha  prototype.
?
Brio, Inc have recently agreed to furnish us, for a trial  period, with their 
software licences (Brio explorer and Brio designer).?  The licence fees are 
usually $5,000.
?
Edgar.com have permitted us to have a free trail of their software.
?
We are looking for at least $1.5mm to launch Bid4me.? If  you have any 
interest in funding us or in working with us in the future I would  be very 
interested to hear your feedback. 
?
Last thing: as we are still in the process of applying for a  patent I would 
appreciate your discretion.? Please do not forward this  password-restricted 
website to anyone outside of Enron Corp.
?
Kind regards 
?
Sebastian Elliot
?

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This 
mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each 
activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to 
David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group 
mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a 
functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed 
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All 
functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the 
acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1 to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in 
previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  
as indicated on the attachment.

3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we 
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of 
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my 
current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO 
position.

transfer the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to close 
at 68 47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas lower today. 
I will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished. Also, will today's 
announcement about ENE effect you? Ben

MENLO PARK, Calif. -- U.S. Venture Partners (USVP),
a venture capital fund, said it expects to close
a $1 billion fund soon. USVP, founded in 1981, focuses
on early stage opportunities in Internet, communications,
software, semiconductors, medical and consumer branded
sectors. To date, the company has invested over
$700 million in 240 early stage companies.

SWEICKLEY, Penn. -- Adams Capital Management said

firm said its original fundraising goal for its
new fund was $300 million. Investors in the fund
include Allegheny Technologies, Erie Indemnity,
Ft. Washington Investment Advisors, Invesco Private
Capital, State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio,
and the University of Richmond. The firm said the
new fund would increase its level of investment

o Security Firm Appgate Raises $10.2 Million Third Round

STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- Bure Equity, which provides

SEK 7 million ($716,000) in security company Appgate

through CR&T and Innovationskapital, Bure Equity's
ownership in Appgate now amounts to 42.5 percent.
Appgate was originally part of CR&T, a Bure-owned
company. The company said it would use the funds
to expand into the U.S. and Great Britain. Appgate's
product is a security program which protects networks
against attacks from within and allows the system
administrator to define rights of access at a very
detailed level. T-Venture, the corporate venture
capital arm of Deutsche Telekom, took a 10% equity
stake in Appagate in its second round in January.
In its first round AppGate sold a 10% stake to Norwegian
Fund for $1.4 million.

The EES VaR for today is $17.9 million, up from $16.9 million yesterday, due 
to the additional short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The VaR 
should decrease once the short positions related to the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from 
4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received this, 
but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really fun 
activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit 
with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing 
with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for 
a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in 
your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of 
exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within 
the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and 
appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension 
x54070.

Thank you,
Billy

Greg, how big was that last check you told me to watch for. I will transfer 
the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to close at 68 
47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas lower today. I 
will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished. Also, will today's 
announcement about ENE effect you? Ben

My view is that we should go ahead and accept the ICE offer.  Please proceed 
with
the acceptance offer unless someone has a strong objection in which case let's
discuss on Tuesday.

Subject: Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's 
Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no 
later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) 
inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept 
the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our 
shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And 
assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason 
for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, 
if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business 
on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

   Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based
     Employee Referral Program.

     This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs.
     Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of
     quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals
     stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through
     other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee
     referral program with less work and better results.

     There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is
     hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

     So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and
     help us realize our mission of being the?World's No. 1?Company.

     Check out the site - let us know what you think -- we want to hear
     from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if
     you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail
     (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713)
     345-3254, option 2.

CALIFORNIA  SITUATION CLARITY IMPROVING; MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FAVORABLE FOR
ALL
* While we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate
freeze for EIX or PCG out of the California Public Utility Commission
meeting today, we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent
comments.
* In our view, acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic
reconciliation and it now appears that California utilities are on the path
towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain
solvent.
* We believe this has implications not only for the health of the
affected utilities, but also for the Growth Energy Merchants and Competitive
Generators.
* While the credit risk associated with utilities' power market
purchases have not been solved yet, the credit risk in the California market
has eased somewhat.
* While trading may be choppy as the final California remedy is
hammered out, we recommend the purchase of the Growth Energy names
throughout any near-term weakness possible as a result of the process.
* Decision expected today at 4:00 PM EST.

Greg, 

the e-mails below outline my ideas for an improved commercial effort in the 
South American region, including the offer to discuss (as objectively as 
possible) a critical review of our managerial, execution and employee 
strengths and weaknesses in the region. 

I am trying to schedule meetings in Houston during the week of Nov 20 in 
order to finalize in the recent transition and restructuring a position 
remaining with Enron - but including a priority to remain in Brazil, given 
it's enormous and, at least for Enron, as yet largely unrealized potential.  

I've isolated business units in Bundled Products and Networks, separately 
from core Origination and Trading, in the Org Chart graphics below and 
propose that my capabilities and interest might be best leveraged with clear 
deliverables and responsibility for these units.   

You and I didn't have the chance to discuss commercial opportunities in the 
region more completely, but the Bundled Products and Networks units might 
better be combined, given that there are several transactions that would 
easily include bundling potential Enron Networks "products" (e-platforms, EOL 
(commitment of physical product in exchange for EOL marketing, etc.,..)  into 
a transaction.

Appreciate any, all inputs and look forward to further discussion.

David/John - 

Does it work to try to schedule a meeting in Houston with you both during the 
week of Nov 20?

As a reminder, I am in a somewhat pressing situation in trying to determine 
whether there is an opportunity to stay in Brazil focussed on commercial 
opportunities, or relocating within Enron - for personal reasons accomodating 
my wife's professional work, relocating only either back to NYC or to 
London.   

I have had a first round of meetings with Enron UK and Enron Houston and 
identified some areas of potential, but my priority would be to stay in 
Brazil, albeit given an improved structure, report, deliverables and 
authority to execute to Enron's potential in the region.

Subject: Brazil Commercial - ** Update Version, delete previous **

David/John - understand the trip will be delayed.    

Proposal Outline has two texts - I. Commercial Strategy and II. Historical 
Perspective.  The Org Charts will need some discussion - particularly in 
regard to the strengths and weakness of employed personnel and urgent need 
for an improved structure. 

Over the FH 2000 and within the new structure with Brett and Joao Carlos 
Albuquerque in place, the Wholesale group and Trading desk seems to have made 
some important strides forward in terms of recruiting some good individuals 
and, in trading terms,  finally executing some fundamental market supply, 
demand and transmission analysis. 

To get into the game quickly and aggressively, though, I think the commercial 
group needs to hire some senior, local trading expertise.  I apoligize, but 
was unable to get in contact with either of these two guys to set up a 
possible meeting this week.  However, they have the local knowledge, trading 
competencies and management experience which I consider needed to catalyze 
the regional effort: 

Axel Hinsch -  Argentine and Cargill employee with several years and broad 
commodity and financial trading, business development and management    
experience, including senior trader for the Bear Stearns Emerging Markets 
equity desks in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Straight up, no ego
   Argentine Country Manager. 

Mark Hoffman - Swiss/Brazilian and Glencore employee with several years 
energy, energy distribution and sugar sector experience; applied commodity    
and financial arbitrage experience in the Brazilian market.   Lot less 
straight forward, but applied knowledge and expertise.
   Senior Originator/Trader.

Please forward any input about your interest in scheduling a meeting either 
open here or in Houston during the week of Nov 20. 



For some perspective on my experience at Enron, let me explaing that I have 
been working in Enron Networks in the region from Q2 '00 and therefore much 
less formally invovled with the trading (Brazil spot market) and Wholesale 
pricing, tarrif issues etc.,.. than at the end of FY1999 when I was directly 
involved in developing our effort to get in the game in understanding the 
spot price formula calculations and exploring arbitrage opportunities in the 
wholesale market.   

I've attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability 
to critically review the commercial (trading and marketing) and managerial 
issues involving the past and future opportunities.

Gentlemen,

Here is a diagram to illustrate connectivity and relationships on our
trading platform. The items illustrated in yellow represent those portions
of our trading platform that would interface with the Enron trading platform
if we were to link Enron's cash markets with futures markets at the
Merchants' Exchange.

In terms of a potential business relationship, it would be a simple matter
for Enron to participate on the Merchants' Exchange as an FCM (the
relationship illustrated here).  Another approach, and one which would be
far more interesting, would be for Enron to participate more deeply in the
exchange, perhaps as as a marketmaker or even as a stakeholder.

Let's talk further.

Calif Assembly GOP Releases 'Plan R' To Rescue Elec Utils Updated:
Wednesday, May 23, 2001 04:14 PM ET
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California's Assembly Republicans on Wednesday
released "Plan R", an alternative to Democratic proposals on how to restore
the state's financially struggling utilities to solvency.
The plan put forth by the Republicans, who are in the minority in the
Assembly, would have Edison International,  Southern California Edison and
PG&E Corp. pay down debts by way of a dedicated-rate component taken from
existing utility rates, including a rate hike effective March 27.
Plan R would also increase the utilities' future return on investment, and
allow for cost recovery in the future, a press release said. The utilities
have incurred more than $14 billion in undercollections because under a rate
freeze they couldn't pass high wholesale power costs to customers. Utility
rates are frozen through March 2002, unless state regulators decide to lift
the freeze sooner.


To help lower rates, utilities would be required under Plan R to produce
more short-term and long-term power as well as sign long-term contracts to
hedge against real-time price spikes. Lower rates would also come from
negotiating reduced prices for power bought from qualifying facilities and
from negotiating with larger generators to accept only 70% of the money they
are owed for past power deliveries.


"The critical element (of a 30% concession) must come from the governor's
leadership," said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox. "Republicans aren't
going to support any plan without a comparable negotiated concession from
generators by the governor."


The governor met with generators two weeks ago and asked them to accept 70
cents on the dollar from utilities. Most haven't said definitively whether
they are willing to accept those terms, although Reliant (REI, news, msgs)
has flatly refused to accept less than 100%.


Plan R is a response to Gov. Gray Davis' plan to buy SoCal Ed's transmission
lines for $2.76 billion and to help the utility issue $3 billion in bonds
backed by ratepayer revenue.


"The Republican plan is a shared solution that delivers more power to the
grid. The governor's plan socks ratepayers with a staggering bill for
transmission line junk," said GOP Assemblyman Keith Richman.


Davis' agreement with SoCal Ed, announced more than five weeks ago, has
gotten a cold reception from Democrats as well, who have proposed several
"Plan B" alternatives, two of which are being taken more seriously than
others.


One would have the state hold a five-year option to buy SoCal Ed's
transmission lines for their $1.2 billion book value, and would allow the
utility to sell bonds backed by ratepayers for an amount determined by state
regulators. That plan would also require the utility's creditors to accept
75 cents on the dollar for money owed.


The other Plan B would allow Pacific Gas and Electric to issue bonds secured
by their assets and use the revenue to pay creditors. In turn, the utility
would pay an assessment, essentially a tax that would be used to service its
debt.


The Republicans' Plan R applies to both utilities, a spokeswoman for the
Assembly Republican Caucus said. It is meant, in part, to move things
forward, because the Democratic proposals have encountered slow going as of
late, both Democrats and Republican lawmakers say.


"Plan B has become Plan Backtrack," Cox said. "It is time to consider other
options."


But the Republican plan doesn't really offer much that is new, noted one
consumer advocate. Democrats are already pushing for generators to accept
less than what they are owed, as well as for long-term contracts and
qualifying-facility price reductions, said Michael Shames of the Utility
Consumers' Action Network.


"The irony of the Republican proposal is that it is remarkably similar to
the one being developed by the Democrats. It would appear as though the
Republicans are trying to use a trick that Bill Clinton mastered - taking
the opposition's idea and calling it his own," Shames said.


The plan also doesn't explain how or why utilities would want to get back
into regulated generation, vis-a-vis requiring them to produce more supply,
Shames said. As well, funding the plan within current rates isn't possible,
he said.


"The bottom line is, the Republicans aren't pushing anything new or
exciting. And in one case (funding within give rates), not even feasible.
But I'm glad they are trying. I just wish they'd try harder to do something
in a bipartisan way rather than play political games with the truth," Shames
said.

Louise,
I was informed today that a PRC rep is either leaving or will not be able to 
perform the function for some reason.  I have asked Shelly Butler to contact 
you and Robert Jones to see if you want to provide a replacement.  I hope 
this works for you.
Thanks Charlene

I understand that due to Greg not responding to your requests, Net Works has 
been removed from the PRC process for Analyst/Associates this year.

Although I understand that reassigning people is out of the question - I 
would like someone present from Net Works to ensure fair representation.  I 
do understand that Analyts and Associates are not represented by their 
management but we do know that there is usually someone else from their group 
present in the room to offer guidance should there be any issues.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Thanks

Louise

I am in complete agreement with the below (except I think the applause for 
our demise was, unfortunately, rather more aggressive!!). This was my first 
exposure to the non-European Steel players and found myself quite amazed at 
the few number of "public" advocates that we had at the conference in 
consideration of what we are offering.  The one-on-one contact with the 
attendees was completely the opposite.  We talked with a broad and numerous 
set of people who, coming to the booth as sceptics (they think that were are 
in the market just to grab the physical business), left with cards in hand 
and future risk management meetings in mind.  Big buyers (eg GE, Emerson) and 
consultants (eg Accenture, McK, etc) were particularly receptive and should 
be courted as public advocates for what we are doing.

Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, "Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had "sold material 
to Enron" and that "Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency."  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. "What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a "spot" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: "The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments."
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: "Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a "break even" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd)."
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: "I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the "Hunts of the steel business" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year."(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: "Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market."
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a "spot" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

Dear Greg,

Thank you for referring me to John Lavorato, who, in turn, referred me to 
Dave Duran and Chis Calger of East and West Power Originaton, respectively.  
I am speaking with Ben Jacoby, who works with Dave Duran, and I am optimistic 
of a potential match between Enron's needs and my career goals.

Best regards,
Manuel

Mr. Whalley

I am e-mailing you this memo after reading an article posted by Enron 
Internal Communications.

I live in Cloquet, Mn. and have been employed by Northern Natural Gas for 20+ 
years. The major employer in town is Potlatch Corp., a paper and pulp mill. 
The Potlatch Corporation has fallen on difficult financial times. There is 
rumor that Stora Enso of Finland is looking at buying the pulp mill. This 
mill has recently gone through a $1 Bil modernization. Included in the 
project is a steam/electric cogen facility. (not sure of capacity) In talking 
to the locals, the largest asset of Potlatch is their ownership of thousands 
of acres of forest land, that should insure raw material for the future.

I apologize if this has wasted your time, but thought that it was worth 
mentioning.

 Please call if there are any questions. 218.384.9208

Steve Dahnke

SUMMARY OF FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECISION

~ A deeply divided Florida Supreme Court has opened up a Pandora's
  box of inconsistent standards, flawed hand counting, and delays
  that call into question Florida's ability to be represented in
  the Electoral College.

~ Further, the court's narrow, liberal majority has made a mockery
  of the idea of "counting every vote" by selecting only certain
  ballots and providing no standard to count them.  The four
  activist justices rewrote Florida's election laws after the
  election -- a clear violation of federal law.

~ Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and
  forceful dissent; concluding:

  ~ "The majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which
    will certainly immediately follow under the United States
    Constitution"

  ~ "The majority's decision to return the case to the circuit
    court for a count of the under-votes from Miami-Dade County or
    all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it
    existed on November 7, 2000..."

  ~ "I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of
    judicial process in this counting contest propels this country
    and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary
    constitutional crisis.

  ~ Judge Wells said the county-by county decision-making on the
    "clear indication of the intent of the voter":  "is fraught with
    equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the
    election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts
    or Congress."

~ For example, in Miami-Dade County, the justices reinstated 168
  votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts
  conducted in only some precincts - all of them overwhelmingly
  Democratic. This would be the ultimate in treating some votes
  differently from others.

~ The Court ordered a recount of all counties' undervotes, but
  there are five major problems:

  ~ First, in many counties the undervotes aren't even segregated,
    so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated. We
    know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other
    degradation of ballots.

  ~ Second, 16 counties don't even know which of their non-votes
    are undervotes and which are overvotes.

  ~ Third, even in counties that have attempted to separate the
    undervote, there are serious problems. In Miami-Dade, the
    number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is
    different from the number identified in the November 8
    machine recount. There can be no confidence that the pool of
    undervotes is untainted and consistent.

  ~ Fourth, the majority accepted two different standards (the
    liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach
    standard) further proving votes are treated differently in
    each county.

  ~ Fifth, as Chief Justice Wells said, the liberal court
    majority failed "to make provision for: (1) the
    qualifications of those who count; (2) what standards are
    used in the count-are they the same standards for all
    ballots statewide or a continuation of the county-by-
    county constitutionally suspect standards; (3) who is to
    observe the count; (4) how one objects to the count; (5)
    who is entitled to object to the count; (6) whether a
    person may object to a counter; (7) the possible lack of
    personnel to conduct the count; (8) the fatigue of the
    counters; and (9) the effect of the differing intra-county
    standards.

DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS

"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution."

Excerpt:

"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that
I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my
colleagues in the majority.  However, I could not more strongly
disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and
prolong this judicial process.  I also believe that the majority's
decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly
immediately follow under the United States Constitution.

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no
foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000,
or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion.  The majority
returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of
under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at best, ambiguous
standards with authority to obtain help from others, the
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally
unknown.  That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems
that the majority creates.

"This case has reached the point where finality must take
precedence over continued judicial process.  I agree with a quote
from John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple
University, when he wrote that, "[t]he margin of error in this
election is far greater than the margin of victory, no matter who
wins."  Further judicial process will not change this self-evident
fact and will only result in confusion and disorder.  Justice
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of
action sixty-four years ago.  I would heed that sound advice and
affirm Judge Sauls.

STATEMENT BY FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A. BAKER, III
December 8, 2000

Ladies and Gentlemen,

This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee.  Two
Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots
in Seminole and Martin counties.  A federal judge ordering the
counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were
not counted for technical reasons.  And of course, the
disappointing 4 to 3 decision of the Florida Supreme Court just
announced, which will require manually recounting tens of
thousands of non-votes and undervotes in all Florida counties that
have not yet had a manual recount - and trying to do so by
December 12.

This is what happens when for the first time in modern history, a
candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of
an election for President.  It is very sad.  For Florida, for the
nation, and for our democracy.

Today's ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of
course a disappointment.  Its reasoning and result place the Court
once again at odds with sound judgments of Florida's lower courts,
the Florida Legislature, local election officials, and, in our
view, the US Supreme Court.  This action will unfortunately
produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise
Florida's votes in the Electoral College.

The ruling of the Florida Court's four justices is flawed in much
the same way we think as its November 21 ruling that was vacated
unanimously by the United States Supreme Court.

Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his
dissent today:
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand the
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution...  [T]he majority's decision to return this
case to the circuit court for a count of the under-votes from
either Miami-Dade County or all counties has no foundation in the
law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at any time
until the issuance of this opinion...  [T]he prolonging of
judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and
this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional
crisis.  I have to conclude that there is a real and present
likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial
damage to our country, our state, and to this Court as an
institution." [pp. 41-42]

We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of
the other four.  We believe this ruling is inconsistent with
Florida law, federal law, and the United States Constitution.
Therefore, we have no alternative other than to appeal once again
to the United States Supreme Court for relief.  We have already
put in motion the process to do so.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Judge Andrew Napolitano  [Fox News Legal Analyst]:  "...what is
this doing?  Changing the rules yet again, in the face of a federal
law that says you can't change counting procedures and rules after
six days prior to the election."
-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00


Jim Axelrod [CBS News Correspondent]: "One of the first people I
saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass, a member of
the Gore legal team.  I asked him what was next.  He said, 'Chaos.'
So far, nothing's been done to help clarify the situation."
-CBS Evening News, 12/08/00


Tim Russert  [NBC News]:  "...we could have chaos and a
constitutional crisis...This is as close to a political civil war
as I've ever witnessed."
-NBC Nightly News, 12/08/00


Mike Isikoff  [Newsweek Magazine]:  "...The Republicans got a bit
of a shot in the arm.  I was just reading the dissent of Chief
Justice Wells on this case, and he is pretty stinging.  It is
surprising language from a chief justice of a state court.  He
pretty much says flatly that his colleagues were wrong as a matter
of law.  They're going to be reversed by--he predicts they will be
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and also projects--talks about
a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this.  So if
the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on, they've
got it in this dissent..."

John Gibson:  "Mike Isikoff, a crucial question is here.  What
standard is this recount going to be counted under?  Any clue?"

Mike Isikoff:  "No.  That is exactly the question that I think is
going to loom largest over the next few days."

-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to "soak up liquidity" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself," said 
Altra's Coleman. "But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another." 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply "providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace." 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "Big Brother" 
of the energy marketplace. 

"The historical information is not available," EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well." He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

Iridium satellites may go down in flames 
Iridium, a U.S. satellite telephone company operating under bankruptcy 
protection, is on the verge of one
   of the most spectacular business flameouts ever--literally set to burn up 
billions of dollars' worth of
 Earth-orbiting assets.  Barring the last-minute arrival of a qualified 
buyer, the company plans to begin
 "de-orbiting" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit 
system for wireless telephone service.  
 That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported 
to have cost $5 billion to $7
billion--would be vaporized as its satellites, bumped by their thrusters, 
plunge from 485 miles (781 km)
 above the Earth to burn up over the ocean.

cellular phones with Internet
capability; and via pagers manufactured by Research in Motion (RIM).

E-commerce firms hip to B2B before it was hot 
   Business-to-business e-commerce is all the rage these days, but a few 
consumer e-commerce companies such as eBay
   entered the market before it was hot.   The leading auction house opened a 
small-business exchange today
 where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But 
the move is more of a change in marketing
 than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been 
quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its
 format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as 
AutoExchange and Chemdex.

NetTrends: Battle of the E-Marketplace
 Everybody wants to be a marketplace.
In sectors from cars to chemicals to food ingredients, companies are trying 
to join all of
 the participants into Internet-based markets for their industries in hopes 
of making businesses more efficient.
In some cases, they're taking the idea a step further, setting up virtual 
markets that
collect fees for all of the goods traded, creating what they hope are highly 
valued companies in the process.
Agricultural giant Cargill was the latest to join the trend, creating a 
market for the $300 billion food industry this week. The Big
Three automakers recently launched a combined e-commerce venture for auto 
parts ordering that they said would handle $500
billion in parts ranging from glass to semiconductors.

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Tom,

Sorry about the phone tag.  I was calling to determine next steps re: Enron.
The last, I believe, was that you were going to get together with your team
to discuss possibilities.

Hope all is well.

Got anyone down in Texas that can count votes...accurately? :)

Forgive the rough formatting, but this is a rush report...

My analysis- it is significant that both Dems and Repubs are talking about 30 
percent haircuts, but there is not yet an agreement on what to do with the 
transmission lines.

RJ




Source X reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B
proposal:

- Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however,
is that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component,
and too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the
bonds.)
- The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We
think this is doable."
- The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
- Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation
by the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these
plants.
- Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

- Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying
to work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they
feel "frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward
having an option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the
Republicans oppose.

Source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:

- The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this
may be unnecessary.

- The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:

- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a
dedicated rate component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of
their claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated
through a dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to
strike a deal for PG&E.

- Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:

- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell
of pieces of the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a
lifetime stipulation on how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little
as $5 billion if it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the
bankrutpcy judge to quell the protests against such a plan that would very
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly believe that the Judge Montali would
support this idea.

The following represents a sampling of my accomplishments for 2000.

1. The creation of the Hawaii 125-0 concept - the creation of a revolver for 
FASB 125 transactions.  The deal will ultimately be fully utilized and has 
saved significant fees for Enron as well as eased execution of those deals 
(single source of equity, etc)

2. The concept of an internet-distributed $3 Bln Revolver - Initiated the 
concept of the distribution of the revolver over the internet which led to 
the launch of Dealbench.

3. The initiation and execution of project Grayhawk - Initiated the idea to 
take a large ENE stock position in January prior to the ENE equity analyst 
conference and led the deal team which executed the trade.  The transaction 
generated $85MM in profits for EGF.  In addition, identified tax leakage in 
the existing structure which was remedied.  Sure it looks like a no-brainer 
now, but it wasn't at the time.

4. Enron NetWorks, Enron Industrial Markets - Regional CFO - Financed MG 
acquisition,  created financing strategy for group and specific transactions.

5. Enron NetWorks Partners, L.P. - Structured and executed private equity 
fund which will raise 
$900MM of outside equity dollars.  Fund will close by year-end.

6. Created structure to monetize existing Pulp & Paper business through FASB 
125 or alternate structure to capture $75MM - $100MM in earnings and 
approximately $200MM in funds flow.

Please make sure that everyone in your group is aware of this.  There are 2 
Tim Jones, Timothy Jones at ET&S and Tim R Jones in London.  Timothy Jones 
with ET&S has been receiving several emails (like the one below) intended for 
Tim R Jones in London due to user error and I am trying to minimize the 
amounts of email like this that he receives.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: SFA - UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION

I am writing to ask if there are any changes to your personal details 
originally forwarded to the SFA.

As you will recall, in obtaining your registration with the SFA, we were 
required to provide to the SFA information about you, including your personal 
details.  Enron must keep this information up-to-date.  If these details, or 
your SFA status, change in any way, the SFA must be notified within seven 
days.  It is important that you take a few moments to consider the points set 
out below, otherwise Enron will be in breach of its obligations under the SFA 
Rules.

Accordingly, if your details referred to below have changed recently (e.g.  
because you have got married or moved house), or will change in the near 
future, please let me know immediately:

1. personal details (name, address)

2. you are subject to a criminal conviction, regulatory investigation or 
civil litigation (other than as a witness)

3. category of registration (eg your registration will change from Trader to 
Representative or Director)

4.  changes in any directorships you hold 

5. internal transfer (ie if you have changed departments within Enron)

6. change in role (ie your job within your department changes)

7. if you plan to leave Enron and have a departure date

Many thanks.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the 
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of 
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and 
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each 
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and 
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following 
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, 
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these 
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how 
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful 
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down 
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or 
malicious code.

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Enron Reuters folder: FRANCE: Metals web platform EMETRA may add 
ferro-alloys.


FRANCE:
Metals web platform EMETRA may add ferro-alloys.

11/20/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

PARIS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Metals internet trading exchange EMETRA may add
selected ferro-alloys to its existing range of non-ferrous metals products,
Heinz Schimmelbusch, managing director of Safeguard International Fund, said
on Monday.

Safeguard has a stake in EMETRA, alongside Enron Metals and Internet Capital
Group .
"There's no reason why tin or nickel are being traded on and certain
ferro-alloys are not being traded," Schimmelbusch said at a Metal Bulletin
conference in Paris.

"One would be tempted to add ferro-alloy industry standards to these new
exchange-based trading operations."

EMETRA launched physical trade of non-ferrous metals in October via its
website at www.emetra.com.

A derivatives platform, developed in conjunction with Deutsche Boerse, is due
to follow in the first quarter of next year.

Futures and derivatives are the key to adding value to ferro-alloys trade via
e-commerce, Schimmelbusch said.

"I don't think that physical platforms add anything unless they're connected
to futures pricing," Schimmelbusch said, citing the volatile nature of
ferro-alloys markets and the need to provide a transparent hedging mechanism.

Such hedging mechanisms that existed in the industry were confined to
privately negotiated deals, he added.

But as business migrated to web-based platforms more formal futures markets
might emerge, he said, pointing out that ferroalloy producers could already
offset power cost risk through a range of trading options.

"In the future it will be possible to lock in margins and eliminate volatility
over certain periods of time, and at a much lower cost than can be done
privately now," he said.

EMETRA was founded in February as a joint venture between LME ring trader MG
Plc - subsequently bought by U.S. energy and power giant Enron Corp - Internet
Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund LP.

We all attended (parts of) a day long event which I believe Vince is hosting 
on Wharton and a project they are doing for us, I personally would like to 
see the results of that before doing more with Wharton as overall Vince and 
Jeff Shankman have Wharton pretty well covered.

Subject: Wharton

Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! 
(details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many 
eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced 
web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from 
leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums 
(coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which 
Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there 
may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level 
discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for 
the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions 
among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and 
other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for 
new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor 
participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate 
executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a 
high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and 
corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to 
DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels 
above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is 
intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity 
in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work 
from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, 
references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in 
this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and 
other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and 
participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very 
frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded 
our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there 
someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, 
interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you 
involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the 
time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to 
participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an "Enron 
brain drain" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate 
concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly 
to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable 
telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the 
WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at 
other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Subject: ICG/Wharton Forum meeting May 31-June 1


Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the "From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:

Dorothy,

Per our discussion, Ken and Kevin would like Greg Whaley and Cliff Baxter to 
interview a candidate for a VP, Network Engineering and Operations in EBS.  
His name is Doug Kelly and he is tentatively scheduled to see Ken and Kevin 
on Monday, November 20.  Mr. Kelly has already interviewed with Kevin and 
several of EBS management.  He is our top candidate for this role and we are 
trying to move quickly.

I appreciate you sending a note to both Greg and Cliff's assistants regarding 
their availability to interview Mr. Kelly.

They can contact Gloria Alvarez at 58059 to coordinate.  

Thanks

Things are definitely getting interesting.  As we reported on Wednesday, the 
first glimmers of hope for a deal in the Assembly are starting to appear on 
the horizon.  The market may react positively to this news as it filters out 
over the next week.  Of course, a bailout deal for SoCal could be rejected by 
SoCal or the generators could refuse to participate and bankruptcy could 
still happen.  Nonetheless, we felt it was important to alert you to the 
changing dynamics in the legislature.

RJ

Executive Summary:

? Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking 
for a realistic Plan B
? The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% 
generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued 
oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will 
probably pass the legislature
? The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees 
from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court.

1. Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal

According to sources, the Assembly is "terrified"  of the current holes in 
the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is 
reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be 
moving a SoCal bailout plan forward.
 
 Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  "not that far off"; it will 
likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal 
through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is 
introduced.
 
2. What Would the New Plan B Look Like?

- This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will 
almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's 
undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated 
rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 
70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the 
possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state 
is "fairly confident" that at least most generators  would not be successful 
in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly 
remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from 
within his office.
 
3. Transmission Lines

- It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or 
option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of 
contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the 
Assembly is "working on  this."

4. Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate 

- According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the 
above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet 
settled) "looks very good."  The vote in the Senate would  be "very close."  
Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not 
stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more 
likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer 
advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are 
better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly "pessimistic" about their 
chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point.

5. Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End
 
- As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would 
be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state 
offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the 
state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources 
report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be 
offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time 
that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid 
immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated 
rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay 
back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents 
on the dollar.
 
- Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from 
filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, 
since it would pay back most of what they are  owed.
 
6. PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In
 
- If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy 
court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can 
be offered at any time within  PG&E's "period of exclusivity."  This is a 
90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a 
bankruptcy petition.
 
- However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach 
the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources 
within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its 
sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This 
is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high.
 
7. Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure

- Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to 
pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost 
increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, 
this plan does not make the crisis go  away.

I echo Paul's comments.  This is a tremendously important transaction to 
Enron and could not have been done without the efforts of the entire team.

Conagratulations to the entire team on the closing and thank you for both the 
effort and the creativity.

		 Subject: $2.15 bn Enron Metals Inventory Financings Closed

Last Tuesday Global Finance Europe closed  a new off balance sheet facility 
with Barclays creating up to $1bn of capacity for existing and new physical 
metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines    

Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort

1. Bond Authorization Passes Senate On Party Lines; 90 Days Wait for Bond 
Money Begins

The Senate just passed bill SB 31X on a vote of 22-15 on party lines.
There was no crossover by Republicans.

*.  Sen. Burton indicated that we need to solve the problems and that the
problems were caused by the unfettered greed of the generators.  He stated
that if the MOU does move forward, he would insist that the generators take
a 30% haircut on monies owed because that is better than they would get in
bankruptcy court.

*. Republican Opposition:  Senators McClintock and Ackerman spoke against
the bill.  Arguments were basically about the use of revenue bonds and the
interest that taxpayers would have to pay.  They also made arguments about
the fact that the Governor's projections for conservation and rate increases
are not accurate.

*. Senator Peace gave his "usual speech" blaming the FERC for the situation
and indicated that Legislators have sued FERC over their inaction and said
that CA would win that battle and would get its money back.

2. Windfall Profit Tax Bill Goes Down to the Wire

There are indications that the Assembly Democrats intend to try to pass a
significant amount of legislation on Thursday in advance of an end to the
extraordinary session.  The priority remains SB 28X, a siting bill that has
been sent back to the Assembly.  (Sources report that there is disagreement
about the unemployment compensation terms laid out in this bill.)  According
to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in committee
in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a vote
tomorrow; we will continue to examine this issue.

Post our exceptionally productive meeting today, I thought I would summarize 
where I thought we ended up, or where at least we should have ended up.

Jim is going to forward the specfication for Enfibre (only Enfibre) to 
Philippe.
Philippe will provide a team of people (from where is his choice) with no 
payments to be made to any other groups
Philippe will provide Jim with a price (the price will include a daily rate 
per person) for the specific project included in the scope and not the 
ongoing O&M etc
Jim then decides whether he wants to commence work with Net Works on this 
project or he adopts a different apporach.

Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and 
running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come 
along.

Greg,
After our discussion yesterday, thought you might be interested in presenting 
our views on corporate venturing.  This was an invitation for Jeff, but he 
will be in a San Fran meeting and won't be able to make it.

  Mr. Alkhayat:

     Thank you for talking with me earlier. Enron's innovative corporate
venturing is a key part of one of Harvard Business School Publishing's new
best-sellers, Gary Hamel's "Leading the Revolution." Now, we're eager to
extend that conversation about innovative strategy approaches with an
upcoming conference in New York 

   We've targeted a small group of leaders to come together to talk about
strategies for innovative programs that contribute to the corporate bottom
line, both financially and strategically. We're calling this one-day
conference Corporate Venturing: Strategic Investing on Innovation's Edge.

   Ken Chenault, the COO and president of American Express and Michael
Ruettger, the CEO of EMC have both agreed to be part of the program, which
is now scheduled as a half-day gathering on Thursday, Feb. 8.  We would very
much like to have Mr. Skilling be a part of a panel/roundtable discussion
about ways corporations are exploring new technology and markets, generating
new business and creating new value. Mr. Skilling's experience in Enron's
strategic venturing "from the inside out" would be a particularly valuable
part of the discussion.

   This is going to be a small conference, limited to about 50 to 75
attendees in the audience, so there can be lively discussion. I know I speak
for HBSP and for our co-sponsor, Bain & Co., that Mr. Skilling would be an
important part of what is shaping up to as a very interesting conference. We
at HBSP believe this newly-launched conference series will become an
important part of our publishing and content development.

   Let me know if I can supply more information. Attached are our "thought
outlines" for topics that the panel would discuss.

Angelia

P.S. The panel line up now includes, Paul Guehler, VP of R&D at 3M, Rich
Bressler, CEO Time Warner Digital, Henry Chesbrough of HBS, Susan Mayer,
President MCI WorldCom Venture Fund, Brenda Gavin, President SR1 Fund,
SmithKline Beecham, Petra Koselka from Shell. We apparently have a
commitment from Cargill, but it's not in final final confirmation! 
  

   
     Agenda

Corporate Venturing
Strategic Investing on Innovation's Edge

Corporate venturing is the new engine behind the growth and revitalization
of companies that need to take advantage of technology and markets, expand
into new businesses and find strategic partners.

The corporate venturing conference will explore the strategies for venture
programs that contribute to the corporate bottom line - both financially and
strategically. Strategists and practitioners will lead discussions about the
best models for investing in innovation outside the corporation, as well as
managing the venture to ensure success. Topics will include corporate
venturing trends, managing the integration and relationship with emerging
companies, when and how to attract outside capital, and issues surrounding
retention, compensation and the spin-off of a corporate venturing fund.

This conference, limited to 50 to 75 attendees, is intended for CEOs, COOs,
CFOs, division presidents and other operating officers.


Program Outline

Thursday, February 8, 2001
The Four Seasons
New York

7:30 a.m. Breakfast

8 a.m. Opening session
A Conversation with Ken Chenault,  President and COO, American Express  

8:45 a.m. First Presentation:
           The Venture Capital Revolution: An Overview 
                             
     Corporate venture programs followed a start-and-stop pattern of growth
over the last 25 years.  But in the past decade, the number of corporate
funds and the size of their investments skyrocketed. What is behind these
dramatic changes,  as corporations move to harness the venture capitalists'
model. Why should  "outsourcing innovation" be a part of your growth
strategy? 

9 a.m. First Panel
             The Strategic Venture: When to Reach Outside

       Corporate venturing is a complex undertaking. Research shows that
success depends on carefully targeted planning to integrate R&D strategy
functions and the corporate venture. This panel focuses on these questions: 

*   When do you know it is time to set up an independent business?
*   How do you think about venturing vs. expanding your core business? 
*   How are companies in every industry using corporate venture capital
as a tool to identify and develop new products ahead of the competition, as
well as create new partnerships?
*   What are the key measures successful companies use to determine
where and how dollars are invested in outside innovation? How can decisions
about what  NOT to invest in shape the funds direction?
*   How do successful companies balance the competing demands for fast
direct financial return versus long-term indirect gains in R&D? 
*   What are the strategic advantages in traditional funds, partnerships
with venture capitalists and hybrid forms?

BREAK


10:30 a.m. A Conversation with Michael Ruettgers, CEO, EMC 


   

  11:50 a.m. Second Panel
           Managing the Venture: Partnerships and Opportunities

      A strong corporate venture program must align  the activities of the
innovators, operational partners and equity partners,, inside and outside
the  company This panel focuses on  these questions:

*   What kind of governance and oversight relationships should the
corporation build with emerging companies, to leverage innovation without
stifling new ideas?
*   Do new technology buildouts demand a different kind of management?
*   How does the corporate "exit strategy" - public offerings vs.
acquisition --  affect investments and partnerships?
*   How can  an internally generated idea for a new business be
"spun-out", funded and managed as an "outside venture? 
*   How have compensation concerns put increasing pressures on corporate
venture programs?

The Texas eCommerce Association, in partnership with the The Texas Business 
Journals and BusinessWeek, plan to recognize and honor Texas' ten most 
innovative and influential eCommerce leaders.  Nominations are due by 
February 2, 2001 and the recipients will be announced at a banquet on March 
24, 2001.

I believe it would be appropriate to nominate Louise Kitchen for her work 
with EnronOnline.  If you are in agreement, please advise, so I can begin the 
process of completing the application.  The application consists of a 
250-word abstract describing the nominee's direct contribution to the 
eCommerce industry in Texas, along with the nominee's contact information and 
a 100-word biography.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053.

Dear Friend:

America has a serious energy shortage and President Bush has a comprehensive 
plan to address it.  Please follow this link to read the President's 
comprehensive energy plan as well as to view the speech he delivered 
yesterday in St. Paul, Minnesota: http://www.BushEnergy.com.

The President's plan to produce more reliable, affordable and environmentally 
clean energy is built on three core principles:

--The plan is comprehensive and forward looking.

--It uses 21st century technology to allow us to promote conservation and 
diversify our energy supply.

--The plan will increase the quality of life of Americans by providing 
reliable energy and protecting the environment.

While President Bush is showing strong leadership on a long neglected 
problem, some want to protect the status quo of higher prices, less supply 
and more neglect.  WE NEED YOU TO HELP PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN BY:

1. Writing a letter to the editor about the President's comprehensive energy 
plan.  Go to http://www.BushEnergy.com for sample letters and your 
newspaper's address.

2. Calling talk radio in your area to discuss the President's leadership on 
the energy issue.  Visit http://www.BushEnergy.com for contact numbers.

3. Forwarding this message to five friends

4. Call your Congressman and Senators to urge them to support the President's 
plan.  For contact numbers, go to http://www.BushEnergy.com.

You can also help Republican National Committee efforts to pass the 
President's comprehensive energy plan.  Please make an online contribution 
today by using this secure link: 
https://www.econtributor.net/Contribution/Contribution.cfm?AID=ITYPOWNPZHII

Sincerely,

Governor Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Greg,
You're absolutely correct (obviously), and I actually noted that when I first 
started sending that chart out. I did that so that they would be more in 
scale and fit on the same chart. The chart is provided only to identify the 
trend of our performance relative to the NYMEX. Perhaps I should note each 
day that these volumes have been adjusted so as not to be misleading. Or, if 
you wish, I could stop adjusting the numbers and just chart the absolute 
values.
Please let me know which you would prefer.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

your volume comparison chart is off by a factor of 10.  each contract is 1000 
bbls.

The following is a list of deals and/or issues that affect industrial
verticals (obviously you have more on your plate when you take into account
EOL, coal, other investments, etc...)

Pulp & Paper - Get a JV set up with industry partners to grow ENA book,
create value and change industry.  Initially Enron driven deal.  IPO if
necessary.

Steel - Investment in e-Steel plus attempt to build a steel book.  IPO or
not will be driven by current owners.

Phelps Dodge/Alcoa - See description on Pulp & Paper

PetChems/Plastics/NGLs - Leverage ChemConnect or build on our own like Pulp
& Paper and/or PD/Alcoa

MG Metals

Meetings - ChemConnect  CEO meeting as well as meeting with Internet
Capital Group MD (attended by Whalley?)

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on "negawatts" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the "Information Economy" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. "Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to," Davis declaimed. 
"Take" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. "Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders," reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
"They took the money and ran," said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

We are completing a telephone systems audit that involved sweeping executive 
and executive assistant telephones and workspaces for listening devices.  
This sweep included your telephone(s).
 
On Thursday, November 9, the following tests were conducted by Swailes and 
Associates and CTF Specialists under the supervision of Corp. Security:

Each office was swept for radio frequency listening devices
Each telephone was opened and physically inspected
Each telephone line was checked for downline listening devices
All executive and assistant extensions were programmatically evaluated to 
determine whether secondary, unknown telephones were associated with the same 
extension

No problems were found.

Thanks,

Dan Eilers of Vanguard Venture Partners contacted me last week to see if 
Enron would be interested in a high level discussion of the changes occurring 
in electricity generation and management technologies.  Vanguard is an early 
stage VC fund that helped create Ciena and Network Appliance.  Dan is a new 
partner and is looking at the energy market as a new focus for Vanguard.  

He would like to have a brainstorming session with an eye on creating a 
cooperative relationship between Vanguard and Enron for the evaluation and 
development of new companies in the energy arena.

I would appreciate it if you could respond with your interest level so I 
could arrange a time that is convenient for each of you to participate.

Thanks,
Mark

		 Subject: Energy investing...brainstorming and perspective sharing between 
Vanguard Ventures and Enron...

Many thanks for meeting with Bob and I last week.
How ironic to find you working with one of my 
graduate school classmates, Gene Humphrey.

As we discussed, Vanguard is interested in exploring
what kinds of opportunities may exist for venture 
investment in the energy arena.  We think that
the ultimate "internet (and everything) infrastructure" play is about clean,
always on, electrical power.  While we are not experts in the area,
and are not yet certain it will be a productive area for venture
capital investment of the type Vanguard does, we feel 
that there is a sufficient market need in multiple segments that 
there MAY be such an investment opportunity which it
would make sense for us to pursue as an investment
focus area.  This could have value for Enron should
we determine investment areas which are symbiotic
with Enron and which we could collaborate on, as we
help catalyze/create/fund exciting new companies.

As we discussed we would love to participate in a brainstorming and 
perspective setting session with visionary and strategic Enron executives
who
have domain knowledge and an interest. Our potential interest areas span 
from generation (alternatives, distributed, and conventional) 
to transmission to distribution to storage...fixed and mobile.  
We appreciate your offer to pull together an Enron group for such 
a brainstorming...and I would be quite happy to fly down to 
Houston again in order to engage in such a session.

As always we appreciate your interest in Vanguard.

Best,

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Regards

The following is a status update regarding the agreed upon decision to 
allocate Drift to the Business Units on April 26, 2001:

 A methodology and systems reporting have been developed and an analysis 
prepared for the period Jan 2001 - April 2001.  During May, discussions were 
held with each of the business units regarding the methodolgy which applies 
to all business units and the analysis of results for Jan- April.  

A request was made to begin the Drift Allocation process from April 2001.  

During this week, we are meeting with the business units to review April and 
May numbers and processes.  We are expecting to allocate April and May to the 
individual business unit's Drift lines next week.   

June numbers will be accumulated on the DPR in an Intra-Month Allocated Drift 
line and allocated on the last business day's DPR to the Business Unit.

 Please do not hesitate to call me, 3-3210,  or the representatives of your 
business unit,  if you require additional information.

Sheila

Three headed monster, (Dave, Ken and Greg)

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

Thanks,

KG

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

Following the Dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news," Dabhol is getting 
some good news this week.

As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB 
purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially 
misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual 
ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).  However, the letter 
goes on to state that MSEB is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement 
of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum."  
We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for 
clarification.  Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our 
already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to 
be bound by the PPA.

While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of 
the PPA, the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on 
the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a 
competent authority."  We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra 
Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a "how much should we pay DPC" 
determination.  If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help 
our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.

DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in 
May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 
days.  While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I 
believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to 
give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing 
project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.

Bruce

Just FYI---we will NOT be mentioning Enron's name in the Allegheny Press 
Release that each of you have approved. Per Allegheny's request, we are 
deleting the sentence in the 1st paragraph which mentions that Las Vegas 
Cogeneration II is owned by Southwest Power, an affiliate of Enron North 
America. Everything else in the Press Release will stay the same.  

Allegheny asked that Enron NOT be included in the release, as they feel we 
have different approaches/philosophies in the marketplace, and they believe 
it may send a mixed message. However, there is not any sort of 
confidentiality agreement regarding the transaction, therefore we are 
certainly free to talk about it publicly. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I apologize for the multiple 
emails regarding this release--we just wanted everyone to be in the loop on 
all the changes. 

I have attached the FINAL Press Release for your files--this will be released 
by Allegheny on Friday morning, 5/11.

Thanks,

Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and 
responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great 
application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever 
increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like 
to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we 
mean by "outsourcing" your mid and back office functions to our 
"ProsessCo/ServiceCo."  I think we have identified what types of services we 
could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk 
reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, 
nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash 
payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully 
makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your 
growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, 
comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial 
easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

Piper


PS  Let's do another dinner with McGowan, etc. soon (or play golf some time 
or catch some beers).

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

ENW Ventures Portfolio News

Acta Announces Partnership With i2; i2 Customers Can Now Choose Acta's 
Rapid-to-Implement Data Integration Products to Collaborate Intelligently 
Across the Supply Chain

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 11, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, today announced a 
technology partnership with i2 Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITWO), the leading 
provider of marketplace solutions. 
The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
"B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems," said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. "Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online." 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence.

traded Internet-based pricing system, said it laid
off 48 employees, 11% of its staff, and trimmed
several business offerings under development in
a bid for profitability.

o Softbank Confirms Accelerator eVentures Halts Operations

NEW YORK -- Softbank, an Internet and technology
investor, said its U.K.-based eVentures Fund, set
up as a joint venture with ePartners, the venture
capital arm of News Corp., in mid-1999 to help U.S.
technology firms launch in Western Europe, has put
on hold all investments plans due to current market
conditions. A company spokeswoman said until market
conditions change, Softbank will refocus its resources
on making direct early stage investments through
Softbank UK Ventures and Softbank European Ventures.
eVentures is not the only Softbank-affiliated fund
that has been frozen. @Viso, a $344.5 million-joint
venture fund between Softbank and Vivendi, a global
utilities and communications company, has also halted
its investments plans.

Thank you for arranging the meeting  yesterday.
In rough outline I described a trading activity  where the activity would 
include 2-3 million tons per annum of ammonia with  similar volumes in each 
of the other primary items handled which would include  phosphate 
rock,sulfuric acid,DAP,urea,urea ammonium nitrate solutions,and  sulfur. In 
the course of our discussion it was correctly noted that the scope of  the 
base trading income anticipated would fall in the range of $50-$70million  
per annum and? that was short of the mark you would like to see in your  
evaluation.?
I would comment that there will be better years but  to average much above 
these objectives will be unlikely in these markets as they  exist today.
To find more on a consistent basis we would need to  anticipate investments 
in bricks and mortar.?There will be many  opportunities (terminals, shipping, 
handling, production) where we will find a  IRR over 20 with an exit strategy 
of less than five years. These are  opportunities above and beyond the base 
trading income anticipated.
I am posting to you a copy of the data distributed  yesterday.If I can answer 
any questions please let me know.
Kind regards

Dear Christie:

John Roberts suggested I contact you. As I believe he told you, I am running
an MBA course next quarter entitled "Market Design," in which I will examine
how markets are built (ranging from eBay to reforming Russia). Enron, of
course, is a leader in creating markets, so it would be great if someone
from Enron could lead a session.  (650 724 4549) .

Thank you very much.

Regards,
John

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Subject: CPUC Proposed Decision Modifying Negative CTC Recovery

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Jim

Further footnotes on the Democrat and Republican Plan B's.  The key questions 
now are:

1. When will the Democrats announce the Keeley plan?  Will Davis support it?

Best estimate- Davis will support it quietly, but Keeley will take the lead, 
probably announcing an abandonment of the transmission line deal and the new 
plan by the end of the week.

2. How will the generators react to the 70 percent "haircut" proposed by both 
parties?

Best estimate- we will have reports from the generators tomorrow.  An 
argument could be made that the appeal of a quick solution is strong.

3. Will the financial pressure on SoCal force them into b.k. before a deal 
can be put together?

Best estimate- big risk here.  More and more small creditors (QFs, City of 
Long Beach) are going after SoCal assets.  Also, SoCal also warned that if 
the original MOU was altered by the legislature, that they would have to go 
b.k.

We will continue to monitor and update as information comes in.  Until these 
questions are answered, our outlook continues to be for a SoCal b.k. filing.

ENA legal -- Kim Bruno is one of the FERC staff that visited the Enron gas 
and power trading floors last week.  Can you provide us with a response to 
his questions?  I'll set up a conference call if necessary to discuss before 
we respond.  I talked with Kim today and told him that we would be responding 
within several days and he is fine with that.  Thanks.

In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment or 
management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We 
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do 
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness 
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an 
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.

However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort 
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing 
EOL to purchase from Enron?

Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter 
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron 
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

Thank you.

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The power station and LNG contractors terminated their respective 
construction contracts over the weekend.

Rebecca McDonald and Ken Lay met with the India Minister of Finance on 
Saturday in New York.  The Minister reiterated India's position that they 
would not buy any power from Dabhol.

We had a conference call with management of GE and Bechtel last week.  There 
is little evident disagreement amongst the sponsors on key issues.  Bechtel 
even complimented Rebecca on her team and handling of the matter.  Walter 
Stuart from V&E came over to listen in on the phone call on behalf of Enron.  
Given the increasing cooperation of the sponsors and written statements of GE 
and Bechtel approving Enron's handling of ongoing issues, we have kept V&E's 
involvement fairly "low key" to date.

Greg,

I've attached your EOL Palo Verde position.  It shows that you are short 225 
Aug PV on EOL.  You bought 200 from Matt, making your net position short 25.

Let me know if you agree.

Jeff and Greg,

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,
Frank Levy

Hi Greg,
 Just bugging you again about whether or not you'd called Andrew Lawrence at
Longitude.  This is a very interesting and different approach to trading
products (I'm on the board of Longitude, for your information, and I got on
the board because of the very intriguing proposal they have).  I hope you
get a chance to talk with him.  Cheers.  Wendy  PS I have a board meeting
tomorrow afternoon -- we meet every month.

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair 
will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly 
rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or 
capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of 
them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a 
big plane.

Scott asked me to forward you our latest election update. We have been 
writing these since late October when we predicted a 276-262 Bush win in the 
electoral college and even highlighted potential delays connected to the 
overseas military vote in Florida, but no one could have predicted this mess!

Subject: Election Update 11/28


Summary:

Vice President Gore believes he has won the state of Florida and the 
election, and is determined to see
through the raft of legal challenges now launched in Florida state courts. 
Texas Governor Bush doesn't really
care what Gore thinks and is moving on several fronts (including possible 
early cabinet appointments)
to press his increasingly obvious public opinionadvantage.

1. Gore Strategy

Gore and his campaign leaders are watching the Bush strategy and refusing to 
accede to the carefully
crafted sense of "inevitability." "This all fades in a nanosecond if we win 
Florida," one Gore campaign adviser
told us. Gore is still hoping to prevail in one of three legal challenges 
that could make a
difference: the "dimpled chad" recount for Palm Beach and Miami-Dade 
Counties; the "absentee
ballot" fraud suit in Seminole County, and; the "butterfly ballot re-vote" 
scenario for Palm Beach.

In order for Gore to gain the Presidency, these decisions would still have to 
produce enough votes for Gore 
to overtake the 537 vote Bush lead (unlikely in Dade, possible in Palm Beach) 
and then be held up by the US 
Supreme Court.  Of course, the US Supreme Court could simply uphold the 
certification and render the Florida cases
 moot (unless Bush decides to drop the Supreme Court action- see below).

The Seminole County case is regarded as overblown because first, the Voter 
Identification Number
was not required under Florida law only by the local election board and 
second, the Republicans only
had access to the ballots before they were mailed out.

Gore well understands that pursuing these cases in Florida court is losing 
him steady ground in the court of
public opinion. As we wrote yesterday, that opinion is steadily turning 
against Gore's crusade and Bush
plans to do everything in his power over the next few days to accelerate that 
turn. Polls from last night,
before Gore spoke, indicate the vice president's position is continuing to 
erode. The percentage of
Americans who say they are willing to wait "at least a little while longer" 
to resolve this issue has
dropped sharply from 51% last week to 37% last night, while the percentage 
who say Gore should
concede has risen from 46% to 56% in the same series of polls.

2. Bush Strategy

As early as today Bush transition officials tell us he could start naming his 
cabinet and make a
new decision on his US Supreme Court challenge. One thing to keep firmly in 
mind, although the
press is full of Andrew Card news today, the real power of the Bush throne 
will be Vice President
Cheney. He is emerging as the great hope for Bush staffers who are already 
growing frustrated
with the lack of focus and disorientation of Bush's "Texas league" inner 
circle.

In the meantime, don't expect Bush to do anything but seek to accelerate the 
trend in the polls breaking against Gore. 
On one front, Bush is considering a proposal to drop his Supreme Court appeal 
before oral
arguments are heard this Friday. Although he would position this decision as 
a "peace offering" to Gore,
the real reasons are far more self-serving. In the first place, Bush no 
longer gets anything from the Court
(unless Gore wins on one of his new lawsuits, and even then Bush could 
re-file with the Court for relief), but
Gore could get an affirmation that recounts should be conducted; that would 
be a huge victory in the public
opinion arena for the vice president. In the second place, Bush realizes that 
the looming Supreme Court
battle gives Gore what little public relations "cover" he has to pursue all 
the other court battles in Florida --
as long as the election remains undetermined because of Bush's lawsuit, Gore 
can justify asking the
American public to hang on a little longer.

3. Bush Cabinet Appointees Imminent?

But Bush is moving on another front, and he is now expected to name at least 
some of his senior cabinet
appointments as early as this week. The names he is considering are all 
people who have agreed to serve in
his cabinet and whom he has long since chosen to serve. Naming some of the 
new Bush cabinet members
in public, Bush officials believe, would increase the voters' sense that this 
will be a moderate administration
of household names they can trust. That is why the transition team wants to 
announce Colin Powell as
Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice as National Security Advisor and Sam Nunn 
as Defense Secretary as
soon as possible, even though Nunn is playing hard to get. There is a 
complication to the strategy since
Powell wants to avoid becoming a political pawn and Nunn cannot afford to be 
part of this strategy right now,
since enraged Democrats would lynch him for "treason." What Bush wants, of 
course, is a pre-set senior
foreign policy team made up of two African-Americans and a Democrat. 

Only one economic team decision has been made. Bush will name Larry Lindsey 
to one of the top
three economic jobs in the new administration (Treasury Secretary, National 
Economic Council
Director or head of the Council of Economic Advisers) and we expect Lindsey 
to run much of the new
administration's economic policy from whatever slot he eventually occupies. 
Think of this as the Bob Rubin
model. Rubin did not serve as Treasury Secretary during the first Clinton 
period, but ran things from within
the White House.

Greg,

A few months ago I explored the idea of creating an Airline Transport 
Contract for passenger travel.   I discovered that the Air Transport 
Association has been keeping statistics such as Revenue Passenger Miles 
(RPM), Available Seat Miles (ASM) and theirs yields per industry revenues 
since 1945.  For instance, this Revenue yield per passenger mile index had a 
range of 6.9 cents in 1945 and grew to 8.7 cents in 1979 (the last year of 
regulation) and then jumped to 11.0 cents in 1980 and has slowly marched to 
13.1 cents in 1998.  

I thought perhaps Enron could develop a call option contract on passenger 
travel tickets, which would help reduce the approximate $30 to $40 million 
Enron pays each year in corporate airline travel.   If Enron could 
successfully develop this contract with Continental, we could roll it out to 
other large corporations and airlines.  After corporate acceptance, the ATC 
may then become a widely traded contract.

Attached is a conceptual presentation I put together describing the idea.  I 
have already shown this to Dan Reck and Jean Mrha, who both recommended I 
send it off to you.   Let me know if you have any questions.   Thank you.

Regards

John Allario

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen --

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance 
testing, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will 
draw no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing 
availability declarations.  These letters turn the vague "recission" letter 
that we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy 
Regulatory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position 
seems to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC 
is the appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship 
(e.g., determine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the 
misdeclaration claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction 
in this matter and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping 
any arbitration proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a 
petition tor the Bombay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy 
power from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and 
GOM) that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no 
reasonable hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Bruce

There will be a press conference by the Assembly Republicans at 10:30 a.m. 
PDT to announce their counter-proposal to the MOU.  This should give further 
insight and generate market reaction as to whether SoCal can be saved.  The 
Republicans are almost certain to offer something less generous that the 
original Davis transmission line offer.

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School 
Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past 
couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school 
loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, 
eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach 
of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland 
(x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the Florida presidential 
recount, saying Friday it will hear one of George W. Bush's appeals that 
seeks to bar hand-counted ballots in the disputed election. In a stunning 
development and a victory for Bush, the nation's highest court said it will 
hear arguments Dec. 1 on whether to overturn the Florida Supreme Court's 
decision that allowed manually recounted votes to be added to Florida's vote 
total.


_______________________________________________

Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For 
Miami-Dade Recount

"We are pleased with the Supreme Court decision. It was our strong belief 
that the Florida Supreme Court would deny this motion. The court had already 
extended the statutory deadline for an additional 12 days and Al Gore was 
asking them to extend it yet again.

"Thursday night Al Gore thanked the canvassing boards for their hard work and 
praised the Supreme Court decision. Since then he has sued one of those 
canvassing boards and asked the Supreme Court to change its mind. It seems Al 
Gore wants the Court to keep extending the deadline until he can count the 
votes enough times to change the result."

_______________________________________________

Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots

 ~ The Illinois Supreme Court Ruling was incorrectly cited by the Gore 
campaign and the Florida Supreme Court, and does NOT require dimpled ballots 
to be counted.

~ In fact, in the Illinois case, dimpled ballots were not counted at all. 
Illinois attorney Burton Odelson, who represented the challenger in the 1990 
Illinois case, said, "the judge did not count ballots that were indented 
because he could not determine the voters' intent."

~ Contrary to the arguments made by David Boies for the Gore campaign, Cook 
County Circuit Judge Francis Barth said, "I don't believe the fact that an 
impression standing alone counts necessarily that this voter intended then to 
vote."

~ Of the 27 disputed ballots the Illinois Supreme Court ordered Judge Barth 
to examine, he rejected nine dimpled ballots because, as he said, the dents 
were insufficient to prove the voter's intent. He rejected four others with 
pinholes that were misaligned, accepted three "hanging chads," in which the 
perforation was partially attached, and approved five ballots punctured by 
pinholes. Six
disputed ballots were withdrawn.

~ Michael Levelle, a Democrat lawyer representing the Republican candidate in 
Illinois, initially signed an affidavit on behalf of the Gore campaign saying 
to the best of his recollection, he believed Judge Barth counted indented 
ballots. But when later told that Judge Barth did not include dimpled 
ballots, Levelle recanted: "I couldn't
remember details. The affidavit was more general than specific."
_______________________________________________

What About Today's Action on Military Ballots?

~ To protect the rights of our military men and women to have their votes 
count, the Bush-Cheney campaign today is asking a Florida Circuit Court in 
Tallahassee to require canvassing boards to immediately go back and review 
overseas military ballots for inclusion in the final vote tally.

~ We urge Al Gore to support this action.

~ One week ago tonight, in an orchestrated effort that included a five-page 
memo by a Gore attorney, Al Gore's supporters objected to as many military 
ballots as they could find. The Gore campaign never should have knocked out 
the votes of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform.

~ That's no way to treat the men and women who serve our country. They never 
should have taken that action in the first place.

~ Today is the day to right this wrong.

~ A State Judge will conduct a hearing at 2:00 today in Leon County to hear 
our case. We hope the Judge will ask the Boards to review these military 
ballots so our servicemen and women aren't disenfranchised.

~ Given the remarks made about counting military ballots by Senator 
Lieberman, Florida's Democratic Senator Bob Graham, and Florida's Democratic 
Attorney General (and chairman of Gore's Florida campaign) Bob Butterworth, 
we can't imagine the Gore campaign will once again oppose the voting rights 
of our servicemen and women.

The Greenwood Position
Now we must fight for our country
BY PEGGY NOONAN
Friday, November 24, 2000

"We must fight. And we all know it. And it's fine.

"We like to complain, those of us of a certain age, that history has never 
given us the gaudy challenges it gave our parents and grandparents. But we've 
had our traumas, and from the time we were children: assassinations, riots, 
Vietnam, Watergate, the ayatollah, a stuck economy, the fall of the wall. 
We've had our moments.

"And now we face a great trial.

"And we're up to it.

"So let's go."

Washington Post
Gore Can't Heal the Hurt
By Richard Cohen
Friday, November 24, 2000

"I voted for Al Gore. I did so because I have known him since he was a 
congressman from Tennessee. I admire his intellect, his seriousness of 
purpose, his capacity for hard work and study, his political values, his 
experience and his knowledge. That being said, I now think that
under current circumstances he would not be the right man for the presidency. 
If I could, I would withdraw my vote. In the terminology of the moment, put 
me down as a hanging chad.

"I still think precisely as I have about Gore. But those 'current 
circumstances' I just mentioned change everything. Given the present 
bitterness, given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps, 
the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator, a likable guy
who will make things better and not worse. That man is not Al Gore. That man 
is George W. Bush.

"Bush has incessantly proclaimed himself as that sort of guy--'a uniter, not 
a divider.' The tendency is to dismiss that sort of chest-thumping as 
campaign nonsense, but in Bush's case it appears to be true. After all, the 
Bush boomlet began among his fellow Republican governors, each of whom 
probably thought the next president should be
none other than himself.

"So it says something about Bush that the governors were able to coalesce 
around him. Some of these governors knew Bush quite well, some hardly at all, 
but the fact remains that they all seemed to genuinely like the guy and 
respected his leadership abilities.

"You hear the same sort of thing from people who worked with Bush in private 
enterprise. I talked with one of them once, a Democrat who disagreed with 
Bush on many issues. Yet he, too, praised Bush's leadership abilities, his 
talent for bringing order out of chaos and for reaching some sort of 
consensus. That man's testimony impressed
me. His disagreements with Bush were real, his admiration for him profound.

"Gore, on the other hand, has little of those abilities. His own party is 
sore at him for taking the one-two punch of peace and prosperity and running 
a race that is still not concluded. His performance was as erratic as his 
uniform-of-the-day: earth tones on Tuesday, business suit on Wednesday. The 
country sensed that either he did not know
himself, or what he did know the country would not like."

Wall Street Journal
How Democrats Wage Political War
-Controlling the government is imperative to the party's survival.
BY CLETA MITCHELL
Monday, November 20, 2000

"In case you're bewildered by the machinations of the Gore
campaign-turned-law-firm, let there be no doubt that the goings on in Florida 
are perfectly in keeping with the way Democrats normally think and behave. 
Lawsuits are a key part of the Democrats' political strategy, so nothing 
about Florida should surprise anyone who has spent time in the Democratic 
Party.

"Until 1995, I was a Democrat. I've been a Democrat elected official, a party 
official and an active party member, so I know how Democrats think.

"Democrats know and internalize, understand and are motivated by, certain 
ideas, concepts and principles that seem to be foreign to Republicans. And 
Democrats are elated that Republicans don't know or function under the same 
ideas. These basic rules of Democratic thinking are at work in Florida. This 
primer should help explain what makes the Democrats tick.

"Rule 1: If we don't win, we don't eat.

"Rule 2: State courts are 'home' to Democrats.

"Rule 3, the 'golden rule': He who makes the rules wins the gold."

Exit Polling Says At Least 1.5% Of Americans Did Not Vote In
Presidential Contest

While the Gore campaign says dimpled ballots must be counted because every 
voter obviously intended to vote in the Presidential contest, FOX NEWS 
reports that at least 1.5% of voters told exit pollsters on November 7 that 
they did not vote in the presidential race. Experts say this understates the 
actual percentage of people who voted in down ballot races, but NOT in the 
presidential contest.

The number of "undervoters" in the three Florida recount counties the Gore 
campaign is trying to mine for additional votes is roughly 1.5-2.25%, well 
within the range suggested by the exit polls.

Conclusion: These instructions show that the voter was given advice to avoid 
dimple and hanging chads.

Subject: Request for Ken to contact Chancellor Reed, California State 
University System

Rosalee,

I have left Ken a voicemail request but thought I would follow up with a note 
to you that might help clarify the request.

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit 
Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity 
service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE 
service.  The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 
90 days from now.  
We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit 
Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to 
attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  
We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior 
executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  
Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we 
would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  
This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus 
splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the 
appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as 
long as the setttlement discussions progress.  
A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to 
have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one 
business lead (in this case, this could be me).  I am not sure that Ken's 
schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.  If timing is bad 
for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative.    

I will follow up with a phone call to you.  Hope this helps.

David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the 
policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't 
think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so 
the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to 
come. Rick

I would like to make the temperary VAR permanent.  I would give most to gas 
and some to power.  I feel like its the best place in the company for it.

Please let me know.

Hi John,

I assume you spoke with Nigel following your voicemail on Friday and he has 
brought you up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make fix this problem, and we are trying to 
ensure everyone is in the loop.

The problem looks to be a software bug somewhere in the Cisco operating 
environment. This has been escalated to Cicso's highest priority and we have 
had up to 6 Cisco engineers working on the problem. We have also flown in one 
on the Houston Netwrok team to assist. The problem we have is that the two 
core 6500 routers, which are at the hub of the network will run along 
perfectly at about 7% utilization, then, for an as yet undetermined reason 
they suddenly jump to 99% and start thrashing, dropping network connectivity. 

The catch 22 we have is that when the system goes down, the Cicso guys need 
time to capture diagnostic information, but of course we just need to get it 
up again straight away.

The team have systematically gone though each hardware component and each 
software component to ensure all are working, all are at the latest cisco 
recomended release level and all are required. Those not needed are removed 
to ensure the 'simplest' environment possible.

The bottom line is that we still haven't solved the problem, but are doing 
everything in our power to resolve it ASAP.

Regards
MRP

fyi, we have been working on a network redesign since before these problems 
start which will distribute the network across more Core routers, (in effect 
seperate networks). This design is the same as that proposed for the new 
Houston building. Whatever design is in place, however, we can never rule out 
a problem due to faulty software such as this.

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch.  
Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen 
from here.  Even if the front stays relatively unchanged.

Wendy Gramm invited Jeff Skilling to attend a social event for Senator Lugar 
(R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, 
so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf?  
I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies.   
Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary 
jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a 
senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy 
debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign 
relations issues, and is pro-trade.

Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I 
will get additional details to you asap.

Thank you.

Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but 
rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals 
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with 
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work 
that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron 
deal.

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

At Enron, we=01,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing=
=20
products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers =
=01)=20
the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot bett=
er=20
is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w=
e=20
need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=
=20
sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr=
oved and=20
recommended the following:

? Professional Services =01) This is our largest area of discretionary spen=
ding,=20
at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes=
 our=20
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other=20
consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and=
=20
terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring al=
l=20
future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be=20
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),=
=20
effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be=20
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and=20
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=
=20
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July =
1,=20
all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe=
r=20
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable. =
=20
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=
nt=20
and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easie=
r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=
=20
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=
=20
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=
=20
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=
e=20
Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location -=
=20
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by=
=20
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking=20
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same=20
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book=
=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20
http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outsi=
de=20
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=
h=20
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=
=20
preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each=20
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further=
=20
elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron=
=20
retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensib=
le=20
actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look fo=
r=20
cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If=
=20
you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please=20
e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions=
=20
and answers about these policies is posted on=20
http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional=20
questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on=20
Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving=20
recommendations.

Let's discuss - there were quite a few changes to be done first.  

The first place to demo will be the Thursday lunch meeting to the Net Works 
team when ready.

Confirm Central 1.0
Contract Exchange 1.0

Please let us know if you are interested in attending.

All the best,

Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases 
he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed 
program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris 
called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that 
the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 
'pro-Enron'!

Best!

--Christie.

Greg - here is Randy's resume. He is the guy I was telling you about on 
Friday as we were walking out of the building. I think he could make Enron a 
lot of money.

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

National Association For Acquiring Wealthy Spouses Revises Internet
Executive Ratings

(Chicago, IL) In an emergency summit, preceding their annual convention,
the National Association For Acquiring Wealthy Spouses (NAFAWS) revised
their ratings for eligible singles in the profession of Internet
executive.

"It was very trendy, two years ago, to marry an Internet executive,"
Mindi Newman, NAFAWS president-elect told reports.  "The salaries were
huge, the stock options plentiful, and the little dears were always at
the office, so you had your time to yourself."

It seems the dot-bomb phenomenon has tempered long-term expectations on
the worth of Internet executives as marital partners.  The stock market
plunge has sent net-worth's plummeting overnight and liquid assets have
been eaten up during periods of unemployment, causing some NAFAWS
members to set their sights on mates in more traditional lines of work,
like petroleum executive, physician and trust fund recipient.

"The problem with Internet executives isn't so much the salary as the
volatility of assets," Newman explained.  "Given the high divorce rate
amongst our members, a rapidly fluctuating net worth, commonly caused by
assets like stock options suffering through bear and bull markets, can
make timing the market for a divorce problematic.  If you finalize your
settlement when the stock is at a temporary peak and it bottoms out
before you can cash out, what was the point of the marriage?

"Similarly, the culture of vesting schedules amongst Internet executives
has influenced their pre-nuptial agreements.  In some severe cases,
Internet executives are limiting the assets available in case of divorce
on a sliding scale determined by the length of the marriage.
Ironically, prior to the proliferation of stock options that made these
Internet works so attractive as partners, a vesting schedule was unheard
of in matrimonial matters.  Now it limits their appeal."

NAFAWS has officially downgraded the rating of Internet executives to
Hold from Accumulate Dates.

"While the lack of meaningful stock options is a minus, these executives
are still drawing decent salaries, in many cases," Newman elaborated.
"As there is always a chance the market will rebound and their earnings
potential will rise.  As such, we have lowered them to a Hold rating,
instead of a Dump rating.  We do have the caveat that male NAFAWS
members should continue to Accumulate Dates with female Internet
Executives, as there are relatively few of them and their availability
should dry up quickly in the case of a market upswing."

BRAIN DEAD
In the words of Shaggy
By The Big Head

While I don't normally like to do local stories, I felt some recent
activities warranted such action.

Recently the state of Illinois announced they were voting to cut the
funding for technology by about $20MM.  I found this incredulous, until
I started to think about the way things really work here in our lovely
state.

What I have come to realize is that no one really accepts
responsibility. It is all about protecting personal and political turf.
While most of our leaders talk a good game, in reality very little gets
done.

Why is that I began to ponder?  Is it lack of vision?  Fortitude?
Support? Funding? Belief? Testicals?  What exactly could it be?

Last time I checked, technology was the fastest growing industry and
sector.  It had the highest paying jobs and the potential for the most
substantial increase in the tax revenue.

Why then would the state vote to cut the funding?  Additionally, why did
the coalition, wait until a single week before the vote to attempt to
rally the troops?  How much of a difference could we really make in just
under a week?

While we don't yet know the outcome of the vote, it begat a train of
thought.  This led me to question all sorts of issues, many of which
remain unresolved and a few of which I am throwing in just for the hell
of it.

While it is often quoted, "the story you are about to hear is real, the
names have been changed to protect the innocent", none of that such
shannangry (that is a president Bush word if you were unsure) will occur
here.  No, we are not protecting the names of the innocent, because in
our opinion, most of them are not innocent.

If you are reading this outside of Chicago, feel free to drop the names
in of your own local leaders; I'm sure it will be as relevant.

Last, the following has the most dramatic impact if you have ever heard
the song by the quasi rap/reggae artist Shaggy.  He has a great song
titled, "it wasn't me".  The premise is, whenever someone accuses you of
doing something, or expected you to do something, your patented response
is....."It wasn't me".

With that, let's play our little song:  After each question, follow it
with the answer; "It Wasn't Me!"  (Shortened after each question to
"IWM" to save me from typing)

Shaye Mandle; I thought you were supposed to have more pull than this?
IWM

Governor Ryan; I thought you were supposed to fight harder for your
technology initiatives? IWM

Illinois Coalition; I thought you were supposed to do more than 3 panels
a quarter? IWM

IDFA: I thought you were supposed to give out all of you 16 million or
so over 3 years? IWM

DECCA: I thought after your Boeing win, you would be able to save the
technology budget?  IWM

Katherine Gehl: I hoped you would have an initiative that would make an
impact on Chicago and would have stuck by your guns with the McKinsey
report? IWM

Flip Filipowski: I though you were an incubator company who would
protect and nurture your investment companies? IWM

David Weinstein: I thought you would have sense not to spend $30 Million
in 8 months? IWM

Bill Lederer: I thought you would more closely watch your money,
especially when $23 Million was being spent with no customer
acquisition? IWM

Mayor Daley: I thought you had more clout than to let flip pull out of
the Skyscraper fund and the local investment community to consistently
fool you into thinking they were supporting the local technology
community? IWM

A local VC: an early stage investment? IWM

Jim Downing (IVCA); an attempt to address what McKinsey points out is a
detriment to Chicago in the lack of early stage investing? IWM

Skyscraper fund; I thought you were supposed to invest in Chicago
companies, last I checked Schaumburg companies don't pay Chicago taxes?
IWM

Michael Gray; I thought you were supposed to invest the money into local
startups? IWM

Local Entrepreneurs: I thought you were supposed to learn how to read a
balance sheet, wisely spend money, and know what the sales cycle is for
your product? IWM

The universities; I thought you were supposed to develop a good
technology transfer program so students could and would be encouraged to
start businesses and remain in Illinois? IWM

First Tuesday and Big Frontier: I thought you would realize that
eventually, if none of the companies have any money to buy the services,
eventually the sponsors will get smart, figure that out and quite
sponsoring? IWM

Ron May: I thought you would figure out that if all you do is report
negativity and lay offs, ultimately there will be no companies left to
report anything on at all? IWM

Prairie Angels: I thought if you are an Angel group you were supposed to
actually make an investment? IWM

Pate Phillips: I thought you were above holding a grudge for not being
included in the Boeing deal? IWM

Prairie Fire: I thought you were going to pick the top 10 companies who
had the best chance of getting funded....and then actually help them?
IWM

TIE: I thought you would announce the rules of participation BEFORE an
event when it came to the opportunity to present to the Prairie Angels?
IWM

John Stroiber of Fast Record: I really hoped you could hold out longer?
IWM

The recent company requesting info on ProofSpace: Where were you a year
ago when they actually needed a client? IWM

Anyone who could have invested in PayPal; I hoped one of our local
Investors would have recognized a good technology before they left for
the west coast and raised $175 Million in Funding? IWM

And the beat goes on.  So, there you have it, next time you hear someone
say something that you know isn't true, or doesn't make any sense,
realize what there answer will be; "It wasn't me!"

New Tissues Headlines for Week of 5-29

5-28-2001 (Chicago)  e. e. Cummings Risen From Grave and Naming
Dot.Com's
Researchers at the University of Chicago's Venkman School of
Parapsychology have detected paranormal activity surrounding local
Internet firms.  "i-Street, ePrairie, iExplore, eFiltration, iGive,
marchFIRST, divine interVentures... it's obvious," said Professor Randi
of the Venkman School.  "The punctuation style is clearly the work of
the ghost of e.e. Cummings, with his famous capitalization quirks,
exerting influence over unwitting executives trying to name their
companies."
Professor Randi first became aware of the ghost, when marchFIRST
contacted her in search of an explanation for their company's name.
Unfortunately, early attempts at exorcisms have only resulted in the
firm going out of business, but Professor Randi assures the CBT that the
Venkman School, funded by executives looking for a convenient excuse,
will endeavor to find a less fatal way to remove the Cummings influence
from the tech scene.

5-28-2001  (Chicago).  Skyscraper Fund is Reconstituted, Selects First
Three Deals.
After falling on hard times this winter when Divine, Inc. withdrew its
financial support, the Skyscraper Fund could not follow through on its
mandate to Fund Chicago start-ups.  However all is well with since the
City was able to find $12-$15 in supporting revenues. As a result, the
Fund announced it's first three investments: BlueMeteor.com,
BeautyJungle.com and Eppraisals.com.
"We called over to each to let them know we have selected them, but they
haven't returned our calls," said Skyscraper bigwig Jim Tyree. "I'm sure
they'll get back to us soon. They have such sterling business plans,
they're probably just too busy to telephone."

5-29-2001 (Springfield) Heavy Lobbying from Illinois Coalition Results
in Restoration of Tech in State Budget.
In a strange reversal, State funds were restored to the budget at the
last minute.  "Wow, that was close," said Shaye Mandel, the State's key
tech czar.  Fifteen minutes before presentation to the legislature, the
funds mysteriously appeared. All lobbying by Chicago's high-tech
community late last week seemed to go nowhere, leaving it unlikely that
state lawmakers would restore $21.3 million in technology.
But Mandel took another tact, which seemed to work.  "I contacted the
low-tech community, principally Vito Boomba, (aka "Vinny da Violinist")
and he said he's have 'a conversation wit Pate'," Shaye said. Word is
Vito said, "Eh, dat Pate guy came tru and since he went wit the money
showin up in da budget, he looks better dan he wood if he was part of da
new runways at Midway." Word on the street is that Vito "invested" in
Fermi Lab: "'Cause you gotta take care of dem piasans." No one
volunteered to tell Vito that Fermi's been dead for 40 years.

5-29-2001  (Evanston)  Brain Drain from Chicago's Business Schools
Slows.
The latest statistics show fewer members of the graduating classes at
Northwestern's Kellogg Graduate School of Management and the University
of Chicago's Graduate School of Business are heading west than in recent
years. "They seem to be heading for the beach," a Kellogg staffer was
cited as saying.  "Of course, when summer's over, they might be heading
to these locations in California they put on their forwarding
addresses." She continued.
An informal poll of business school graduates taken by the CBT indicated
that when asked if Chicago would be considered as a job location;
giggles and outfight guffaws immediately followed. In one case, this
reporter was asked which drug was I using, because "that would be
excellent, dude - especially if I stay in Chicago."

5-30-2001 (Oak Brook) McDonald's Adopts Payment Technology - and Gets
Gas in the Process.
 In its ongoing quest to cut service times for fast food, McDonald's
Corp. Monday said it's employing high-tech electronic payment systems to
speed the fast food gas payment process. "We can't get the food to you
quicker, but we can take your money faster," a company spokesperson was
quoted as saying. By using a payment device designed by Exxon Mobil
Corp. for use at its Mobil gas stations, McDonald's expects to let the
system charge your gastric discomfort to your favorite credit card.
"The idea came to us when we realized a significant by-product of our
food was gas. So why not charge for it just like Mobil does?" When
explained that the gas they were talking about was different than what
Mobil dispensed, the spokesperson seemed disappointed. "Huh? Well, I
guess we could just use it to pay for the food, I suppose," Was the
retort.

5-31-2001 (Chicago)  Survey Debunks Theory of Lack of Venture Investment
Money in Chicago.
The Illinois Venture Capital Association released its latest survey on
the state of venture Capital Money in Chicago.  "Our statistics show
that there is a 20% gain in investment capital in this City," cited IVCA
Executive Director Jim Downing. "Just because we haven't invested in
anything here doesn't mean there isn't any money available."
When queried about local investments in the near future, Downing
indicated that IVCA's first priority was to fund a high-tech PR firm
that could tout the " . . . absolute tons of investments we might make
in the upcoming year. After all, you just saw how we promoted pro-growth
legislative initiatives in Illinois with our assistance on the State
budget."

5-31-2001 (Chicago)  Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA)
Announces $470,000 in Investments - A Host of Firms to Follow in the
Next 6 Months.
The Illinois Development Finance Authority announced investments in
three companies.  "Now all we have to do is make 120 more investments in
the next six months and we've reached our goal," Nora Blizfig said.  "If
we review 5 business plans a week and put together 100 panels, we'll
have no trouble giving out the $20 million we're chartered to
release."
When queried by CBT staff as to why only 3 companies received funds
since January, Ms. Blizfig recounted, "Well, er, we got a slow start,
but we're really humming now."  Asked if she could name any companies
under consideration, she cited Blue Meteor and Eppraisals.com. As the
first step in the process, companies seeking funds were invited to send
their business plans to State Senator Pate Phillips.

SHOCK THERAPY
Selecting "Men In Black and Blue"

By I.P. Daley
Editor In Chief

Todd Allen, our "resident and chief Smart-Ass" approached me during one
of my lucent moments last week, griping that we have a Women in Black
program in town but no Men in Black.  For those of you who have been
locked away even further and longer than yours truly, Women in Black is
program that annually celebrates the achievement of women in the tech
community.

Todd was upset that we don't do the same for those of the other gender,
but I had to take the politically correct posture, as I was seated at
the time, and inform him that men don't need to be recognized for their
contribution to tech as women do, because we already get plenty of
notoriety.

This did not seem to mollify Todd, but as we debated (as I drifted in
and out), it occurred to me that I was partially right, but not
completely so - and in a flash of brilliance, it struck me (or was that
my nurse?): WE DO NEED TO CELEBRATE MEN IN CHICAGO TECH - BUT WHAT WE
NEED TO CELEBRATE IS MASCULINE FAILURE!

Think of it; 20 men selected each year, or whenever we get around to it,
for their contribution to the Chicago Tech Wreck!  And as such black is
appropriate - you know - as in mourning. Well, after Todd stopped
laughing, we sat down with The Big Head and started throwing some
suggestions out:

David Wienstein, for his ability to spend more money faster than a drunk
at the dice tables in Las Vegas (and he didn't even get lucky, so I
hear).
Bob Bernard, for his excellent management of March (or is it April)
First.
Bill Lederer, for his great foresight in investing in a wonderful string
of successful e-companies.
Andrew, "Flip" Filipowski, for reinventing divine interVentures into a
"software company" at the expense of their 40 incubated (more like
roasted) start-ups.
Ron May, for ensuring that no self-respecting investor would show up in
a town with so, so many failures.
Mohan Sawhney, for his perfect batting average on Internet business
predictions.
Bill Schermer, for focusing and spending more money on marketing than on
actual sales creation.


But we picked the easy ones, now you get to rack your brains, scratch
your ____ and fill out the field.  Send your picks to me
IPDaley@thechicagobraintrust.com and we'll publish them. Please, in the
interest of our audience's average age of 11 and their sensitivity, keep
you language to only the highest level when describing your selection's
reason for nomination. And don't come up with any women either, we had a
few in mind, but this is "Men in Black and Blue", not "Dufuses in Black
and Blue".

After a week or so or when you people run out of ink, our e-mail server
crashes from overload, or we get served with a lawsuit by the feminist
community, Todd, the Head and your Editor will put our heads, or other
parts of our anatomy, together and pick the best twenty.

The Prize, you ask?  Give us some time and we'll come up with something,
but you may suggest that as well.

Until next week or when they release me,

I.P.

Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  The strategy of Enron 
Principal Investments will be to work with the all the business units across 
Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, which leverage the 
unique and proprietary knowledge of Enron.   These investments may be in the 
form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and distressed 
debt positions. 

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Michael Miller and Gene Humphrey will both join 
Enron Principal Investments as senior investment professionals in the group.  
Additionally, many other legacy investment positions existing in Enron will 
be transferred to Enron Principal Investments.  Richard Lydecker will 
continue to manage these legacy investments.  

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Michael, Gene, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the 
attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  
In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of 
the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management 
(Lemmons):

? Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is 
where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure 
consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final 
PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the 
names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
? The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of 
representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions 
were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure 
fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC 
Committee.  
? An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion 
criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by 
mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the 
memo distribution list that evening.

Regards,
Billy

From: Don Evans, Chairman, Bush-Cheney Campaign

This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George W. Bush and 
Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation in Florida.

It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount effort in Florida.  
Governor Bush won the vote on Election Day, a victory confirmed by a 
recount.  Now, the other side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is 
a reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

The expense of the recount effort must be funded immediately.  Please send a 
check in any amount that you can up to $5000 today.  These contributions, in  
keeping with Governor Bush's "full disclosure" policy on financial 
contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.  Any funds not 
spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

Remember:
1.  Checks must be personal, not corporate.
2.  Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
3.  Mail or overnight check to:

Donald L. Evans
301 Congress Avenue
2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
Austin, Texas 78701

4.  These funds do not count against your annual personal federal giving 
limit of $25,000.

Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have friends that can 
help, please forward this message to them immediately.  We thank you for all 
that you did to help elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank 
you in advance for your willingness to help us during this important time in 
the life of our country.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=

Team members are:=20

Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=

=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=

temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=

phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=

I recently sent to you an e-mail outlining our current status with 
EnronOnline and asking you to call i2 to gauge their interest in the 
software.  

As per Greg Brady's e-mail below, it appears that call may be unnecessary.

Thanks.

Based on market conditions, and others issues we are dealing with
internally at i2, we are not interested in evaluating this opportunity any
longer.

Let's stay in touch as things change.

Greg - 

Clarification and follow up to our discussion.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.


Thank you - Dan

From: Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/16/2001 07:58 AM

Subject: UC/CSU Procedural Next Steps

As you know, UC/CSU sued us for breach of contract in March.  At the same 
time they moved for a preliminary injunction to restore them to direct access 
during the pendency of the case.  The district court granted their motion and 
issued the preliminary injunction.  We appealed the granting of a preliminary 
injunction in these circumstances, and, in addition, asked the Court of 
Appeals to stay the effect of the district court's order until our appeal 
could be heard.

The Court of Appeals granted our request for a stay.  Because of the 
similarity beween the legal tests for granting a stay and for granting of 
preliminary injunction, to grant the stay the Court of Appeals necessarily 
had to find, at least preliminarily, that the district court likely erred in 
granting the preliminary injunction.  This is why we think we will win our 
appeal, especially if it is heard by the same panel.  (Whether or not it is 
heard by the same panel depends on the clerk of the Court of Appeals and the 
schedules of the judges.)

We filed our brief in support of our appeal on May 14.  UC/CSU's and the AG's 
answering briefs must be filed by June 11.  Our reply brief is due 14 days 
after their briefs are filed.  The appeal is then referred to a 3-judge 
panel.  Oral argument is usually allowed.

If we win the appeal, UC/CSU campuses in PG&E and SCE territory remain on 
utililty service until a final decision is made in the case.   If we lose the 
appeal, we have to take them back until a final decision in made in the 
case.  The appeal relates only to the preliminary injunction.  The breach of 
contract action remains to be tried at the district court level.  

The contract expires March 31, 2002.  In the ordinary course a final decision 
in the case would not be made by then.  The judge, however, could expedite 
the proceedings so that a decision could be made earlier.  UC/CSU could also 
move for summary judgment, arguing that that facts are not in dispute and 
that the judge should rule without a trial.  In either event, it would seem 
unlikely that a final decision even on a expedited basis could be handed down 
before late fall/winter.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks.

Summary:

* Britain's Crown Estate (hereditary possessions of the Royal family)
has granted seventeen UK companies the option to build wind power generation
projects with a potential value of U$2.3 billion on their land.  Wind
turbine sites have been approved for several regions ranging from Scotland
to the south coast of England, however government and regulatory approval
remains necessary for the projects to go ahead.
* BP, together with the government of Spain and the Phillipines, plan
to build a $48 million solar power plant that will deliver electricity to
over 150 villages (400,000 residents) that are isolated in the Phillipines.
The system will be installed in two separate installments, the first of
which is planned for September.

Subject: EnronOnline Opportunity with i2


As background for Mr. Lay's call to Sanjiv Sidhu of i2 concerning the 
EnronOnline opportunity, here is a brief summary of where we stand and our 
suggestions:

History of Enron/i2 Discussions

? i2 was one the initial companies contacted by Enron Net Works (ENW) for the 
EnronOnline commercial discussion.
? The focus of the Enron/i2 discussion earlier this year was a complete sale 
of the software asset that drives EnronOnline to i2.
? i2 expressed considerable interest in the opportunity below the executive 
level, but ENW had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2.
? In order to get the discussion started, ENW provided an offer to i2.
? i2's response to the Enron offer was that they considered it high and that 
they would prefer to partner with Enron in some manner in addition to some 
form of purchase.
? ENW expressed interest in talking with i2 about this and requested that 
they outline their preferred deal to Enron.
? ENW never received a term sheet or other information on a new price and 
partnering concept from i2.

Current Status of EnronOnline Commercial Initiative

? Since those early discussions with i2, ENW has discussed the EnronOnline 
opportunity with other selected technology companies, and is now considering 
bids from several potential counterparties.  
? Generally speaking the deal structure that appears to provide the best 
opportunity for both parties entails involvement by ENW after the 
transaction, in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both, 
as well as the transfer of some Enron people.  
? This seems to move us into the realm of a "partnership" structure that 
could fit the initial i2 interest.

Current Enron/i2 Status

? Rex Shelby talked briefly with Greg Brady, i2 CEO, at a conference in NYC 
two weeks ago.  
? Greg Brady expressed interest in renewing talks around the EnronOnline 
opportunity.  

Current Status of the Sale Opportunity

? We are now reaching the point in the process at which we need to determine 
whether there is an interest from i2.
? We want to make sure we give i2 the opportunity to outline a proposal with 
a price as well as outline their needs for a relationship going forward, or 
to confirm that they are not interested.

Suggested Message to Sanjiv Sidhu

Our suggested message to Sanjiv is:
.
1. Enron remains interested in exploring this opportunity with i2 if there is 
a genuine interest from i2.
2.   Enron is open to considering deal structures that provide incentive for 
participation by Enron after the transaction.
3.   Enron is moving down the path with other parties, so if i2 has an 
interest, we would need to start working with them soon.

Thank you for your assistance on this.  Please let us know if you need more 
information.

Liz and Greg,
 Now that I've healed from the experience, I wanted to thank both of you for 
your generous donations put towards the sponsorship of my MS-150 
Houston-Austin bicycle ride.  It was much appreciated, and the money all goes 
to a good and worthy cause.  (Contrary to my initial gut impulse, the money 
did not go to the "Scott Tholan New Bike Fund").  
 Seriously though, thanks for your support.  I recently sent in your checks, 
and they should be deposited by the MS organization in the next several days. 

--Scott

Steve,

Thank you for the diagram and sorry for not getting back to you sooner.
We are evaluating how Merchants Exchange and Enron could work together
and will contact you when we are ready to move the dialogue forward.

Thanks,

Greg,
 I am meeting with Michael Walker of "TransModel" to discuss their concept.  
In case you wanted to stop by, MIke and players to be named later from 
TransModel will come here (my office) on 1 PM next Thurs (May 31).  
 Mike seems like a good guy and obviously is quite familiar with Enron.  He 
asked about my title and position ("Director, Competitive Analysis").  Maybe 
I'm too sensitive, but MIke may have been a little disappointed, but I 
assured him that I was with the "Office of the Chair" and that this potential 
project fell nicely into my area of responsibility.  I further hinted that I 
dealt with "information" in the company.  
 Anyway, looking forward to hearing how they may help or fit into to our 
overall plan.  Happy to have good help from these guys if we can get it.

-Scott

John,
     I had lunch today with David Ownby (plus, Brent Larsen and Michael Chang 
of RedMeteor.com).   David suggested that perhaps there could be some sort of 
arrangement between RedMeteor.com and EOL wherein each could benefit from the 
other's platform.  He was referring specifically to the refined products and 
crude oil areas (where they are primarily physical and we are primarily 
financial).  I am under the impression that there may have been some contact 
earlier this year between Enron management and Vincent Di Cosimo of RedMeteor 
and I had heard the names of Greg Whalley and John Sherriff mentioned in that 
regard.  Is that correct and did anything ever materialize?
     As you know RedMeteor and Vitol are in the process of formalizing a 
strategic alliance to "aid in their positioning in the global marketplace" as 
reported in the media.  And the person involved from Vitol, Mike Loya, is a 
person that I have known for years, but have not discussed this topic with 
him.  Is there anything worth pursuing with RedMeteor?
Regards,
Mike

Ca energy issues are out of control. Consumer groups are screaming about 
gouging. I will email today's articles from the Chronicle. The market has 
gone down more today with MSFT info after hours. Will keep being choppy. Glad 
no further rearrangements at ENE. You mentioned Bonds the other day, do you  
want some tax free muni ideas. If so how far out would you be comfortable 
with? I will talk to my Dallas muni desk for suggestions. How big was that 
check I was watching for? Ben

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me
my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the
COO position.

Greg, 

You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing 
Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other 
people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed 
shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am 
once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the 
appropriate individuals at Enron.

Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the 
past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to 
help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce 
Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing 
Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest 
to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such 
as: 

- Event Management 
- Marcom 
- Marketing Financial Management 
- Strategic Planning 
- Direct Marketing 
- Web Response 
- Lead Management 

Leading Analysts have identified Aprimo as the clear leader in Enterprise 
Marketing Management. I would like to arrange brief discovery meetings with 
some of the individuals responsible for Marketing's contribution to Enron's 
growth.

I would appreciate any direction that you and Liz can provide.

   Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based
     Employee Referral Program.

     This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs.
     Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of
     quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals
     stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through
     other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee
     referral program with less work and better results.

     There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is
     hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

     So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and
     help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

     Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us
     know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application
     should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that
     would enhance the program, send us an e-mail
     (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713)
     345-3254, option 2.

The following editorial was published on the Assembly Republican website 
today and probably offers a good preview of the 130pmPST press conference.

For those of you concerned with tracking generator stocks or following the 
Edison bankruptcy outlook, consider the following quote:
"Rather than make Edison and the power generating companies completely whole 
while the government takes over ownership of the "grid", lets instead make a 
clean deal. One can be fashioned that requires Edison and the power 
generators to take some write-offs so that the ratepayers do not bear the 
entire burden and the transmission lines remain in private hands."

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or 
Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high 
stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to 
those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member 
of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our 
offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have 
effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have 
the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, 
when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful 
assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our 
efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have 
any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact 
Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Hi Greg,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. As I mentioned I have a
BS/MS in EE from MIT and experience at JP Morgan in both equity
 and credit derivatives. I am currently a second year at Stanford Business
School and am interested in exploring opportunities at Enron in new
and innovative products in risk management. I have both a love for
understanding risk and am very entreprenurial by nature and like to create
new opportunities. Attached is a copy of my resume.

Thank you

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's 
Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no 
later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) 
inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept 
the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our 
shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And 
assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason 
for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, 
if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business 
on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

Power Board's Industry Ties May Be Cut/Federal regulators consider making 
deregulation's creation independent
Susan Sward, David Lazarus


   As power prices skyrocket and California reels from the threat of
blackouts, the agency charged with overseeing the state's power grid has
come under increasing attack, and federal regulators are poised to order
sweeping changes in its governing board.
   Ever since the Legislature created the California Independent System
Operator four years ago, critics have lambasted the agency, saying it is
dominated by the power industry and does not have ratepayers' interests at
heart.
   Criticism of the ISO has grown as electricity reserves have dwindled and
as the agency has initiated statewide energy alerts that have required
hundreds of businesses to cut back their operations.
   "There are people on the ISO governing board who have a direct financial
interest in the policies they set," said Severin Borenstein, a professor
of business administration and public policy at the University of
California at Berkeley and the director of the University of California
Energy Institute.
   Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue a
ruling that would remake the ISO's 26-member board, which includes
representatives of three investor-owned utilities, four municipal
utilities and two power generators.
   From its high-tech headquarters in Folsom -- reminiscent of NASA's mission
control center -- the nonprofit ISO essentially acts as traffic cop for a
power system that serves three-quarters of the state.
   Responsible for assuring a stable source of electricity, the ISO has the
authority to initiate emergency alerts and, if need be, rolling blackouts
if supplies drop to near nothing. By law, the utilities and power
generators must comply with ISO directives.
   Last month, federal regulators proposed an order calling for the ISO board
to be replaced by seven independent members. The new board would be
selected by the current ISO before it was replaced.
   Striving to restore order to the state's turbulent electricity market, the
commission said an overhaul of the ISO's management would be an important
first step toward easing the burden on consumers. CREATURE OF DEREGULATION
   The ISO was created as part of the Legislature's deregulation of the
state's electricity market in 1996. The Legislature set up the ISO as a
"stakeholder board" with designated seats for participants in the energy
marketplace.
   The theory was that those involved in the industry would be best able to
guarantee reliable electricity for the Bay Area and the other ISO-served
areas in California.
   "It was designed to be as neutral as possible," said Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.
"If anything, it's turned out to be far too cozy with power generators."
   State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, said lawmakers were told that
the deregulation blueprint they adopted in 1996 was a better alternative
than more sweeping proposals being considered by the state Public
Utilities Commission.
   Lawmakers were reassured at the time that the deregulation plan, which was
intended to lower power prices by increasing competition, had the full
backing of utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co., power
generators and large users of electricity.
   "You have to remember that the political climate was different then," said
Bowen, the author of a pending measure replacing the existing ISO board
with one appointed by the governor and independent of the industry.
   "We had a Republican Assembly and a Republican governor (Pete Wilson) with
(his) appointees on the PUC with a free market point of view," Bowen said.
"The bargaining position of the ratepayers and consumer groups was not
strong." PRIVATE COMPANIES' LEVERAGE
   Doug Heller, assistant director of the Foundation for Consumer and
Taxpayer Rights, said the Legislature set up the ISO the way it did
because "it and the regulators were so transfixed with the idea of the
free market that they ignored the tremendous leverage they were handing
over to the private energy companies."
   He added, "Because the ISO has a mandate to keep the lights on and procure
power when the utilities are short, this energy industry-dominated board
has used its mandate as justification for gouging consumers."
   If the prices currently being paid for electricity are sustained over
time, Heller said ratepayers would have an average monthly bill of $620
and a small business paying a $1,000 monthly electricity tab could see its
bill jump to $10,000 based on current energy market prices.
   Federal regulators almost certainly will not let this happen. They are
expected to announce measures today intended to keep wholesale prices
stable and thus protect users from sharp increases in their power bills.
   The ISO is currently chaired by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of
the Independent Energy Producers Association, a trade association whose
members generate about 24,000 megawatts of power in California.
   The board's members include representatives from two power generators,
Dynegy Inc. and an affiliate of Florida Power and Light; the state's three
investor-owned utilities, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas and Electric; and four municipal utilities serving Los Angeles,
Sacramento, Silicon Valley and several Southern California communities.
   UC's Borenstein said the ISO board should be constituted along the lines
of New England's power agency where "you go out and find independent
experts in power, finance and economics. New England has had its ups and
downs, but I think there is a trust the New England board is acting in the
best interests of consumers." POWER PRICING GATEKEEPER
   Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco
and a member of the ISO board, said that although the composition of the
ISO board is only one element of the California energy crisis, the ISO "is
at the crux of the matter because it establishes and administers the state
market rules that determine how pricing gets done.
   "The ISO has been a law to itself -- with its attitude being: 'We keep the
lights on, we know what's going on and others should butt out,' " he said.
   If federal regulators order an overhaul of the ISO today, "that may just
be the beginning of the battle," Florio said. "If the changes they order
don't offer customers relief from the extremely high prices, TURN and
others will call for the state to buy the transmission system from the
utilities as a means of wrestling back control from FERC."
   For his part, the consumer network's Shames is proposing a merger of the
ISO and the California Power Exchange, which coordinates the wholesale
market, thereby creating a "superagency" with full powers of oversight and
enforcement.
   Yesterday, the idea of making the ISO board independent picked up some
utility support as well. PG&E, which serves millions of customers in
Northern and Central California, issued a statement that "to restore
public confidence, we agree with state and federal officials that the ISO
board needs to be independent."
   In any case, the ISO is not without its defenders. Barbara Barkovich, an
ISO board member who is a San Rafael consultant to large industrial
customers, said some of the criticism of the ISO has been unfair.
   "There are larger market forces at work here: Clearly, we have a tight
supply situation compared to demand -- which means there will always be
upward pressure on prices," Barkovich said. "We have had a situation where
prices out of state have recently been very high, meaning when anyone is
selling, they will go where prices are the highest." POWERFULLY NOBLE
CAUSE
   For its part, she said, the ISO "has seen its role as doing everything it
could to keep the lights on rather than have blackouts."
   Others say the ISO simply does not have sufficient enforcement powers to
make its orders stick in a volatile energy market.
   "The ISO is a flawed institution, but it is not responsible for the
shortages," said Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network.
   Such assertions do not halt the drive to reform the ISO's makeup.
   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Monterey, is the author of one of several bills
now pending in the Legislature that would give Gov. Gray Davis authority
to appoint both a new ISO and a revamped Power Exchange.
   But he cautioned that if an ISO restructuring is all that happens, "We
might as well do nothing. It is only one element of the solution." MORE
REFORMS NEEDED
   Keeley said that for California to work through its energy crisis, several
major reforms must be put in place, including energy conservation moves,
as the state's population climbs by as much as 600,000 a year.
   One area crying out for attention, Keeley said, "is the demand side of the
market. When California found itself in an energy crisis in the 1970s, it
took good action on solar, renewable sources of energy, pricing and tax
actions in the law and do on."
   But he said that many of those changes have been tossed out or whittled
away in the intervening decades.
   The Legislature also needs to look at the possibility of "the public
having some generation assets under its control -- for example, the
hydroelectric assets PG&E now has up for sale," Keeley said.
   "PG&E's assets on Northern California rivers is the largest group of
hydroelectric assets under one ownership in the state," he said. "Public
ownership of these hydroelectric assets is preferable to private ownership
because those assets in public ownership would mean lower rates for
consumers."
   Whatever course the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state
lawmakers take, the stakes are undeniably high.
   "If this conflict is allowed to continue," Bowen wrote FERC Chairman James
Hoecker last month, ". . . then we have failed our duty to Californians."

Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification 
obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member 
Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted 
purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 
million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially 
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were 
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the 
issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Henry  Van

Robert,

I have on Greg's calendar the dates of Jan. 10 - 12 for Bonus & LTI Reviews 
w/you.  You booked this w/me a couple of months ago.  This has probably 
changed and should be removed from Greg's calendar.  Please advise.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.  As 
I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to 
contact him next week.

Subject: Visit to Enron week of 3/19



Dear Mr.Fallon,
?
As we discussed, I think that several of your  corporate staff people will be 
interested in discussing our rapidly  
developing situation.?? Our President and I will be in Texas next  week, and 
I would like to firm up the visit with 
you on Thursday?morning.?  will contact your secretary to finalize the 
details on  Monday morning.

I am the Vice President of Research at Uhere  Corp in San Jose.? We are 
creating a comprehensive, regulated,  
clearinghouse-enabled web based futures exchange for a wide variety of B2B  
trading sites.? Our exchange will 
allow?Enronto  hedge and offset trading positions that?it?hastaken in power 
or bandwidth
and  could substantially increase?Enron'strading volume and liquidity.? We 
are looking for a trader/marketer  
like?Enron to partner with us in  the electricity and/or bandwidth markets.? 
The objective is to create 
a  new kind of financial entity for Risk Management.?? 
?
Currently, we are testing our trading  software.? We have a large, collocated 
IBM system here in San Jose.?  
Our regulatory attorneys are moving ahead rapidly with our CFTC application,  
and our clearinghouse is now 
coming into focus.? We expect to be able  to sell contracts within 8-10 
weeks. 
?
At this early stage, we are quite flexible in the  kinds of partnering 
arrangements that we will consider.??  
?
As I indicated to you, our Chairman is Mr. Bob  Greber formerly Chairman at 
the Pacific Exchange, and 
our regulatory  attorneys are Farella, Braun & Martel LLP. 
?
Would you be kind enough to inform others  with?Enron of?our visit ... others 
who might be interested  in?using our
situation  to  amplify Enron's?capabilities
?
Best regards,
?
Michael J. Cahill

Challenging your manhood would do me no good.  I hope you're not suggesting 
that you're going to walk on a bet.  If I owed you $2,320, what would you do?

Subject: The Enron Corporate Policy Committee Retreat

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.

Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the 
Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I 
see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I 
also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and 
not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH 
by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the 
first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience.  

Lets discuss.

Draft memo on the functional alignment of South America under the new 
organization.  Would like to send out to the South America organization 
tonight to give people partial information on work in progress.  Silence is 
bothering people a lot and the company is at risk of losing people.  
Definitive organization memo out in the coming days, after complete 
coordination with wholesale and retail in Houston.  Look at the first version 
of the memo.  Please reply with any comments asap.

Greg,

We were informed as of the Board meeting this week either you or Mark must 
sign all DASH's above $5 million. Early next week will be bringing you a DASH 
approved by RAC recommending selling our interest in the PEMEX EPC 63/64 
projects in the Gulf of Mexico to Horizon Offshore .  We believe this an 
extremely good deal for Enron.  In essence, it returns our equity and working 
capital funding for this project plus halts our risk and improves our project 
margin by $1.5 to $2 million. By the terms agreed, we will receive $25.6 
million in cash and a complete release and indemnity from liability. We have 
a performance bond which at minimum will be protected back-to-back by an 
identical bond from the same bonding source, but it is likely Horizon can 
assume our bond.

This is such a good deal you might wonder why Horizon would do it.   Since 
January we have been playing hardball with both Horizon and Pemex.  Horizon 
is public and their stock has been rising as a oil company service provider.  
This project is 35% of their volume.  We believe they cannot afford a wobble 
with Pemex due the potential impact on their share price. We see no upsides 
for us on these projects.

Prior to this collection EEOS year-to-date has  $102 million of net postive 
cash flow versus a 2001 plan of $83 million.  We now believe we will finish 
the year at $150 million positive.  A little bright spot from NEPCO and the 
EECC Collection Agency.

If you have questions,  I am here and Brian will be in Houston on Monday.


Keith Dodson

Gentlemen,

 At 4:30 pm today, we will be reviewing and requesting your approval to 
establish Softs trading on EOL.  Attached is a presentation prepared by 
Darren and Trena for your review.  (A hard copy will be delivered to your 
office this morning.)

 I'm not sure if additional approval is required beyond your authority.  But, 
please be aware that once we start building this business it will be somewhat 
difficult to quickly terminate.  Further, I'm not including this business or 
the Softs brokerage business in the March 31, 2001 "go or no-go" decision for 
building a general ag business.

Regards,

Gary

Citigroup And Oracle Strike Marketplace Deal -- COMPANIES TEAM TO OFFER 
INTEGRATED PAYMENT SERVICES ON BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS EXCHANGES 11/20/2000 

Citigroup is extending its reach as a provider of financial services to 
business-to-business marketplaces. The $82 billion company has struck a deal 
with Oracle to integrate its payment and financial-settlement services into 
the vendor's online marketplace platform, Oracle Exchange.

In addition, Citigroup will co-brand and market OracleExchange.com, Oracle's 
trading exchange for business supplies, to business clients and deploy 
Oracle's E-procurement applications internally to simplify its own purchasing.

Citigroup already offers its services, called CitiConnect, to rival 
marketplace companies i2 Technologies Inc. and Commerce One Inc. CitiConnect 
supports complex financial transactions, such as employee procurement-card 
purchases, electronic funds transfers, and cross-border payments, for 
businesses participating in exchanges, whether or not they're Citibank 
customers.

Other financial companies target-ing this market include Chase Manhattan Bank 
Corp. and First Union Corp., which have partnerships with online marketplace 
software provider Metiom Inc.; Wachovia Corp. has aligned with Clarus Corp.; 
and ABN Amro, Bank of America, and US Bank have payment-services deals with 
Ariba Inc.

"We see the role of banks in this space increasing as more commerce occurs 
online," says Ann Cairns, global E-solutions head at Citigroup's E-business 
unit. "The key thing that we bring in working with technology companies is an 
understanding and intellectual capital around security and privacy issues."

But Cairns says few transactions occur on exchanges today. Most are building 
their marketplaces, she says. It may be a while before integrated payment 
services gain traction. A recent survey by AMR Research revealed that 
companies participating in exchanges are still most interested in product and 
vendor search capabilities, order status and tracking, and integration with 
partners.

RetailExchange .com Inc., a business-to-business exchange for excess consumer 
goods, is working on integrated credit services with commercial finance firm 
CIT Group Inc. It plans to add shipping and payment services eventually, but 
says large companies already have departments with expertise in those areas. 
Says Ken Frieze, president and CEO of RetailExchange.com, "add-on transaction 
services have to be better and have a greater value proposition than what's 
available offline."

Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
 Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run=
=20
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North=20
America.

 So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a=
=20
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with =
a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower=01,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO =
is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the b=
est
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30=20
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene=20
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that presid=
ent
of BankAmerica=01,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and sm=
all=20
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
 Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
      Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in=
=20
detail:

 *  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is=
=20
the
heart of NewPower=01,s business plan?
 *  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
 *  How he=01,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a mi=
llion
by the end of 2001.
 *  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What=20
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
 *  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest=
=20
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated=
=20
retail
marketer in the US.
 *  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
 *  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
 *  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
 *  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
 *  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
 *  What=01,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
 *  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bi=
ll,
what kind of margin can it make now?
 *  How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We=01,re actually in a very good=
=20
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... "
 *  "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a=
=20
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in=
=20
the
industry by several orders of magnitude."

We=01,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading=
=20
company
in our industry is going to get there and stay there.

** Related to critical commercial issues. **

The ESA internet home page launch is ca. 4 weeks old and has met with 
reasonable success.  

The hits to the site continue to grow to several thousand per week; however, 
the issues outlined below referring to our need to establish appropriate 
commercial support to the site and proactively readying upgrades and next 
generations integrated to the commercial efforts have fallen short.

Subject: internet site - Enron South America

I wanted to forward some comments on the situation of the Enron South America 
internet site and :

Emphasize the need to accelerate and integrate the understanding of the 
leverage of the e-platform to the commercial business, including the need to 
change the present priorities and responsibility of the commercial groups in 
the region towards aggressively supporting and promoting the internet tool 
and 
Offer some comment on lessons learned implementing version 1 and 
recommendations for more effectively executing a version 2
Comments:
1.    The support functions ( e-mail generated and internal allocation for 
prompt responses to customer inquiry, text and content upgrades and editing, 
etc.,..)  is  THE critical issue to realising the functional goal (efficient 
customer capture ) of the site.     To my knowledge, the issue outlined in 
the e-mail below (the  most recent of several urging action and some 
decision-making) remains unaddressed, this almost 1 month following the 
launch of the site.    From my  perspective and commercial experience, the 
present situation which has inquiries being directed directly into a generic 
e-mail system with part-time  support from the orginal PR staff is not 
acceptable, nor advisable - as was extensively discussed in the weeks prior 
to launch.   

 Though I understand that the commercial structure and strategy is in flux, 
the clear indecision and lack of ownership reflects a lack of vision and   
understanding of the power of the e-business tool, particularly in the 
Brazilian market.   I forward the information to you because it's my view 
that the   situation directly threatens Enron's credibility in the market at 
a time when some of Enron's competitors (AES and Duke) are not only 
established, but have,  at the same time as Enron's launch at Oil & Gas,  
launched 2nd generation sites. 

2.      Version 2

Brazil and South America. I am convinced that the poor civil infrastructure 
and the physical distances restricting easy access to customers present 
enormous opportunities for e-business platform business (Energy, Financial 
Product and other commodities).   The best example of world class product- 
and service-driven sites to date our, in my view, the on-line banking sites 
(Itau, Bradesco).   They set a good, healthy benchmark. 
IT.   In the development of the site, we need to consider technology 
constraints in the bandwidth capacity and computer screen graphics of 
targeted consumers in Brazil and elsewhere in the region.  The constraings 
limit the degree of dynamism (Flash technology, Sound, 3-d 
graphics/photography, etc.,..) that characterize world-leading sites familiar 
in the US i.e., for now, there is a tradeoff between degree of "sexy-ness " 
of the site vs. prohibitive time to load and navigate. 
e-Biz Expertise. Enron UK has an in-house internet consulting group that 
continues to develop but that provides comprehensive support and development 
services to the product lines ( Houston tends to outsource or contract much 
of the project work ); examples of the work they have produced are available, 
impressive and much closer to cutting edge.   The Enron UK group should own 
the devleopment of version 2 - pls note that there is already a significant 
number of projects in their pipeline.
e-Biz Support/Operations.The operation of the site including specifically the 
IT component which addresses customer response and participation (tracking 
hits voluem, storing profile questionnaire, e-mail response, etc.,..) is 
probably the critical determinant for the functional success of the site.  
Cutting edge technologies and their timely implementation to site or versions 
launch needs to be absolutely mandatory with high deliverables.
Competition. AES, Duke Energy have both launched 2nd versions of their 
regional internet sites in the 6 months between initial launch and today; 
both have upgraded pretty completely in terms of offering and functionality.
Commercial.  The site is designed to streamline and deliver efficiencies and 
value directly to the Commercial ( Trading and Origination ) exercises - 
these groups need to be formally accountable to sign on and contribute to a 
strategy, to initial and sequential content and graphics, language 
translations, etc.,.. Either the Commercial groups drives the e-biz 
initiative, or the e-biz initiative will fail.
Ownerhsip. The breadth and integral importance of both commercial, regulatory 
and IT issues complicate the ability to develop and execute the site 
effectively.  It is a Development business and, as such, needs a clear 
Project Manager (s) with the necessary authority establshed over the 
contributing groups.   

Pls forward any, all inputs and thank you for efforts extended to help 
address the issues.  Note: Please be aware that I understand that to a large 
extent all of the above is outside of my responsibility, but feel I need to 
bring responsible closure to my contributions to and participation in the 
launch of version 1.

Subject: candidate - Monica Matias, PR support for Enron SA - site


Keith, though Commerical has the largest stake in the success or failure of 
the regional e-business product, i understood that  PR has the budget 
allocation and, as agreed regarding the operational support of the site, the 
policing/3rd party role to play i.e., ownership over this particular issue.  

Gentlemen, this site is launched as of last week's Oil&Gas Conference ... or 
certainly maintains an imminent, broader launch.  For starters, we need to 
execute the agenda item outlined below and in previous e-mails which 
allocates operational responsibility for commercial follow-up for the 
site.    

Today the contact resource for Brazil is a voice mail which is temporary 
anyway and wasn't working until I called this morning asking about a message 
I'd left on it last week; in addition, we haven't trained the present 
operational support to understand how and to which groups to direct customer 
inquiries. 

e-bis. the e-business platform needs to get elevated to the next level - 
follow-up for customer capture, responsible and timely response to inquiries, 
etc.,.., not to mention more formal and public marketing of the site.   

phase 2. the natural consequence of having a product and first phase site, is 
that there will be plenty of internal comments and reactive idea generation 
for a second phase site; this is fine and natural, but also will likely fall 
into the responsibilities of the same position - initially at least, in terms 
of information gathering and distribution. 

if really necessary, why don't the relevant parties copied on this wire have 
a 30 minute conference call to make this and other related decisions, so that 
we move forward.  pls consider prioritizing this so that we execute in the 
next few days.

Jose, here is the orginal communication.   

The design of the site is to make progress toward alleviating the enormous 
bottleneck and inefficiencies in the marketing effort to contact ( the 
hundreds of small) national power generators, not to mention streamline the 
customer capture costs for the broader EES product line.    If we don't 
expect a need for a ( and eventually several ) full-time commercial support 
for the site, then the launch will be a dismal failure.     

But with the site "launching"  this week and following a lot of work 
yesterday and this morning cleaning up the kinks in the Monday version, we 
need to be ready get her in position immediately.      What's more, she's 
does almost all of the work carrying the load for the 3 assistants on the 4th 
floor - that work needs (anyway) to get delegated to the other 2 assistants 
ie., they either pick up the slack with competence, or be moved elsewhere.
 
I am in Houston fthr Friday at 713-646-7929 - caution, I don't know (yet) how 
to get any phone messages!

Keith, as discussed, Joao Carlos and  I talked at length and want to propose 
Monica Matias as a candidate to be promoted, full-time into the position you 
outlined and with the additional responsibilities below.

Monica has been an outstanding support to the Direct Sales effort, both in 
terms of consistently competent and proactive contributions but also in terms 
of her enthusiastic "can-do" attitude.   The position is a critical, integral 
support and service function for the Enron SA site launch; Monica's applied 
exposure to and experience with the personnel and content of the Direct Sales 
initiatives will afford her and the group an efficient and timely transition 
in line with the scheduled Oct 15th launch.   

Propose that she report directly to you, Keith, and dotted to Joao Carlos 
Guimaraes, Orlando or Jose. 

Communication Coordinator/Content Manager: The PR offices in Argentina and 
Brazil would be responsible for these tasks, which will entail two primary 
responsibilities: (a) All web-generated inquiries will be received by the PR 
office; they will be logged into an Excel database, and forwarded to the 
appropriate office (commercial, PR, or HR) for a response.  A monthly report 
will be provided to senior management and Houston ESA PR.  This system will 
be centralized by virtue of having the PR office identified.  (b) weekly 
solicitation of identified commercial and regulatory groups for updated text 
and developments, collecting, articulating and distriubting to key Enron 
managers customer feedback, inputting information of closed transactions, and 
communicating to key Enron managers update on the ongoing improvements to the 
site.

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to "soak up liquidity" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself," said 
Altra's Coleman. "But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another." 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply "providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace." 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "Big Brother" 
of the energy marketplace. 

"The historical information is not available," EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well." He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

PaperExchange CEO steps down
December 08, 2000 01:35 PM PT
by Adam Feuerstein

Kent Dolby, president and CEO of PaperExchange, resigned unexpectedly 
Thursday, adding to the mounting turmoil at the independent Net marketplace 
for the pulp and paper industry.

Dolby's resignation, for personal reasons, comes a little more than a month 
after the company laid off 14 percent of its workforce in a major retooling 
of its business plan. Dolby joined PaperExchange -- 83 percent owned by 
Internet Capital Group (ICGE) -- in December 1999.


Bob Brenner, PaperExchange's current chief technology officer, is being 
promoted to the CEO post. Duane Desisto, currently CFO and chief operating 
officer, will become president.


Company executives, including Dolby, were not available to discuss the 
management shifts, but the moves were confirmed by a company spokeswoman.


Brenner's ascension may be linked to PaperExchange's decision to focus less 
on its online exchange for excess paper products, and concentrate instead on 
developing and selling Internet-based business applications for the pulp and 
paper industry.


Dolby may also be a victim of the fickleness of the b-to-b sector. When he 
joined the company, independent Net markets were the poster children for 
successful b-to-b ventures. But in the ensuing months, industry-sponsored 
marketplaces -- ventures set up by big industry players -- have risen to the 
top, forcing indie Net markets onto the b-to-b endangered list.


PaperExchange faces considerable competiton from ForestExpress, a marketplace 
sponsored by industry giants Weyerhaeuser (WY), International Paper (IP), 
Georgia-Pacific (GP), Mead (MEA), Boise Cascade and Willamette (WLL).


ForestExpress may or may not grow into a successful b-to-b marketplace, but 
its very existence has dominated b-to-b activity in the pulp and paper 
industry, and has essentially frozen any progress PaperExchange was making.


The pickle in which PaperExchange finds itself is also being viewed, by some, 
as an indictment of Internet Capital Group.


In September, ICG boosted its stake in the company from 20 percent to 83 
percent, in exchange for 4.8 million shares of ICG common stock. The deal 
came at a time when ForestExpress was showing signs of life and when indie 
Net markets in general were falling into disfavor and were being all but 
ignored by most venture capitalists.


ICG's fortunes have tumbled lately because many of its b-to-b investments are 
not paying off for shareholders. Last month, the company announced plans to 
cut costs, reduce its investment spending and refocus efforts on 15 
"developed" companies in its portfolio -- companies that have the best 
near-term shot at initial public offerings.


PaperExchange was not named as one of those "developed" companies.


An ICG spokeswoman defends the investment in PaperExchange, acknowledging the 
company needs to help in developing its business model further -- a role ICG 
is uniquely positioned to play.


"We have accumulated a lot of knowledge about b-to-b that has helped us build 
some leading b-to-b businesses," said Michelle Strykowski. "Our investment in 
PaperExchange is an educated bet based on that proven experience."

Deborah,

When I met last w/you, Bill, and others, it was stated that Fastow's group 
was scheduled to move off floor 27 the weekend of 8/25.  I have just heard 
that they are not moving off until 9/8?  Is this the case?

Many Thanks,

Liz

Wes, several months ago I sent you a memo (which I have attached to this 
E-mail for ease of reference) describing that the State of Texas had notified 
the Tax Department that it intended to audit the tax returns for Risk 
Management & Trading Corp. ("RMT") for  the 1998 through 2000 tax years.  
Greg, this is the legal entity about which I spoke to you several months ago 
and of which you serve as its Senior Management.  We were recently notified 
by the State of Texas that it had completed its audit and review of RMT's 
returns and that NO ADJUSTMENTS would be proposed.  As I outlined in my 
earlier memo to Wes, the RMT arrangement has increased earnings of Enron by 
approximately$30 million since 1997.  The Tax Department is extremely proud 
of our defense of Enron's interests in this matter and I would be delighted 
to speak with you about this should you desire.  Best regards.  SHD.

Flip Resigns From divine Post, Starts Band

(Buzzed M.S.P. - For Immediate Release)  divine, Inc. CEO, Andrew "Flip"
Filopowski, has resigned from the organization and will soon begin
touring with his blues band, in support of his new album,
"Multi-Millionaire's Blues."

"divine is in sound financial shape," Filiposwki said in a press
conference earlier today.  "I'm comfortable leaving divine to fend for
itself as I move on to greater opportunities.  When I came to the
realization that divine, and to a lesser extent, Chicago's Internet
presence, could exist without my constant presence and supervision, I
began searching for another field I could put my stamp on and
elevate."

Filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music.
Specifically, the music of the Blues.  Filipowski, formed a back-up
band, "The Cronies," consisting, as is his custom, of former Platinum
Technologies employees.

"I realized that divine was not sufficiently about promoting myself,"
Filipowski continued.  "As such, I consulted the Reverend Jesse Jackson,
as Rev. Jackson is the only person I could think of that might be
qualified to advise me on self-promotion.  Eventually we determined,
much as Rev. Jackson had become much-beloved for reading Doctor Seuss on
television, that were I to record an album, perhaps the general public
could come to hold the sound of my voice in the same high esteem that I
do."

Filipowski says his decision to take up the Blues was because of the
musical genre's strong association with Chicago and under-performing
record sales.  "People say I don't know what the Blues are about,"
Filipowski commented.  "To me, anything that's not performing up to its
potential has the Blues, be it a company, somebody who bothered to get
an MBA from Harvard, or even entire musical style.  From where I'm
sitting, the Blues has the Blues."

Filipowski is on record as intending "to single-handedly save the
Chicago Blues industry."

Filipowski's signature tune, "I Sold a Company For $200 Million and I
Can't Get No Respect," appears to have a hit a popular chord with
Silicon Valley executives, generating enough buzz for Filipowski to
predict a platinum record for the single.

Other tunes on the album include: "The IPO Blues," "I Can't Remember
Which Residence I Left My Baby In," and a remake of "Careless Whispers"
dedicated to Chicago Internet watchdog, Ron May.

When asked for comment, Chicago Blues legend Buddy Guy could only stare
blankly and repeat the words of author Joseph Conrad:  "The horror.  The
horror."

Dispelling the Myth - The Universe Does Not Revolve Around Technology

By The Big Head

Much like the medieval myth that the Sun and the entire universe
revolving around the Earth, for the last 5 years, our economy has been
guided by a similar myth. The myth that technology was and would drive
our economy.

In the last 12 months, however, those of us in the technology field have
felt like our entire world has collapsed around us. With layoffs,
closing of dot coms, the nosedive of the Nasdaq, the disappearance of
angel investors, and the barricading of the doors to funding, it seems
like our entire world has fallen on dark times.

To our mind, and the minds of all of the financial community, the entire
universe revolved around the failings of our technology sector, and if
so, then the economy was surely doomed. I, being at the epicenter of
technology for over 5 years, tended to agree with these sentiments.

But miraculously, something strange has happened. In a strange twist of
revelation, people are beginning to point out that the universe, indeed,
does not revolve around the planet of technology; it instead revolves
around the economy as a whole.

Key planetary indicators like: housing, consumer spending, large ticket
items, and automobiles are all holding strong. Indeed, it is
increasingly clear that technology was merely one planet in the entire
economic universe. And as we now know, all planets revolve around the
Sun, not around the Earth. The universal economy as a whole is more like
our solar system and is made up of many factors, all microcosms in and
of themselves - much like moons and asteroids revolving around a single
planet, but yet all truly still revolving around Sol, the core of our
system.

So instead of a revolutionary idea driving our economy, the economic
philosophers of old are coming back into vogue. As they have always
said: it was always about the Sun. Technology is a part of our economic
universe - a planet perhaps, maybe only a moon, but certainly not the
Sun.

Here are some interesting statistics gathered from a recent study: The
study from the Pew Internet & American Life Project serves up a heaping
dose of reality to those who were wearing new-economy blinders. Pew
estimates only one in six Americans has been
touched by dot-com death - either knowing someone who was laid off,
missing a favorite site or losing money invested in the Net.

Some particulars:
? Just 7 percent say they've lost money on a dot-com-related investment;

? Only 8 percent lost one of their favorite sites because of the dot-com
downturn;
? And while TheStandard.com's Layoff Tracker has tallied nearly 65,000
lost jobs among Internet-related businesses, just 9 percent of those
surveyed by Pew knew someone let go from an Internet Economy position.

? More than two-thirds of the respondents said they hadn't closely
followed the dot-com devastation, and one out of three said they didn't
know anything about the cratering of the Internet Economy.

And this recently from Crains in Chicago: "Despite economic slowing, the
Chicago region added nearly 56,000 jobs in the 12 month period ended
March 2000, hitting a record total and the highest total employment in a
decade.

How can that be?

The tech world is collapsing! Life will cease to exist! The world will
come to a stop!
This can't be! Everything revolves around my planet of technology!

No, more likely, we will look back on this "collapse," years from now
and consider it nothing more than a celestial eclipse. Though we in the
technology world feel like we are in a total eclipse of the sun, the
other planets (economic indicators for those not
following the astronomy analogy) are in a partial eclipse, if they are
in one at all.

So think of the technology sector as being in a brief time when all in
the world seems bathed in darkness. But what was our "light" based upon?
Tech values were non-sensible and out of line, consumer spending was
higher than cost of living increases, a false sense of wealth and
prosperity had set in, 20-something's were spending more cash in a year
than they will ever see in their lifetime, companies focused on hiring
and expansion as opposed to prudent management of funds, and the list
goes on and on.

Yes, as we approached the eclipse, we thought the sun revolved around
our planet and as we were the center of the economic universe, we felt
we could do no wrong. However, the Sun, that great epicenter of the
entire economy, has cast a shadow on our lowly planet of technology.
Thus reminding us once again that all is in order in the universe. Will
the Sun shine again? Of course it will. Will we be the center of the
economic universe, no, and we should never expect to be - no planet is
ever thus.

So, right now, the ones panicking from an absence of sunlight are the
youngsters who have never seen or experienced an eclipse before. If you
are still not following, I am referring to an economic downturn, a slow
down, a correction, or at worst, a recession.

Yes, if you talk to wise old sages (those over 35 who at least felt the
pinch of the 87 crash and those of the 50's, 60's and 70's), they will
tell you it was always like this. Sometimes the sun shines on you, and
sometimes you are left in the dark.

With my brief history in technology, Sunshine and prosperity is all I
have known. But I should have known, history doth have a way of
repeating itself. I often used to hear, "Son, you weren't around when
the bio tech's were going crazy". The reference being, that all
explosively absurd events go through a correction, an eclipse if you
will. History is fraught with such examples: biotech, oil, gold,
automobiles, railroads, gold again, tulips, and once even, spices like
pepper and cumin, the list goes on.

What will the next planet be that thinks the Sun doth revolve around it?


Yes, history doth have a way of repeating itself, however in the long
run; no matter what planet you are on, you will be in the light more
often than the dark.

HEADLINES OF THE WEEK - 5/16/00


Eppraisals.com Appraises Self, Finds Out It's Worthless

(Evanston, IL) Eppraisals.com, who had received $15.5 million in venture
capital from angel investors, including Casey Cowell and venture capital
firms New World Ventures, Tribune Ventures, BlueStar Ventures and Plum
Capital, decided to test it's software on itself last week, and in a
stunning surprise, found that it was only worth $15 bucks.  A devastated
Leslie Hindman was cited as saying: "I just can't believe it, we were
spending money hand over fist assuming we would easily be worth $400
million, and our software told us otherwise."

Hindman also indicated that their corporate checkbook contained $1.34,
which she took as another indication that their valuation may have been
off a little.  It is rumored that appraisals of all of the staff by the
software, indicated lower values than expected as well.

Tom Thornton Rumored to be Newest Internet Billionaire

(Chicago, IL)  Tom Thornton, former divine Interventures executive, has
finally revealed the ugly truth - he profited from the Internet!
Contrary to popular public opinion, Mr. Thornton did not leave divine
because of the company's shift in direction from "incubator" to
"software developer". Rumors indicated that Mr. Thornton actually left
because he was too wealthy!

May Report Editor, Ron May has offered up proof to this effect by
publishing a secret purchase by Thornton of a $17 million dollar
sailboat.  The boat easily proves that Thornton profited heavily from
his involvement at divine. Inside information says that Thornton was
granted 600 million shares of divine stock for a loan of only 2 cents,
so even if divine stock has plummeted from over $9.00 to its current
$1.80, Tom is still in the pink.

MarchFIRST Files to change Name to AprilFIRST

(Chicago, IL)  Internet consulting firm MarchFIRST filed in U.S.
District Court to change the name of the company. More in keeping with
its current business model, which is, of course, to be out of business.
Bob Bernard, MarchFirst's former president and spokesperson was quoted
as saying, "Answering the phone with AprilFIRST is much more appropriate
than our current greeting."

In a related story, the Company also took time while at court to file
for Chapter 7.  Bernard was cited as saying that this paperwork was far
less significant than the name change.

Internet Executives Club Ltd. Holds Meeting, No One Attends.

(Evanston, IL) The IEC 's recent meeting at the Evanston Hilton finds no
attendees. Alex Jarett, spokesperson for the club, responded to our
queries with a puzzled retort.  I just don't get it, I sent invitations
out like I always do and no one showed up."  Asked who normally
attended, he responded, "Here, look at our list; Under "B", there's
Bernard, Bob; under "D" there's Doyle, Paul; under "L" Lederer, William
. . . "

When we left, he was still reciting names and mumbling. The last one we
heard him say was "under "W" there's Weinstein, David".


Deloitee & Touche "Tech Fast 50" Gets Speeding Ticket.

(Chicago, IL) Deloitee & Touche was having trouble getting nominees for
their annual 50 hottest high tech companies in the Chicago area. Reason
seemed to be that the companies were speeding on their way out of town.
Among the current nominees are: divine Interventures, AprilFirst,
Xpedior, and Blue Meteor.  D&T spokesperson H. R. Gabble said: These
companies are moving so fast that we just can't seem to get a hold of
them.

KNOCKNOW sent packing from SpringBoard 2001

(Chicago, IL)  Members of the famous Internet networking association
were sent packing by ushers at the Springboard 2001 event.  It seems
that in a typographical error, the nametags of Mr. Stephen Meade and Bob
Gerometta inadvertently had their organization's name misspelled as
"KNOCKUP".

Springboard spokesperson Merrill Lieberman was overheard to have said:
"Those two VIPs think they can get away with anything.  Just because
Meade has cornered the market on Chicago blondes and Gerometta has a 19
year-old wife is no excuse to start a company with a name so offensive
to women!"  When explained about the misspelling, and the current impact
of KNOCKNOW on the local tech community, Ms. Lieberman was cited as
retorting, "Oh, and I suppose they let women attend their exclusive
club, too."

USA: Dynegy trades $1.5 bln via online energy portal.

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity marketer 
Dynegy Inc. said on Monday its Dynegydirect Internet trading system had 
chalked up $1.5 billion in notional transaction values since its launch on 
Nov. 1. 
Dynegydirect (www.dynegydirect.com) currently carries Dynegy's bid and offer 
prices for over 300 energy and energy-related products, including North 
American electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Coal, emission allowances and weather derivatives will be offered in the 
first quarter of 2001, with international energy products and 
telecommunications bandwidth following in the second quarter, Houston-based 
Dynegy said in a statement. 
Dynegydirect currently has over 400 registered users and Dynegy said that 
over $1 billion of the deals done to date over the system were generated by 
new customers for the company. 
In addition to its own portal, Dynegy has been trading on the Tradespark 
(www.trade-spark.com) multilateral online energy trading platform launched in 
September. 
Tradespark is backed by a partnership of several energy companies, including 
Williams Cos., TXU Corp. and privately owned Koch Industries. Dynegy has said 
it will join the partnership at a later date. 
Dynegy's home-town rival Enron Corp. is regarded as the frontrunner in online 
trading of wholesale energy products, with deals worth $183 billion 
transacted over its EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) system between November 
1999 and October 2000. 
Enron executives have said they also plan to use other online trading 
platforms to do business and will not focus exclusively on the company's own 
platform.

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational 
issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to 
take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing 
business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is 
whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the

during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to

Instinet IPO Soars On Debut 
Mark Lewis, Forbes.com, 05.18.01, 1:30 PM ET 

NEW YORK - Any successful initial public offering is good news for Wall 
Street these days, but Instinet's debut was especially auspicious--not just 
for the moribund IPO market but for the electronic networks that are supposed 
to usher investors into the digital future. 

Instinet (nasdaq: INET - news - people) is Wall Street's oldest and largest 
electronic communications network (ECN), of the sort that matches buyers and 
sellers directly rather than forcing them to go through an intermediary. 
Instinet raised $464 million when it priced above its expected range at 
$14.50 per share. The stock opened this morning at $17 and was up 30%, to 
$18.19, in midday trading. 

That performance was a vindication for Instinet's corporate parent, Reuters 
Group (nasdaq: RTRSY - news - people), the London-based media and financial 
services giant, which retains 86% of the newly public ECN. Reuters had been 
criticized for taking Instinet public during a weak IPO market. 

[Full disclosure: The author of this piece is a former Reuters reporter, and 
Reuters' venture capital Greenhouse Fund is an investor in Forbes.com.] 

Since Reuters acquired Instinet in 1987, it and the other ECNs have evolved 
into a major threat to the established stock exchanges. Instinet's successful 
IPO could prompt similar moves by such rivals as Island and Archipelago. And 
it also bodes well for Nasdaq's plan to take itself public sometime next 
year. 

"The Instinet IPO further legitimizes electronic trading for the broad 
investment community," said TowerGroup analyst Robert Iati in a recent 
interview. TowerGroup is a research firm that studies the impact of 
technology on the financial services industry. 

When the Instinet IPO first was discussed several years ago, some observers 
expected it to establish a market valuation that would exceed the worth of 
Reuters itself. Those were the heady days of the Internet boom, when the new 
online brokerages, investment banks and ECNs seemed destined to triumph over 
Wall Street's old-fashioned ways. 

But the traditional broker-dealers, banks and stock exchanges have been 
adapting to the digital challenge, and, meanwhile, the stock market's swoon 
cut into online trading volumes. So nowadays, expectations for the ECNs are 
less exuberant. Instinet's IPO-established valuation of $3.5 billion is 
relatively modest, given that the parent company's current market cap is 
around $20 billion and that Instinet contributes about one-fifth of Reuters' 
revenues. 

Reuters has pulled back from plans to turn Instinet into a more 
retail-oriented operation. But the ECN's wholesale trading volumes remain 
robust. Instinet last year took in revenue of $1.2 billion and posted a 
divisional profit of $234 million. Reuters intends to maintain majority 
control of Instinet, which will be housed in the flashy new Reuters Building 
at Times Square. 

Now that it is public, Instinet can use its stock as currency to acquire 
other ECNs. Instinet already owns a stake in Archipelago, the Chicago-based 
ECN whose backers include Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people), Merrill 
Lynch (nyse: MER - news - people) and E*Trade Group (nyse: ET - news - people
). Another potential consolidation play is Island, a New York-based ECN 
backed by several private equity firms and by online brokerage Datek Online 
Holdings. 

Apart from acquisitions, Instinet also can use some of its IPO proceeds to 
continue upgrading its technology--a pressing need for all ECNs, which must 
remain competitive as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange become ever 
more adept at the electronic trading game. 

Finally, being a public company has a symbolic value for Instinet. This IPO 
sets a precedent by establishing an ECN as a high-profile player on Wall 
Street. That will boost the Instinet brand--and those of its rivals. This is 
the first ECN to go public, but it won't be the last.

Joannie,

Per our conversation, I believe the intent of the visit today by Tom Boren
and Lyn Maddox is to brief Mr. Skilling (and others he would like to have
present) about the National Energy Group by telling them about our corporate
structure, financial structure, ratings, ring fencing and answer any
questions they might have regarding our overall crediworthiness.

Thank you,
Rose

Scott,

Thanks again for hosting lunch recently in Dallas.  I appreciated the open 
discussion around your iPlanet business as well as your views on Microsoft.

As it relates to Java and Enron, we will get you an e-mail soon that 
summarizes the issues we brought up.

Subject: CPUC Decision Suspending Direct Access

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).  

Jim

Subject: AIG Highstar

Friday is the day when we are supposed to close the Alamac sale to AIG 
Highstar.  Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our 
potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we 
view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following.    
Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a 
second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a 
percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, 
despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund).

We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this 
immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at 
the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no 
return.  As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through 
Joe.  We are not in the business of doing work for this fund.

Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of 
why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.  I recognize that 
contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you 
think differently and I hope you are right.  My view is that we need to get 
out as we have no control over their investments.  I have spoken to Brian 
Stanley on this fund and Brian is (unless someone in his group has a reason 
not to)  happy to follow whatever approach we take particularly as EE&CC is 
no longer a EPC company.

Dear Sir or Madam :

 Enron Corp. (=01&Enron=018) believes in conducting its business affairs in=
=20
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of=
=20
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=
es=20
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=
r=20
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=
=20
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that=20
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department wil=
l=20
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and=
=20
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical=
=20
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. =
=20
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

Greg,
     It was great to meet you in Houston.  Beth Gordon and I appreciated
the time you gave us and found the discussion really worthwhile.
Obviously, I hope you two can work out some cooperation.   Hope to see
again either in DC or Houston; at IFC, we certainly will pursue you guys on
the weather side.
All the best for the holidays.
Nina

As previously indicated, we expect to secure permission from the lenders to 
submit our preliminary termination notice PTN to MSEB.  It appears that this 
may occur today, but that the strongest likelihood is that we would have the 
submission going out on either Saturday morning or even stretching into 
Monday or Tuesday of next week.  

Attached is the statement we planned to use with the media.  We will keep you 
apprised of further developments.

Please let me know if you require additional information.

Greg, still nothing firm about that, both utilities are screaming for relief. 
Gov Davis refered to 13 companies as the Dirty 13 for not selling into CA, 
Enron was one. That was off Wire this morning. FERC intervened yesterday. 
What is long term affect? Most utilities are concerned still problem. Ben

As you know, John and I now have quarterly business reviews with each of our 
business and commercial support units and I thought it might be helpful to 
provide you with a brief overview of Q1 and the areas of focus going forward 
prior to your visit.

IBIT 

? Enron Europe delivered Q1 IBIT of $86.9m ($6.4m over target).  This is 
after covering Margaux losses of $12.2m not in plan. 
? Net Income at $54.1m was $25m over target after absorbing Margaux losses.  
This is due to:
- $10m interest savings from the Camelot transaction, which has now moved 
more of the metal inventory financing costs into gross margin.
- the adoption of FAS 133 which produced a net gain of $13m as a result of 
marking to market contracts which were previously accounted for on an 
accruals basis.
? On a like for like basis compared to 2000, our Gas and Power businesses  
(UK, Continental, ETOL and Enron Direct) have (circa) doubled IBIT from $70m 
to $134m and Net Income from $46m to $107m.
? Metals generated a net loss before taxes of $54.6m.  This comprised gross 
margin of $7.7m, expenses of $42.5m and interest of $19.8m (net of receipts). 
(This does not include interest on funds used for the MG acquisition).


EXPENSES

? Reduction in our expense base continues to be a significant focus, 
resulting in lower than plan expenses of $16m.  If you exclude metals which 
is $10m over plan and the $8.8m bonus accrual against $5m in the plan, you 
will note that we reduced our expenses by approximately $29m in the rest of 
our business.  The plan itself was materially lower than that presented to 
John and I by the business and support groups. We are therefore making 
significant progress in respect of reducing our expenses, we expect continued 
savings to be made particularly as we are able to start extracting savings 
from the metals business.


HEADCOUNT

? We are about 50 down on plan for headcount and I would expect this trend to 
continue. Again we will see significant headcount reductions when the metals 
systems are functioning (Metals headcount is 622 with an additional 70 full 
time staff working on Metals support).
? Headcount will be reduced by over 20 in the Middle East.
(NB. The headcount numbers include full time temp and contract staff, which 
make up about 10% of our headcount)


TRAVEL & ENTERTAINMENT

? Total costs are down 25% on budget with the total number of flights down by 
58% on budget. The major spender is Metals which accounts for 25% of all 
costs.


OVERSEAS OFFICES

?  We are in the middle of a full scale review of each of our offices and 
will close or downsize those that do not make sense from a P&L or franchise 
perspective.

IT

?  IT is 18% of our headcount and accounts for 25% of our salaries and wages, 
14% of our G&A spend and 10% of our consultancy spend.  We have already made 
significant progress in this area, our headcount has been flat over the last 
6 months and we have introduced a series of measures to increase the 
accountability and focus of the IT group and to ensure resource is allocated 
effectively.  Mark Pickering is presently working with Booz Allen to identify 
and address additional areas of savings.  Finally and most importantly in 
this area we are working with the commercial groups to ensure that they "own" 
the IT projects and development, which will minimise waste and increase focus.

MIDDLE/BACK OFFICE

? Middle and back office operations constitute 13% of our headcount and 11% 
of our salaries and wages. Fernley has kicked off a review which he believes 
will save us 20% on headcount and costs.

FINANCING COSTS

? Our financing costs in Q1 amounted to $58.7m and with the focus on funds 
flow targets this number will be higher in the future. This area is one which 
will receive massive focus going forward. 

The key areas are;
 - reduction in Metals financing costs
 - effective use of the desks to create funds flow rather than use of 
expensive bank deals
 - focus on reducing cost of external funding
 - creation of an EnronEurope treasury function.


GROSS MARGIN

On the gross margin side, whilst the targets are extremely challenging our 
core business is well positioned provided we can address the excessive cost 
burden.

In respect of the trading side of our business:-
? UK Power continues to be our most significant source of income and whilst 
NETA has created some significant challenges it also raises great 
opportunities for us.
? Continental Power still lacks volatility but we are seeing some reasonable 
earnings.
? Scandinavian Power is a significant opportunity for us and we have made 
$20m so far this quarter and we like the positions we have going forward.
? UK & Continental Gas continue to be difficult - we lack an information 
advantage at this point.
? Metals continues to be a difficult trading market and with the systems 
problems we are having we are taking relatively small positions.

On the origination side (as you will see from the "hotlist") we are starting 
to see some significant deal flow particularly in the UK gas and power 
markets.  In addition, there are a number of good renewables opportunities 
together with some interesting opportunities at ETOL and TPL.

On the continent we are also seeing an ever increasing number of deals but 
the big deals are still likely to arise on an opportunistic basis although I 
am very bullish on where certain of the markets will be over the next 18-24 
months.

For the first time we have doable origination deals in Scandinavia and this 
is also an increasing focus for us.

There are some outstanding possibilities for long-term structured Metals 
deals, however most of them have a considerable lead time and I only expect a 
few deals this year while we develop the opportunities/franchise which will 
allow the Metals business to take off in 2002.  I do not expect Metals to be 
anywhere near P&L positive this year but I am extremely bullish on the 
franchise value and the possibilities for significant earnings going forward. 
We have massive resource working on sorting our systems (likely to be 
complete early 2002) and that together with a 30-50% reduction in the 
headcount and costs will allow us to have a sustainable and profitable 
business going forward.

We also have a number of great origination opportunities for Enron Credit, 
particularly on the portfolio side of the business which I expect to develop 
significant earnings this year.

We have disbanded the finance origination group with the individuals becoming 
part of the UK, Continental and Renewables groups to ensure closer focus on 
deals the business units want rather than illiquid positions (where we always 
seem to be giving our money to someone else) that always seem to be the 
preserve of this sort of group.  The extra origination resource will help the 
groups deliver on some good opportunities.

MIDDLE EAST/MARGAUX/CATS

Although, as you know we would argue that these areas should not be for the 
account of Enron Europe, we are working them very hard.

Middle East 

When we took over the Middle East business there was $68.8m of costs on the 
balance sheet with over 30 people developing projects with no realistic 
probability of an acceptable return. The office has been downsized and will 
be purely LNG going forward. We have recovered $3m from Dolphin and have 
served the termination notice to recover a further $25m.  We are fighting 
hard to recover as much as possible of the remaining $15m spent on Dolphin, 
the $22.5m on Gaza and $3m on Oman (and $1m on a deal in Pakistan!).   To the 
extent that we have to take a hit we will manage it over a number of quarters 
(we are in discussion with a number of parties re all the above).

CATS

Fernley and his team worked hard to ensure that the hit for Enron was the 
absolute minimum possible being $20.3m (IBIT) and $13.4m (interest), which 
will have to be taken this quarter. The remaining $108m has been taken to the 
balance sheet as a deferred expense, so this will have a capital charge in 
respect of it going forward.

Margaux/Whitewing

As mentioned above, Enron Europe covered losses of $12.2m in Q1 in respect of 
the Margaux financing.  We are expecting losses in Q2 of approx $14.5m.  We 
have two teams working the situation very hard.  Global finance in London are 
focussing on opportunities to re-finance and/or identify P&L positive 
opportunities from the structure to offset the losses. We have one or two 
interesting possibilities. In addition Eric Shaw has a team totally focussed 
on finding incremental value from the underlying assets to enable us to have 
greater scope to sell the assets.  We need to find somewhere in the region of 
$115m of incremental value to enable us to do this.  We will sell all of the 
underlying assets as soon as it is possible to do so.

JAPAN ENCOM

EnCom has an annual cost base of approximately $10m and the expenditure is 
likely to increase.  It has a number of interesting opportunities that it is 
pursuing but they are extremely long-term and at a very early stage. Our game 
plan is to get ourselves into a position, as quickly as possible, to be able 
to monetise our interest both at the holding company and project levels.

JAPAN ENRON

As you know we believe that the power market will not open quickly enough to 
justify the resource that was going to be focussed on it.  The opportunities 
are clearly in the global markets area.  We will focus on Metals and Enron 
Credit in that region. We will provide commercial support to Global Markets 
and re-charge the costs.

AUSTRALIA

We are not making enough of this market but are adding some very good 
origination resource to enable Paul Quilkey to take advantage of some 
interesting opportunities.



I attach an appendix setting out a more detailed breakdown of our actual 
numbers v plan, Q1 2001 v Q1 2000 on a like for like basis and a more 
detailed expenses and headcount breakdown. 

If you wish to discuss please give me a call, alternatively we can discuss in 
more detail when you are over in the next couple of weeks.

the size.

Thank you for your hospitality.  There were a couple of questions I had 
regarding our visit, some of which we left you with before our return to 
Washington.

I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding 
where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require 
customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage 
data regarding cookies?

Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices 
and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If 
yes, when?

In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the 
risk management groups?  How is the information used?

Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, 
in what form and for how long?

Thanks

Subject: 7 leading banks and energy concerns announced on Tuesday they had 
joined forces to launch an online electronic market for trading over 
-the-counter (OTC) energy, metals and other commodities.




     By Richard Mably
   LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Seven leading banks and energy concerns
announced on Tuesday they had joined forces to launch an online electronic
market for trading over-the-counter (OTC) energy, metals and other
commodities.
   In the biggest foray yet on to the internet in those markets, the venture
said it planned to begin trading various petroleum and precious-metals based
OTC products later this year.
   It also intends to develop additional markets for global natural gas,
electrical power and a variety of base metals in due course.
   The companies are BP Amoco <BPA.L>, Royal/Dutch Shell <RD.AS> <SHEL.L>,
Totalfina <TOTF.PA>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter <MWD_pe.N> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>.
   The seven founders, already among the largest players on energy and
commodity markets, said they had made a commitment to provide initial market
liquidity for the new exchange -- called IntercontinentalExchange.
   Neal Shear, global head of commodities at Morgan Stanley, said that in
markets now valued at $1.8 trillion annually, electronic trading could
significantly reduce trading costs.
   "The capabilities provided ... will offer OTC participants increased
market transparency, liquidity and efficiency while preserving the anonymity
most market participants require," the companies said in a joint statement.

   ATLANTA-BASED, USING ESTABLISHED PLATFORM
   The exchange will be headed by Jeffrey Sprecher, previously President of
Atlanta's Continental Power Exchange, the company which developed the
trading system to be used by IntercontinentalExchange.
   Peter Ward, a director of Shell International Trading and Shipping
Company said: "We believe we have established a professional marketplace for
professional market participants. Our markets will be open to all who have a
business interest in them without any artificial restrictions."
   Some think the electronic OTC market could provide tough competition for
futures exchanges despite providing lesser guarantees than more tightly
regulated contracts.
   "If the market becomes mature enough, liquid enough and enough players
take an active part in its development, it could take a good stake from the
futures market," said one European oil trader not involved in the venture.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's leading energy futures
market, last week said it had declined a proposal by Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs to team up on an electronic communications network.
   Traditional broking houses might also lose out although dealers said an
electronic market could not replicate the sort of information provided
person-to-person by brokers.
   "The idea definitely has merit. But I don't believe it is going to be the
immediate downfall of brokers. If you look at the trading screen what kind
of information do you get? Very little," said Bo van Wijk of Standard Bank
of London.
   The seven companies said there would be no formal membership of the
exchange and no dues or fees beyond those incurred in the process of
trading.
   Currently the bulk of trading in the wholesale OTC energy and metals
markets is conducted on the telephone. Beyond the benefits of electronic
links, the exchange will create a "paperless back office," the companies
said.
   They also plan to develop facilities which would permit participants to
clear and settle OTC products.

USA: ICE says 150 mln bbls oil traded in first month.

NEW YORK - The IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said Friday it had traded 150 
million barrels of crude and refined products since the October 12 launch of 
its web-based energy trading platform.

It marks a 110 million barrel rise in cumulative oil volumes since October 26 
for the online venture, backed by some of the world's biggest energy firms 
and offering derivative contracts outside regulated exchanges for energy and 
metals.

ICE said it traded more than 2 million megawatt hours of power on Thursday, 
its highest yet.

The site has traded a total 800 million mmBTUs (million British Thermal 
Units) of natural gas and natural gas derivatives, and 22 million 
megawatt-hours of firm power as of close of trading November 16.

ICE has also traded a total of 15 million gold and gold equivalent ounces 
since precious metals contracts were launched on August 24, the company said 
in a statement.

Some 85 of the world's largest energy and financial commodity firms are 
participating in its contracts, it added. The total notional value for all 
OTC products traded to date on ICE is over $13 billion.

Original partners in the Atlanta-based exchange are BP Amoco Plc , 
Royal/Dutch Shell , TotalFina , Goldman Sachs , Societe Generale ,Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter and Deutsche Bank .

In July, six further gas and power partners were recruited - American 
Electric Power , Utilicorp's Aquila Energy , Duke Energy , El Paso Energy , 
Reliant Energy and Southern Company Energy Marketing .

There are currently at least 16 other energy trading Web sites on the 
Internet, but traders have said that with the backing of seven major banks 
and oil companies, ICE could provide the stiffest challenge yet to 
traditional ways of doing business.

CheMatch.com has layoffs, expects new financing
Nov 20, 2000 08:57 AM ET 

HOUSTON, Nov. 20 -- CheMatch.com Inc., an Internet marketplace for buying and 
selling bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products, has completed a 
restructuring that involved layoffs, and it expects to secure additional 
funding by the end of the year. 

"We did have a restructuring and a handful of layoffs," Clay Jeansonne, 
CheMatch.com spokesman confirmed to LocalBusiness.com late Friday. "The 
company reviews its structure periodically." 

CheMatch.com was started in 1998 and has posted six consecutive quarters of 
growth. At one point, the company had 93 employees, and it currently has 85 
employees, Jeansonne said. 

Jeansonne said the company expects to bring in new funding from venture 
capital companies and from technology companies. He declined to elaborate on 
the possible amount of funding. 

"We do expect to get some additional funding by the end of the year," he 
said. 

Already the company's strategic and financial investors include Battery 
Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC; Dupont 
(NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE)and Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH). 

October IPO postponed
The possibility of raising more money privately was part of the reason that 
CheMatch.com withdrew its initial public offering on Oct. 6. "We had nibbles 
out there so we postponed the IPO," Jeansonne told LocalBusiness.com. 

Market conditions also were cited as the reason in documents filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. CheMatch.com had filed for the IPO on 
March 1, and in April had set the price at $10 to $12 a share and the number 
of shares at 5 million. It had requested to be traded on the Nasdaq under the 
symbol "CHEM" but had made no move to actually start selling stock. 

CheMatch.com's competitors include ChemCross of Houston and ChemConnect of 
San Francisco. ChemConnect had filed for an IPO in the spring but withdrew 
the offering during the summer, saying it would wait until the IPO market 
improves. 

Partnerships continue
In mid-September, CheMatch.com and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced 
a joint agreement to develop a co-branded complex of certain petrochemical 
futures and options products to trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's 
GLOBEX2 electronic trading system. 

This marked the first joint development project between the futures exchange 
and a business-to-business marketplace to create risk management products for 
a specific industry, a news release at the time said. 

In late September, CheMatch.com announced a total of more than 1 million 
metric tons of product had been traded on its network, representing some $350 
million worth of transactions. The average transaction value is worth more 
than $500,000. 

Third-quarter 2000 trading reflected completed transactions from more than 70 
member companies. The physical product offering has grown from eight products 
at this time last year to 63 products currently.

PwC to launch online CO2 exchange

PricewaterhouseCoopers is poised to launch a major online marketplace for 
trading in greenhouse gas emissions. PwC, which has formed CO2e.com in 
partnership with the Cantor Fitzgerald, is expected to announce the portal 
tomorrow at the climate change conference in The Hague.

Trading in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) is 
expected to play a key role in global efforts to combat global warming and 
climate change by reducing emissions overall.

There is fierce debate as to whether countries which cannot meet their 
emission targets under international protocols, or do not wish to, should be 
able to buy emission "credits" from countries which can.

In future individual companies may also have "permits" to emit greenhouse 
gases which they could trade like any other commodity. According to Steve 
Drummond, PwC's global head of Climate Change Financial Advisory Services, 
trading in greenhouse gases may become one of the fastest growing commodity 
markets in the world.

Trading in emissions has been the subject of heated discussion since the 1997 
Kyoto meeting on climate change. CO2e.com hopes to exploit the fact that, 
under the Kyoto protocol, which has yet to be signed off, trading in emission 
reductions may be banked now by companies and used against emissions 
obligations which may be set by law in the future.

"The emission reductions now can be offset against those which can be made in 
the future. The risk could be that the protocol will not be signed, but this 
really started at the Rio summit in 1992 and everything is on track so far," 
Drummond said.

"There is huge momentum behind this."

Drummond said CO2e.com will act not just as an online marketplace but as a 
single point of entry for corporations which need to understand and cope with 
their duties in terms of climate change. The aim of the portal is to help 
companies establish what their position is and what they need to do now or in 
future. The site will also refer clients to consultants with a good track 
record in environmental and emissions issues.

Drummond said there are already sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide "emission 
reduction" markets in the US which have proved successful.

"Everyone anticipates that this market will be huge. People want to figure 
out what the issues are. When the legislation and the various regimes are 
established, reductions in emissions will have a real value," he said.

Fred Krupp of Environmental Defence, one of the leading environmental 
organisations in the US, said: "It is encouraging to see the emergence of 
carbon commerce entrepreneurs like CO2e.com who can build both the pathways 
and the incentive for market-based solutions to global warming."

at a staff meeting several weeks ago.  Attached please find a quick and dirty 
analysis of some of the key players.  You may note that Luminant is trading 
below $1.  Please let me know if anyone is actively pursuing this 
"intellectual capital" opportunity.

All the best,

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

Each of you have heard from either Mitch Taylor or myself regarding our 
concerns about the terms of our offers for new analysts.  I am forwarding 
this e-mail to each of you as further confirmation of the anecdotal evidence 
we have heard concerning how low our offers are as opposed to banks, 
consulting firms and even El Paso and Dynegy.  Steve and I have known each 
other since our undergraduate days and as you can tell from the attached he 
is a great Enron supporter on campus.  For everyone's information we have 
made 4 offers to Baylor undergrads and I will be surprised if we get any 
acceptances (one of the guys has already accepted with Chase for $20,000 more 
than our offer and told me that El Paso and Dynegy are both offering about 
$10,000 to $15,000 more than we are, not insignificant to an undergrad).  I 
am concerned that if we are low at Baylor (where we have concentrated on 
identifying the top 4 or 5 students) that the problem will be pervasive and 
our acceptance rate will be very low or only improved by students who didn't 
receive other offers (i.e. average performers).  

Thanks for your time.

Hey Bill,

I've been asking around about job offers for some of our top students.  I
haven't talked to everyone who has received Enron offers but I thought you
might want to know that for everyone I've talked to thus far, Enron is the
low offer....sometimes by a large gap.  I know that one person got offered
one and a half times what you offered by another firm (not an investment
banker!).  I have heard through my sources that you were disappointed last
year that no one from Baylor accepted one of your offers.  I am also very
interested in you guys getting some Baylor folks.  I consider Enron to be a
premium place for our folks to go...for several reasons....including the
high praise I hear from my former students who have gone to work there.

The folks I talked to here didn't seem like they even wanted me to mention
this to you....but I wanted to make sure you knew that you were really
underbidding for our folks.

By the way...the 4 offers that Enron made to Baylor people (that I know of)
were all to top quality folks...but I guess you knew that.

Also, I hear you were promoted yet again.  Congratulations.

Steve Rich

Jeff,

I enjoyed visiting with you, Lou, and Greg last week.
I haven't heard anything back, and so wanted to check
in to see if it's appropriate to schedule a follow up
phone call.  I am leaving for Europe on June 30 and
will be gone for 10 days, so hoped to hear something
before then.  Thanks.

Chad

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

Greg,

 I'm sure that Liz has alaredy informed you that I've called a couple
of times to speak with you.  My reason for calling is that I am currently
working on my applications for business school and as I'm sure you can
appreciate, recommendations are a very important part - since you attended
Stanford yourself.  I remember speaking with you about graduate school a
while back when I was in Houston, and the words "it's a crap shoot" still
stick in my head.  That's what you called the application process and I'll
never forget the quote.  As I plan to apply, I will most definitely see
first-hand how true these words are.

 In any event, I need three people with whom I have forged great
relationships with in my professional and academic career(s) who would be
able to write me a "first-class" recommendation.  I feel that you are
definitely one of these people.  I still hope that Enron would open an
extensive presence in New York; I would must rather be there.  I really
liked what I did; unfortunately it was just too far from home.

 I would really appreciate it if you would accept my request to write
a recommendation on my behalf.  I realize that you are probably very busy.
Although I'm sure you are willing to help me out in this regard, please
advise when I should forward the recommendation form(s).  Right now, I am
exclusively applying to Harvard for the January deadline, since it is really
where I would like to get my MBA.  The form basically consists of 6-10
questions (some are optional) that asks how well you know me (the
candidate), in what capacity you know/knew the candidate and what you think
about me.  Rather logical, right - after all it is a recommendation letter.
An electronic copy is attached to this e-mail that can be printed for your
reference.  Thanks again, Greg.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  My
contact information is attached below.  Please feel free to call me anytime
on the mobile phone - I mean this.

HELP STOP DEMOCRAT ELECTOR TAMPERING!

Al Gore is attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by any means 
necessary.  That includes tampering with the Electoral College itself.

Democrat operatives have begun clandestine background checks on Republican 
electors already certified from the 29 states George W. Bush won on November 
7.  They are looking for ways to persuade -- or intimidate -- Republican 
electors into changing their votes.

With Florida's 25 electoral votes, George W. Bush has a total of 271 
electoral votes.  (270 are needed to win.)  That means a shift of three would 
give Al Gore a majority -- and there are people in Gore's camp who seem to 
think private investigators can sway enough votes to win.

This is outrageous.  Already Al Gore has flooded Florida with lawyers, 
attempting to win in court what he lost at the ballot box.  He is pushing for 
partisan, rigged recounts in Democrat controlled counties.   He is demanding 
that Florida's election laws be junked so Democrat judges can impose a brand 
new, ad hoc system to accommodate the Democrats' frantic legal maneuvers.

Now the Gore camp is tampering with Electors.  Al Gore will do anything to 
win.  I've attached a Wall Street Journal report on the Democrats undercover 
assault on Republican electors.  Read it and draw your own conclusions.

This election should be OVER.  Because Al Gore refuses to accept the results, 
the fight continues.  The RNC is working to defend the integrity of the vote, 
not only in Florida but also in other close states like Oregon, Wisconsin  
and New Mexico as well.  We will fight this to the end, and we are confident 
we will prevail.  But we need your help.

We realize that we have asked a great deal from you in the past few days, but 
the future of our country may well be at stake.  We need to squelch this 
effort to steal Republican votes in the Electoral College in its infancy.

The Democrat Electoral College tampering is being led by Bob Beckel, who you 
may remember as Walter Mondale's campaign manager in 1984.  Below is Mr. 
Beckel's contact information.  Please contact him and express your outrage at 
his low handed tactics.

Fax: 703.841.1115

In addition, please do the following five things to help. Your efforts could 
help make the difference:

1) If you haven't done so already, take a minute to make a contribution to 
the RNC to help defend the integrity of the electoral process -- a process 
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won fairly on November 7 and which must not be 
overturned by Democrat dirty tricks now

If you'd rather give by check, follow this link to print out a form:
http://www.rncfc.org/econtributor/mailcheck2.htm

2) Call, e-mail and write your local elected officials, Democrats and 
Republicans. Let them know that this recent ploy by the Gore campaign is an 
outrageous attempt to undercut our Constitutional Democracy (you can get the 
addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of your elected Congress people 
and Senators at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/ )

3) Call your local talk radio show or TV news show and raise these issues.

4) Write a letter to the editor of your local, regional or national 
newspapers on these subjects.

5) Finally, send this e-mail on to your own e-mail list - to all of your 
friends and neighbors who are interested in knowing the truth about what is 
going on in Florida.

Follow this link to contribute immediately online, or rush the most generous 
contribution you can afford to the RNC today:

 (You can also print out a contribution form and mail your check in.)

The situation we face is unprecedented.  The presidency and the course of our 
nation for the next four years hang in the balance.  Your support is 
extremely important.  Please help as generously as you can.  Thank you.

Sincerely,


Jim Nicholson

Gore Resolves to Stay on the Offensive
As Democratic Aides Rally to His Cause
By GLENN R. SIMPSON, TOM HAMBURGER and LAURIE COHEN
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
(Beginning of article omited).
......One battle-tested Democratic consultant has even begun a quiet 
intelligence-gathering operation that could aid a last-ditch Gore strategy in 
the Electoral College. Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984 
Democratic presidential campaign and has close ties to Mr. Christopher, has 
been checking into the background of Republican electors, with an eye toward 
persuading a handful of them to vote for Mr. Gore. If Mr. Bush eventually 
prevails in Florida but wins none other of the most closely contested states, 
he would have 271 electoral votes. Three GOP defections could make Mr. Gore 
president.
"It is information gathering on my part, using my own network," Mr. Beckel 
said, confirming an operation he set in motion days after the Nov. 7 
election. "I call on mostly Democrats, but some Republicans, too, and ask. 
'Who are these electors, and what do you know about them?' I just wanted to 
know who these electors are."
Mr. Beckel, who owns a political-analysis business based in Arlington, Va., 
said he is working independently, "on an ad-hoc basis," and hasn't yet 
contacted any electors directly. "I wouldn't do that without first informing 
the Gore campaign," he said.

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour 
and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on 
where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test 
environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect 
it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that 
all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or 
provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to 
pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. 
They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his 
vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared 
and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. 
In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving 
money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why 
not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to 
participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back 
ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.
As I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to
contact him next week.

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The lender meetings in Singapore this week have been challenging.  The Indian 
banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a project with a 
repudiated PPA.  It is becoming more apparent to us that the Indian banks are 
being heavily influenced by the Government of India and not acting as 
commercial institutions.  Our business people do not believe that all or most 
foreign banks will continue funding at this point.  It is likely that the 
Indian banks could act on their own to cure the construction contract 
payments which give rise to termination this month (about $34 million).  
Within a few months, however, the Indian bank facility would be fully funded.

Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging MERC's 
jurisdiction.  While we have a hearing date scheduled on Monday, there is 
some doubt whether or not we will get a hearing on that date.

Bruce

The EES VaR for today is $15.6 million, up from $14.0 million yesterday, due 
to the additional short positions added at NP and SP in the Power West 
portfolio.  The VaR should decrease once the short positions associated with 
the University of California facilities are removed.

Greg -

Apollo is taking Pacer (our transportation logistics company) public through 
CSFB.  We're getting some interest in a sale as a result.  Given your 
expressed interest in the company, do you want Enron to get a look?  Let me 
know.

Here's the third party assessment of current western supply issues that we're 
most in agreement with. Sam Van Vactor's group publishes the daily Energy 
Market Report that's widely read, and Pickel is with Tabors Caramanis, 
consultants that we have employed on several issues.

Subject: Justice Department Investigation

Louise --

I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Justice Department has launched 
an investigation into the online electronic bond trading site set up by 
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Chase, and others.   The Justice Department 
said that they are studying the "competitive issues that arise from such 
close cooperation among competitors."

I will monitor this very closely, as I'm sure it will have implications for 
the likes of ICE.

Subject: Iraq Update
Sensitivity: Private

As expected, it looks like the US and UK have accepted the fact that the 
sanctions cannot be restructured before the June 3 deadline.  We still expect 
the UN to extend the oil-for-food program for six months, meaning little to 
no Iraqi disruptions in June.

However:  sources close to the UN report that Washington and London are still 
pushing hard for a shorter extension (1-2 months) of the program.  If they 
get their way on this issue, expect the Iraqis to say some bullish things in 
response (like they will not participate in the next phase of the 
oil-for-food program).  This might not be immediately bullish for WTI, but 
would set the stage for support as the market anticipates the end of the 
short extension a month or two down the road.

Iain,

First, thank you for being so helpful with me on the phone.  Below is the 
information you requested for the Whalley home fax machine.  I would love to 
meet w/you to discuss an updated fax machine for Greg's at home office.

The repair person can come any time tomorrow, Wednesday, 8/30.  However, a.m. 
works better for Mary Whalley.  Please give me a call when the rep. is

you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

ENE: Reiterate Buy; Believe Leadership Still Intact

* ENE has underperformed its peer group of Energy Merchants.  Stock
price down 39% from 52-week high ($90 on August 23) vs. peer group, up 1.9%.
* We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ENE's group-high P/E multiple and PEG ratio
of 27x and 1.3x, respectively (group average 19x and 1.0x), coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of Enron's business: bandwidth, India,
etc.
* Our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target, and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter.  India, while a
significant issue, remains a small part of Enron's asset base (about 4%).
It is a legacy business, in our view, and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company.
* We see ENE's business fundamentals intact, and in fact, improving.
Growth rate expansion to 25% from 20%; growing returns on capital; bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock -- justify premium valuation.

PentaSafe testing new security software

HOUSTON, Dec. 7 (LocalBusiness.com) -- PentaSafe Security Technologies Inc., 
which develops Internet security products, said testing begins this month for 
its newest software, which provides security for Web servers used in 
e-commerce. 
The Houston-based company's new software, VigilEnt Security Agent, is 
designed to protect information in the server from intrusion, loss and damage 
from both internal saboteurs and external hackers. It is expected to be 
available to the general market in the first quarter of 2001. 
The new product extends the company's current offerings, which protect 
operating systems, applications and databases. 
Steve Latham, vice president of strategic planning and development for 
PentaSafe, said the new software provides more than 100 system checks as 
online businesses prepare to move into production mode. It makes 
recommendations on how to secure identified risks and "lock-down" the secured 
system. Once the system is in operation, it continues to monitor and detect 
incidents. 
"It is important especially for companies that are in a hurry to test before 
they go into production," he said. "A lot of times they rush through to get 
things ready and make some mistakes in their application servers so that they 
are not secure." 
"It looks at 'is your system set up right?' and 'who has access?' as to who 
can make changes," Latham said. 
PentaSafe's new software locks down and secures the server, just as a 
homeowner secures the window and doors of his home "before the storm comes," 
he said. 
The new software is designed to work with BEA Systems Inc.'s (Nasdaq: BEAS) 
WebLogic Server 6.0, the latest release of BEA's Java application server. 
PentaSafe could potentially work with other vendors as well, Latham said.

Greg,

You bought 365 27-31 strangles and 1,000 28-30 strangles. Out of 1,000, I 
filled you 300 times internally at the same price that I was paying on the 
floor. I input this internal trade too late for it to get into your report. 
So you will see only 700 lots, the other 300 lots will show up on Friday. 
That means that you are about 33 contracts longer in July. Sorry about that.

Pavel, x34778

your punchbowl this morning.  When you can, give me a call or email me with 
details on how you'd like to settle, (and the response I'm looking for is not 
"Never.")  If I don't talk to you today, have a nice "overseas" Thanksgiving.

ILA: Initiating Coverage of a Pure-Play Energy Merchant

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Greg --

We have received a request to participate in Energy News Live, which is an 
energy news web site created by Williams, but acting independently of them.  
They are seeking the opportunity to interview traders from various companies 
live from their company's trading floor and they would like Enron to 
participate.  The discussion would be determined ahead of time and would not 
be proprietary, but rather market oriented.  They deliver the news every hour 
on the hour.

Mark Frevert suggested that I visit with you regarding our interest and/or 
set up a meeting between you and whoever you deem appropriate with the Energy 
News Live folks to discuss.  Please advise.

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=

With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=

Mercata's planned IPO highlights group buying trend 
update When it comes to getting the best deal on the Web, there's safety in 
numbers.

 latest must-have gadget or appliance by recruiting fellow Web consumers to 
buy in a group.

sparking fierce competition
 among companies scouting for their business.

   $4.7 billion in stock to become the largest seller of billing and customer

Gentlemen,

 I spoke to Ted Murphy today on the status of our limit and sector approval 
request and was told that I do not have your support.  I asked Ted if he 
thought this was a mistake and he replied that Mike was very direct.  In 
light of our meeting with Skilling and the feedback I got back, I'm not sure 
I understand your direction. 

  I essentially have no limits for the convertible arbitrage book as 
explained in the limit/sector proposal and will be forced to close the 
positions ( with out some form of relief ).  When we get Enron Metal's 
positions in currencies and rates added to my limit structure, I will have 
little room to engage in proprietary trading.  I need to redefine and expand 
the equity sectors and increase risk levels to maintain staff and generate 
the level of income we have planned in 2001.


Gary

On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian 
headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explore 
possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company in 
Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Houston 
representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently managed 
by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discuss other 
opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Houston this 
week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's Houston 
representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domestic US 
acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural gas 
markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron and 
Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business with 
Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's domestic or 
its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this 
unfamiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your 
review.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special 
thanks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel 
that should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please 
circulate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or 
could benefit from the materials.

                            Agenda - May 17th

2:00 - 3:00        Macro Discussion on US Domestic Gas Markets  -      Julie 
Gomez
3:00 - 3:30        Enron's Market Presence and Global Areas of Focus -  Greg 
Whalley
3:30 - 4:00 LNG Discussion 
-                                                      Les Webber, Kurt 
Lindahl
4:00 - 4:15        Trading Floor Tour
4:15 - 5:00        ECR Asset Discussion

The location for the meetings will be in conference room EB 3335.  Please 
give me a call if I can answer any questions.
Thanks for your help,
Scott Josey

Liz - I'm not sure if Greg pulls his own cc:Mail?  If not please print off 
the attached and give to him.  JP Morgan research dated November 6th - has an 
excellent discussion of Enron Net Works and a new 12-month target price on 
the stock of $130.00 / share.  I ran in to him on the elevator and told him I 
would forward a copy of it.

11/10 09:26 NYMEX needs e-trade partner, says ex-chairman Marks 

NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange needs a Web 
partner to ensure it capitalizes on its assets and becomes competitive in the 
Internet era of electronic futures trade, former NYMEX chairman Michel Marks 
said.  NYMEX, the world's largest physical commodity exchange, is due to 
launch enymex, its e-commerce venture for trading and clearing standardized 
physical commodity contracts, in early 2001.  But this solo approach may not 
be the most expedient path, Marks said in an exclusive interview at his Red 
Bank, New Jersey. residence.  "NYMEX has a lot of assets," Marks told 
Reuters. "They have risk capital from the floor, systems, staffing, clearing, 
a brand name. In my opinion, they need to partner through a transition 
phase."  The challenge for the NYMEX, as for any exchange, is to re-engineer 
itself in the face of vested interests and an ingrained tradition of open 
outcry trading.  "It takes leadership and a vision to re-engineer those 
assets," Marks said.  Futures in crude oil, natural gas, electricity, 
propane, gold, silver platinum, palladium, copper and aluminum are traded at 
the exchange's NYMEX and COMEX divisions.  With the many seats he owns, Marks 
still has a significant vested interest in the health and future of the 
exchanges and in ensuring they do not become obsolete as electronic trading 
transforms the global marketplace.  "What's the difference between AT&T and 
NYMEX? Xerox?" he asked. "All these businesses are sunset industries."  
Although Marks retired from the floor in 1987, he leases out his and his 
family's many seats and closely follows the industry. After leaving the 
floor, he eventually started what he called a "pre-Internet venture."  "It 
was a Web site for the futures industry," he said. "I spent three years in it 
and I realized that no one would ever, ever make any money at it."  Like all 
successful traders, Marks took his losses and got out quickly.  "I understand 
the electronic world and the pit," he said.

After becoming acting chairman in late 1977 at age 28 in what he called "a 
quirk of fate" when the chairman at the time had a heart attack, Marks 
relaunched NYMEX's heating oil and residual oil contracts with a New York 
harbor delivery and made over the management of the exchange, turning it into 
a very successful, global marketplace.  Recently he has been researching the 
various front-end systems that were created by companies like Trading 
Technologies and are at the cutting edge of electronic trade.  "Business is 
moving to EnronOnline, HoustonStreet and ICE, and there are another 
dozen-plus energy-only electronic exchanges out there already," said Marks, 
referring to the host of business-to-business (B2B) exchanges to trade power, 
crude oil and natural gas.

The Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, started live Internet trading of 
energy products on Oct 12. The Atlanta-based exchange is a partnership of 
seven major banks and oil companies.  EnronOnline was established last 
November by Houston-based Enron <ENE.N>, North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of natural gas and electricity.  HoustonStreetExchange of Portsmouth, 
New Hampshire, is the first fully web-based trading portal and a 
majority-owned subsidiary of BayCorp Holdings, Ltd. <MWH.A>.

Marks said the market will make a pragmatic choice about whether to move to 
electronic exchanges, continue to trade open outcry, or a use a side-by-side 
combination based on how easily business can get done.  "The fact of the 
matter is, the most important thing is liquidity," he said. "Performance 
counts."

Computerworld Honors Acta Technology in Annual 'Top 100 Emerging Companies to 
Watch'; Industry Publication Recognizes Leader in B2B Data Integration
? 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 4, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, has been selected 
as one of Computerworld's "Top 100 Emerging Companies to Watch," the 
magazine's annual review of new leaders in high technology. The magazine has 
selected Acta as a winner in the highly-competitive eCommerce category, which 
includes other leading B2B software companies such as Blue Martini (Nasdaq: 
BLUE), Saga Software (NYSE: AGS), and Ventro (Nasdaq: VNTR). 
"We are honored to be included in this year's list of emerging companies," 
said Acta CEO Carol Mills Baldwin. "B2B data integration is emerging as a 
must-have technology for businesses around the globe. Recognition for this 
technology in Computerworld is further validation of the category we have 
created." 
B2B data integration resolves one of the principle issues in eBusiness today: 
that back-office systems were not designed to meet the data demands of B2B 
eCommerce and analytic solutions. Those demands include speed, scalability, 
and access to both the real-time and historical data locked away in multiple 
back-office systems. By staging real-time and historical data from multiple 
systems in data caches, the Acta eCommerce Data Platform allows companies to 
deliver the data that is needed, when it is needed, both inside and outside 
the enterprise. 
Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B (cumulative) 
by 2005-driven by the need to provide information-rich data to partners, 
suppliers and customers for collaborative computing. 
With over 160 customers worldwide, Acta is well-poised to continue leading 
the growing B2B data integration market. In the past year, Acta has also won 
honors from Upside Magazine (Hot 100 private companies), DM Review (Winner, 
World Class Solutions) eWeek (Best Practices Award-B2B Category, Finalist), 
and Intelligent Enterprise (RealWare Awards-B2B Category, Finalist).

ENW VENTURES PORTFOLIO NEWS

Acta's New B2B Data Server Now Available for Multiple Operating Platforms; 
ActaWorks 4.4 Significantly Expands Support for Industry-Leading Data 
Integration Solutions

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., the leader 
in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, announced today the general 
availability of ActaWorks 4.4, the latest version of its award winning 
enterprise data server. ActaWorks 4.4 provides recent product and performance 
enhancements that previously were available only for Windows NT (under 
ActaWorks 4.3). Acta made the announcement at the eBusiness Conference and 
Expo in New York City. 
The new product significantly expands support for the industry-leading 
provider of B2B data integration. With ActaWorks 4.4, businesses with Windows 
NT, Windows 2000, and Unix environments (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX) can 
all employ Acta's new enhancements for packaging and delivering the data 
essential for B2B eCommerce and business intelligence. 
Among the new features is a repository architecture that enables centralized 
metadata management and multi-user development. As businesses implement a 
data platform to support both internal and external access to enterprise 
data, the need to manage metadata from external and internal sources becomes 
critical -- and the need for multiple users increases. 
The addition of these new enhancements further solidifies Acta's leadership 
position in B2B data integration, a rapidly emerging component of B2B

Trade-Ranger integrates multiple buying programs

HOUSTON, Dec. 13 -- Trade-Ranger, an Internet marketplace for the procurement 
of supplies by the energy industry, has integrated another type of software 
into its site to eliminate barriers to its customers and to help build 
liquidity. 
Allen May, interim co-CEO, told LocalBusiness.com the site has added another 
buying tool, iPlanet BuyerXpert software, at the request of one of its 
founding partners. Trade-Ranger already had Oracle Corp.'s iProcurement and 
Commerce One's e-procurement programs. 
"Our members are transacting, we have integrated multiple buying tools to the 
Commerce One platform, and we are continuing our effort to build the most 
efficient content hub in the industry," May said. 
"We will adopt the best-of-breed technology," he said. 
Houston-based Trade-Ranger was incorporated in August. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) 
is based in Redwood City, Calif., while Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) is based 
in Pleasanton, Calif. Meanwhile, iPlanet is a product of iPlanet E-Commerce 
Solutions, a Sun-Netscape Alliance. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is based 
in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Trade-Ranger is building its membership, and no numbers were immediately 
available, May said. 
Technology can be a barrier to liquidity growth, May said. Some marketplaces 
simply tell customers they must adopt that marketplace's technology, he said. 
"We definitely have an open policy," May said. 
He added that Trade-Ranger has made a significant investment in technology, 
although he was unwilling to disclose the amount spent. 
Formerly the Energy and Petrochemical Exchange, the Houston-based exchange 
announced its formation on April 11. The exchange describes itself as 
"created by the industry for the industry." 
Membership is available to all companies, buyers and sellers, in the 
upstream, downstream, retail and petrochemical sectors. Upstream refers to 
oil and gas producers, while downstream refers to the refining section of the 
business. 
The original 14 founding partners are Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, TotalFinaElf, 
The Dow Chemical Co., Conoco Inc., Motiva Enterprises, Occidental Petroleum, 
Equilon Enterprises, Phillips Petroleum, Mitsubishi Corp., Repsol, YPF, 
Statoil, Unocal and Tosco. 
The collective annual purchasing budgets of the founding partners exceeds 
$125 billion worldwide.

GM, Ford take $1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One software company

12/12/2000 
The Canadian Press 
Copyright (c) 2000 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. 
DETROIT (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will take a combined 
$1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One, making the business-to-business 
software company a technology partner in the automakers' Covisint online 
exchange. 
Pleasanton, Calif.-based Commerce One said it will issue to GM and Ford 14.4 
million shares apiece, with each stake valued at about $631.8 million, based 
on Commerce One's close Tuesday of $43.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The 
combined number of shares represents a 14 per cent interest in Commerce One. 
Half the shares for each company will be held in escrow until 2002, and will 
be released to Ford and GM upon satisfaction of certain conditions. If 
conditions are not met, the shares will be released to the two automakers in 
mid-2004. 
Commerce One said it will undergo a corporate restructuring into a holding 
company and get a two per cent equity interest in Covisint, the Internet 
exchange started by Ford, GM and three other automakers. Covisint 
incorporated for business Monday. 
Commerce One's stake in Covisint will be held in escrow until the completion 
of the restructuring, on which Commerce One shareholders are to vote next 
year. 
Commerce One will be entitled to a share of the revenue generated by the 
Covisint exchange for an expected 10-year term, as well as be paid for 
consulting services it provides to Covisint. 
``We look forward to continuing our efforts with Covisint to deliver a global 
e-marketplace platform for the automotive industry,'' Mark Hoffman, Commerce 
One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``Covisint is an 
excellent example of Commerce One's business model and reflects our 
commitment to moving the world's business commerce onto the Web.'' 
In addition to Ford and GM, Covisint's backers include DaimlerChrysler AG, 
Nissan and Renault, as well as Commerce One and fellow software firm Oracle. 
Covisint is supposed to act as an Internet marketplace for the auto industry, 
allowing suppliers and automakers to swap information and conduct business 
far more quickly and cheaply than they have in the past. 
Detroit's automakers have said Covisint should be able to route their 
purchases of $250 billion a year in goods and services. 
Covisint said it has more than 250 customers on two continents already using 
its services, including catalogues, auctions, quote management and 
collaborative design.

Mr. Lay,

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

Regards,

Kevin

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 
128X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric 
Generators.  We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.

We are available to address questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Thanks very much to Enron for the card and gift.  I made my donation to the 
Boys & Girls Club of the Columbia Area because my wife has served as a 
director of this organization since its inception about 5 years ago.  Thanks 
again, and happy holidays to Ken Lay and colleagues at Enron.

I have received several calls this morning regarding the above, so apparently 
there is some doubt.  Please be advised that the executive committee will not 
meet today.  Further, due to travel schedules and the holidays, executive 
committee meetings will not be held on Monday, December 18 or Monday, 
December 25.  

Please make note that the next executive committee meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, January 2, 2001at 11:00 a.m. in EB50 Boardroom.

Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Regards and Happy Holidays!

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Dynetek, which develops, manufactures, and markets lightweight fuel
storage systems, announced that its newest fuel storage system (5000 psi)
would increase the range of fuel cell vehicles by over 30% relative to
current designs.
* California Governor Gray Davis signed a bill in late September
creating incentives for the purchase or lease of new zero emission vehicles
(ZEV).  While the details of the program are to be proposed on December 7th
and 8th in Sacremento, individual grants of up to $9,000 over three years
($3,000 per year) may be offered to consumers, both private and public, who
purchase or lease ZEVs.
* Innogy Technology Ventures received approval from the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) to build a regenerative fuel cell power plant in
Mississippi using the company's Regenesys technology.  A regenerative fuel
cell stores and releases electrical energy through a reversible
electrochemical reaction using two salt electrolytes.

Introducing the Power Curve II
The November Forward Price Curve (updated from our September analysis)
Introducing the Spark Spread
Comparing the Energy Merchants

Summary of key points:

* Power prices have growth tighter since our September analysis; 2001
forward prices are higher in every region by an average of 5%.
* The national average forward price is 23% higher in 2001 than in
2000.
* We introduce the spark spread in this report.  We expect a slightly
wider power/gas spread in 2001, although natural gas prices continue to
climb to record levels. This is bullish for generators.
* Generators are off 29% from summertime peaks; we suggest
accumulating prior to next summer.  We highlight Calpine, NRG Energy, and
Southern Energy.
* We also recommend energy merchants, whose strong trading skills
offer protection in any commodity pricing environment.  We recommend Enron,
Dynegy, and Duke Energy.  (See our Merchant Matrix on page 7.)

Dear Mr. Vice Chairman,

As a new Executive Committee member I am writing to inquire as to any 
additional compensation that I may be due in light of my increased level of 
responsibility.  Does this change the company's position regarding my 
previous e-mail related to the vesting of my restricted stock?

Regards,

Jim

GET DAD SOMETHING HE'LL REALLY USE IN THE TEXANS ONLINE STORE!

big guy. So what better way to express your gratitude and love than with a
gift from his favorite team?

MEMORIES
"My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful."
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father

"My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is
football. Anybody who overhears our conversations must think we're nuts. I'm
looking forward to the Texans playing next year, so my dad and I can start
going to a couple of Texans games a year at Reliant."
-- Posted in the Texans message boards by Columbia

Have a memory you'd like to share about your own dad? Then log on and post
it in the message boards!

I understand that due to Greg not responding to your requests, Net Works has 
been removed from the PRC process for Analyst/Associates this year.

Although I understand that reassigning people is out of the question - I 
would like someone present from Net Works to ensure fair representation.  I 
do understand that Analyts and Associates are not represented by their 
management but we do know that there is usually someone else from their group 
present in the room to offer guidance should there be any issues.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Thanks

Louise

o Report: Crosspoint Forgoes $1 Billion New Fund

NEW YORK -- Crosspoint Venture Partners has commitments
for a new $1 billion fund but has decided not to
raise the capital, according to a report in the
Wall Street Journal. The reason for the delay is
the difficult environment for investing in new companies
and generating high returns. Crosspoint will raise
the fund as soon as the environment improves, according
to the report. Crosspoint raised an $850 million
fund earlier this year.

EnergyWorkspace in alliance with VerticalNet
HOUSTON, Nov. 29 (LocalBusiness.com) -- EnergyWorkspace, a developer of 
online business software for the oil and gas industry, has formed an alliance 
with a huge Pennsylvania business-to-business company to co-brand their 
products. 
EnergyWorkspace said the deal with VerticalNet Markets, a unit of VerticalNet 
Inc. (Nasdaq: VERT), of Horsham, Pa., will give its users greater information 
reach through that company's two energy portals. 
VerticalNet operates 55 industry-specific online communities, including one 
for oil and gas interests and another for the hydrocarbon industry. 
Mark Beatty, president and chief executive officer of Houston-based 
EnergyWorkspace, said in a release the alliance will aid his customers and it 
also will "introduce our unique business process support system to thousands 
of potential clients across a range of energy companies." 
Both companies commented on how well the two fit each other's needs, stopping 
just short of mentioning a possible merger. Jerry Alwais, a spokesman for 
EnergyWorkspace, told LocalBusiness.com that he does not know terms of the 
deal and has not heard anything about a merger. Officials at each company 
were not available for futher comment. 
The once high-flying VerticalNet, whose stock traded as high as $148.38 last 
spring, opened today at a 52-week low of $10.50. 
Joseph Galli, chief executive officer and president of VerticalNet, earlier 
said his company was looking to make strategic acquisitions. He made the 
announcement at the same time the company said it lost a whopping $121.9 
million through the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 
$38.2 million for the period a year earlier. 
Since EnergyWorkspace is privately held, it doesn't report on its financial 
picture.

As many of you are aware, over the last few weeks the Kiodex transaction has 
changed such that it no longer includes the sale of EnergyDesk.   The new 
transaction structure is limited to the Kiodex/EOL Strategic Relationship and 
performance warrants.  Attached is the final version of the non-binding 
Kiodex LOI which was signed November 21, 2000.  Our goal is to finalize the 
documents and close by year end.  If anyone has any questions or comments 
please feel free to give me a call at the numbers listed below.  Thank you.

Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating 
an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of 
electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is 
requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states 
that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our 
offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make 
sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will 
get back to you asap with further information.

Summary

-Yesterday's hearing confirmed imminent death of SoCal MOU
-Plan(s) B also drew little support; state "trust" for generators unlikely
-QF/SoCal negotiations are "treading water" as SoCal runs out the clock; 
tries to postpone involuntary filing
-BK court unlikely to view SoCal payments to QFs as preferential because of 
state order

Report

1. Few Signs of Legislative Support for SoCal MOU

Sources report that Bryson is in regular contact with many legislators,
but especially with Hertzberg and Keeley on the Assembly side (from which
the Plan B is being directed) and Bowen (Senate Energy Chairperson) on the
Assembly side.  Sources believe that Bryson's comment may about the
legislature 'warming up to the MOU' may be a smokescreen; Democratic Senator
Alarcon said in the MOU hearing yesterday that the MOU is dead and is not
going to pass.  Reportedly no one attempted to contradict him.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce, large energy users,  TURN, the California 
Manufacturers' and Technology Association (CMTA) and  others also spoke out 
against the MOU.  (Sources found it remarkable that  TURN and the CMTA, who 
have been rivals in Plan B negotiations, agreed with each  other in strongly 
attacking the MOU.

2. Plan(s) B Are Still Foundering

 The Plan(s) B were not discussed at the hearing, though some of the same
issues came up.  For instance, it was discussed whether it was possible to
transfer all of Edison's obligations to a trust that pays out after the
conclusion of litigation.  In the opinion of the governor's counsel and
other lawyers present, this is "shaky," especially without the consent of
creditors.  In their opinion, there would have to be an agreement that would
pay off everything.

The governor's counsel stated there were constitutional problems with setting 
up a trust for what the generators are owed, then letting them litigate over 
the trust.  Also, he stated that it was not feasible for the state to be 
offering generators cash on the one hand while the FERC negotiated with them 
to refund the state for power
purchases (as ordered in the FERC decision Monday).  The governor's counsel
stated that the only reasonable thing for the state to do was to give the
generators their cash, then sue them for it.

3. QF/SoCal Negotiations Are "Treading Water"

 QF sources suggest that the debate between SoCal and the PUC as to whether
the QFs should be paid 10% or 15% of what they are owed is "not a real
question," but rather a stalling measure allowing SoCal to hold on to cash
in advance of a filing or a global solution.  "SoCal is just treading water," 
said a source.


4. SoCal Payments to QFs Unlikely to be Viewed As Preference  Payments

Sources also comment that SoCal payments to the QFs likely would not be
seen as a preference payment in bankruptcy court because they were ordered
by a state agency, the PUC.  However, comments made in the SoCal conference
call yesterday seem to indicate that Solomon Smith and perhaps other
creditors may see the payments this way and may be willing to sign a
bankruptcy petition.

Subject: Crisis in Enron Japan

Dear top management,

I know how dangerous if I use my real name so please forgive me to
use this free email.
I studied Enron for a long time before there is a branch in Tokyo.
How glad when I received the offer from Enron Japan! I believe my life must
have been changed to a new chapter.

But now... I'm so disppointed with enron Japan's poor management.
We local staff think Joe and other "experts" are too young to manage
this company. Forgive my impolite, EJ is really like a kindergarden!

In order not to waste your time,I conclude some points here:

1. Joe's poor management not only makes everything confused but also
makes local staff fears. He is so cold and imprudent that Japanese is
difficult to communicate with him. I know he is from Harvard,but that
doesn't
mean he is human,he is sensitive.

2. It's very obvious that Joe conflicted with Jonathan and now we don't
think he works well with Jeremy. We want to know why you top management
always make such kind of combination. Joe only trusts the people he worked
together in Norway and Australia. He has strong discrimination with Jonathan
and Jeremy's people,also has strong discimination with local staff.

3. Enron Metal is in the same office with us but like a completely different
company. No any communication between Enron Japan and Enron metal.The same
situation can be seen with E-power.Japanese mass media are suprised why
Enron
set up two companies in Japan. E-power is enough!!! Look at GE, why they
succeed
the business in Asia. They make joint venture company first. Until they are
convinced they can succeed, they open branch. Learn from GE!

4. The experts from overseas countries are really cheeky,they are not modest
to hear local staff's opinions but just push their methods to us. We can't
see any
democracy in this company!! If you want to succed your business,you should
also
hear some opposite ideas.You shouldn't alianate the people who say different
things! We don't need young associate! Let them go home!!

5. We don't need young experts because Japanese clients won't do business
if the counterparty is too young. All of the young experts should go home.
They are wasting enron's money!! To send young experts here doesn't match
Japanese culture.


All of these are true. I love Enron and want to see Enron Japan become a
comfortable and profitable place to work.

Thanks&regards
Sato

		 Subject: Dabhol Status

Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay

Dear Friends:

On Tuesday night, Republican Randy Forbes was elected to represent one of the 
most competitive, Democratic-leaning districts in America:  Virginia's 4th 
Congressional District.  President Clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 
1996, and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 
(even while they won statewide).

Despite the tough odds, Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the 
strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of 
President Bush.  While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative 
campaigning, Forbes won the district by more than 5,000 votes.

The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush.  Democrats 
were desperate to win, but Republicans won another victory in a swing 
district.

To give you a bit of historical perspective, there have been 78 special 
elections over the past 25 years.  Only 19 of those special elections 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and only three of 
those 19 swung toward the party of the President.  Historical odds were not 
in his favor, but Representative-elect Forbes defied the odds.

So what does this history-defying Republican victory mean to us on a national 
level?  The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide 
momentum across the political spectrum for President Bush's agenda for 
America.

And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum.  You helped 
President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldn't be 
done - a bipartisan $1.35 trillion tax relief package.  The first round of 
tax relief checks was mailed yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate your 
helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve.

If President Bush is to succeed in improving our schools, rebuilding our 
military, saving Social Security and Medicare and ushering in the 
responsibility era, he will need your continued help and involvement.

President Bush is counting on all of us to become his Team Leaders.  Learn 
more about this unique opportunity to spread the President's message and help 
retain and increase our majorities in 2002 by visiting 
http://www.gopteamleader.com.

Again, thank you for your continued efforts.  Without you, odds are we 
wouldn't have been able to win in Virginia.

Very truly yours,


Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Background on VA-04 Special Election
June 20, 2001

Upset in Virginia Special Election

A Victory for White House & National GOP

Republican Team Pulls Together, Victory a Model for
'01 and '02 Elections

-- Last night, Randy Forbes was elected to represent Virginia's 4th district, 
receiving 52.1% (70,926 votes) to Democrat Louise Lucas' 47.9% (65,189 
votes).  This election is a swing district-President Clinton won the district 
by 1% in 1992 and 7% in 1996, while President Bush won the district by less 
than 1,000 votes.

--  In the past 25 years, there have been 78 special elections.  Only 19 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and of the 19, 
only 3 swung toward the party of the President.  Now 4.

--  President Bill Clinton pre-recorded thousands of turnout calls for this 
special election.

-- The voters embraced the President's policies.

-- Most importantly the President's policies were embraced in a moderate 
swing district drawn by Democrats, further evidence that President Bush is 
addressing the issues that affect and unite everyone.

-- Randy Forbes ran on the programs, policies and momentum of President Bush. 
Randy ran on moving the President's policies forward and now the results are 
in and the outcome is clear.

-- Media pundits recognized that this would be a referendum on the President.

Bob Novak, of The Chicago Sun-Times: "A mailing came out from the Democratic 
candidates...saying...there's no doubt who the Bush Republican will help, who 
it will hurt -- six million minority families and 12 million children will be 
left behind."  (CNN's "Inside Politics," 06/07/01)

Mark Shields: "Larry, is this Virginia race really an early referendum on 
President George W. Bush?" U.Va. Professor Larry Sabato: "To a certain agree 
I think it is."  (CNN?s "Capital Gang," 06/16/01)

"Numerous national analysts called the [special election] a test of the two 
parties' strengths and a possible bellwether for the fight for control of the 
House of Representatives in 2002.  Some of the national cachet surrounding 
the contest comes from its status as the first congressional election since 
Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' defection from the GOP switched control of 
the Senate?"  (Tyler Whitley, "Lucas, Forbes Push Turnout," The Richmond 
Times-Dispatch, 06/19/01)

"...a contest that's being widely viewed as an early indicator of voter 
attitudes toward Bush and his policies.  The result, said Stuart Rothenberg, 
an independent analyst of congressional campaigns, is that the race looms as 
'a sort of referendum on George W. Bush, on the energy issue, on Social 
Security and on the direction of the country.'  Indeed, Rothenberg and others 
will review the outcome as a possible harbinger for the 2002 midterm 
elections."  (Robert L. Jackson, "Va. House Race May Show GOP What It Faces 
In '02," Los Angeles Times, 06/17/01)

"National politicians view the toss-up race in Virginia's 4th District not 
only as a possible referendum on the Bush administration but also as a 
bellwether race that will determine which party has the momentum heading into 
the 2002 elections."  (Allison Stevens, "Polls See Virginia Race As Preview 
Of Battle For The House In 2002," The Hill, 06/13/01)

Bob Edwards: "The election is being portrayed as a referendum on the Bush 
administration."  (NPR's "Morning Edition," 06/13/01)

Fred Barnes: "This election in the fourth district of Virginia is the Vieques 
of elections.  It's the testing ground for this Social Security issue.  And 
if the Democrat, who is an African- American woman named Louise Lucas, if she 
wins, Democrats are going to rightly conclude, this Social Security issue is 
dynamite, and we can attack Bush's partial privatization bill."  (Fox's "Fox 
News Sunday," 06/17/01)

"Political analysts said the race would be viewed as an early referendum on 
the Bush administration and as a bellwether for next year's midterm 
elections."  (Larry O'Dell, "State Senators Compete For Open Seat In 
Congress," The Associated Press, 06/19/01)

"[T]oday's by-election in Virginia's Fourth District has become a referendum 
on Mr. Bush's first five months. If the Democrats win, they will argue that 
Mr. Bush has once again been rejected and that they have the momentum for 
next year's crucial mid-term elections."  (Damian Whitworth, "Battle Flares 
As Virginia Poll Puts Bush To Test," The London Times, 06/19/01)

Events:

-- GOP Unity, May 10: White House Political Director Ken Mehlman spoke at the 
Chesterfield GOP Unity dinner on May 10.  Chesterfield County was Forbes' 
primary opponents strongest county.

-- Fundraising, June 4: Vice President Cheney spoke at a fundraiser in 
Chesapeake where nearly $100,000 was contributed to the Forbes campaign.

-- Education, June 12: Forbes participated in an inner-city school event in

education.

-- Sportsmen, June 14: Former NASCAR superstar and current FOX racing analyst 
Darrell Waltrip visited a Forbes for Congress picnic, garnering media 
coverage both on the front page and the sports pages of local newspapers.

Grassroots Activity:

-- Mail: President Bush signed his name to an absentee ballot mail piece that 
garnered more than 2,000 responses.  Bob Dole signed a letter that went to 
55,000 veterans and their families.

-- Phones: Over 66,000 phone calls were made with a message from President 
Bush.  45,000 phone calls were made to seniors with a message from Barbara 
Bush.

-- State Parties: 42 GOP State Parties contributed money to the Forbes 
campaign, with the majority of parties sending $5,000, the maximum allowed, 
raising a total of $230,000.

-- Members of Congress: Approximately 130 Members of Congress contributed 
money to the Forbes Campaign, including dozens of leadership PACs.

Other Activities:

-- Veterans, May 19: Secretary Principi attended a Veterans event on May 19 
to reach out to the 150,000 servicemen, former servicemen, and military 
families in the district.

o Ventro shutting down two b-to-b marketplaces

Ventro (VNTR) is shutting down its two wholly owned b-to-b marketplaces -- 
Chemdex and Promedix-- after efforts to find buyers failed, the company 
disclosed today.  The beleaguered operator of online marketplaces, which had 
previously disclosed efforts to sell Chemdex and Promedix as part of a 
broader corporate restructuring, said today that those efforts had failed, 
forcing today's actions. The shutdowns will begin Dec. 31 and will force 
Ventro to fire about 235 workers. The company expects to record aggregate 
restructuring charges of about $380 million to $410 million in its fiscal 
year-end results in connection with the closures. Ventro shares were trading 
up 62 cents to $2.50 in midday trading today.  Chemdex operates an online 
marketplace for the life sciences industry, while Promedix is a marketplace 
focused on high-end medical equipment. Over the past six months, Ventro has 
struggled to convince buyers and sellers to conduct business through these 
marketplaces, leading to disappointing financial results and a steep drop in 
the company's stock price. In October, Ventro CEO Dave Perry announced plans 
for a major restructuring, which would involve selling off stakes in the 
company's marketplaces, and transform the company into a provider of services 
for b-to-b marketplaces.  But sources familiar with Ventro's restructuring 
plans say efforts to sell Chemdex and Promedix fell on deaf ears from 
potential suitors because the company could not overcome two big hurdles. 
First, potential buyers were turned off by the poor performance of the two 
marketplaces. Second, and more importantly, Ventro was pushing unattractive 
sale terms, sources say, including a requirement that any marketplace buyer 
enter into a long-term services contract with Ventro estimated to be worth 
between $10 million and $20 million a year. "This was a big hurdle for 
buyers," a source familiar with the Ventro's sale efforts said. "No one 
wanted to pay for the marketplaces, then be forced to hire Ventro to run 
them."  Ventro executives are holding a conference call later today to 
discuss this announcement; it is expected that executives will push the 
positive of the shutdowns. Ventro says that future cash outlays for operating 
activities will be reduced by 50 percent after Chemdex and Promedix are 
shuttered, which should put Ventro on a stronger financial footing as it 
struggles to survive.

McDonald's Acquires Failed Web Firms, Sends Employees to Burger U.

(Oak Brook, IL) Fast food giant, McDonald's has entered the dot-com
world with a big splash, acquiring failed web firms at a breakneck pace.
 Not an ordinary technology investor, McDonald's is taking a corporate
raiding approach to these acquisitions.  Instead of utilizing acquired
firms to increase the corporation's Internet presence, McDonald's is
taking a new spin on the increasingly popular "Vulture Capital" role,
selling off patents and equipment, while retraining the acquired
staff.

"Getting employees that can make correct change and process orders
properly is much more difficult than one might imagine," McDonald's
spokesman Harrison Dent explained.  "There's also the issue of
convincing qualified teenagers that McDonald's is a cool place to work.
It all makes staffing very difficult for us.  We've found that most web
programmers have sufficient mathematical skill to make correct change,
as well as handle the digital read-outs on microwaves and French Fry
machines.   With the economic problems many web firms have been having,
compared with the cost of constantly recruiting new teenagers and
replacing them as they go off to college, it has become economical to
simply acquire a struggling web firm, sell-off whatever assets they
have, and send their staff to Burger U. for retraining in the business
of family dining."

Dent went on to say that the various positions at web firms mapped out
well with McDonald's staffing matrix.  Programmers, being mathematically
inclined, would process the customer orders and make correct change.
Quality assurance workers are sent back to the kitchen, making sure each
burger they flip is up to corporate standards.  Technical support makes
sure the grills and fryers stay in working order and that the floors are
clean.  Managers continue to manage and accountants still do the
books.

"Initially there were concerns that, due to the large number of foreign
programmers, that there might be some language problems with these
workers taking orders.  However, upon execution, it was found that the
problems with poor English skills were no greater than those currently
existing in our Chicago operations."

McDonald's largest problems in converting employees seem to be dress
code and unauthorized snacking.

"Unfortunately, the casual dress codes allowed at some of these firms
have caused a culture clash," Dent elucidated.  "We have had some issues
with employees showing up to work in dirty t-shirts, rather than in a
McDonald's uniform.  Similarly, many of the acquired firms provided free
and unlimited snacks and drinks, a policy which is not a staple of our
organization."

Still, Dent was upbeat about the prospects of transitioning the digital
economy to the burger economy.

Brain Dead
The Next P2P
By The Big Head

In the battle of acronyms, the first P2P was path-to-profitability.
Then we had P2P as in peer-to-peer.  Though no one really knows if this
is Napster type P2P (central server based) or the SETI type P2P
(distributed computing).  Regardless, the next P2P will be
Private-to-Public, as in private-to-public exchanges.

The beginning of the B2B revolution was led by public "exchanges".
While the exchanges were nothing of the sort when one used to think of
true exchanges (Commodities, Futures, NASDAQ, NYSE), they did expose the
public to the Internet space.

These "exchanges" as they were called were really nothing more than
glorified auctions.  There was no exchanging going on because that is
not what they were designed to do.  The idea of these early companies
was to build a technology and then leverage the power of the Internet to
create buying communities.  Whether it was buyers or sellers, the
premise was the same.

If the company chose to work on sell side mechanics, then it was usually
excess inventory of some sort put out into a platform where the highest
bidder was the winner.
Conceptually, this was a good idea.

However, it was fraught with a few challenges.  First, you needed lots
of buyers to attract the sellers, and vice versa, thus liquidity was an
issue.

Second, none of these technologies took into account a payment mechanism
or payment platform, thus all settlement issues were handled offline.
While this may have been fine in modern times, the premise of the
Internet was to help eliminate such paper and time-based
inefficiencies.

If the company chose to work on buy side mechanics, then a buyer would
list his request and suppliers could jump at the chance to bid for the
opportunity.  This, as well, brought about it's own set of challenges.

Namely, the suppliers, who were necessary for the validity of the
auction, stayed away.  The figured it out pretty quickly that they would
only be bidding against themselves and their own margins.  Thus without
enough suppliers, you had no liquidity.

Where is the industry now?  On the "Private Exchange" model.  What the
industry failed to take into account was the value of RELATIONSHIPS.

The relationship between buyers and sellers is a long term and trusted
item.  Some relationships go back a hundred years.  Take Ford and
Firestone for instance.  That relationship has been in existence since
the dawn of the automobile.

You don't just build a technology and expect to steal those existing
bonds away overnight.  Therefore, the premise of the public exchange is
to leverage the existing relationship between the buyers and sellers of
companies, industries and verticals.

The companies are saying, give me a better way to deal with my own
suppliers.  I trust these companies, I know them, I know their pricing,
and their deliverables, heck, I play golf with their CFO.  I want to
keep them.

However, I want to do it more efficiently.  What can technology and the
web do to make my life easier in dealing with the known quantities that
exist within my own company realm?

So now, the push is to private exchanges.  A way to take big companies
with hundreds or thousands of existing relationships and bring them to
the web.  This creates immediate liquidity among groups of companies
used to doing business with each other.

That makes sense and should be where the market focus was all along.
What will the evolution of this be?  That is where the new P2P comes
in.

What is P2P, you ask?  Private-to-Public exchanges.

While a private exchange focuses on existing customers, a public
exchange holds the promise of more buyers and sellers.  Thus, more
liquidity creates potentially more sales or more savings.

Ask yourself, "If I were a company would I be interested in new buyers
and sellers for my goods?"  Invariably, the answer is yes.  A private
exchange automates my existing relationships.  However, find a way to
provide me access to more buyers and sellers as well, and know you
really have my attention.

Where is the future of exchanges?  It should move toward a
private-to-public marketplace.

First, make it easier to deal with my existing customer and supplier
base.
Second, give me more buyers and sellers for my goods.

Whether this means a melding of the different private exchanges in the
future, or several overlying technologies that provides access across
many borders, is yet to be seen.  I'm willing to bet the future of B2B
commerce will lie somewhere in the neighborhood of the new P2P.

New Tissue Headlines of the Week - May 23, 2001

(Chicago, May 21) NEWS FLASH! The McKinsey Report Does Exist!  In a
brilliant piece of skullduggery, CBT staff members, Luke N. Forlove and
Little Debbie, were able to penetrate the $50 million dollar security
screen erected around Katherine Gehl's office and copy the entire
document. "Well, we kinda waited 'till she went to lunch and while Luke
distracted her assistant with his masculine charms, I copied the entire
25,000 page document on my Brownie camera," Debbie revealed.

While we intend to release the document piecemeal to obviously milk it
for all it's worth, here are the names of some of the various Chapters,
just to whet your appetite: "Intro - Boy Do We Have Problems"; "Chapter
Two - No Silicon Found in Prairie"; "Chapter Five - divine Should
Consider Software Approach"; "Chapter Nine - Tech Jobs Not as Important
as Broadband Plays"; "Chapter 13 - Horse Racing Revenue Possible Funding
Source"; Chapter 42 - More MBAs Needed".

Starting next week, we intend to publish actual material from the
report, so don't miss our next issue!


(Chicago, May 21) Microsoft Misses Boeing - Heads to Chicago Too.  In a
surprise announcement, Bill Gates, Microsoft guru and founder told the
press that he had decided to move the company's headquarters to Chicago.
 "I was shocked an surprised to see that Boeing moved, but then I
checked out their rationale and concluded they were right," Gates said.
Pointing to a PowerPoint presentation that no one could decipher, Mr.
Gates remarked: "After all, when you take into account, climate,
available human resources, the transportation capabilities, it's a
no-brainer."

Sources close to Gates indicated that when Bill found out that the
Playboy Building was available, he jumped at the chance to move.  It's
rumored that Bill has visions of taking on the mantra of Hefner now that
he's stepped down as CEO of the world's largest software company.


(Evanston, May 22) Northwestern University's Mohan Sawhney Makes
Internet Prediction that Comes True! Yes, that's right, Professor
Sawhney has actually made a prognostication that was borne out! Last
week the Professor predicted that Microsoft would move to Chicago.
"After all, when you take into account, climate, available human
resources, the transportation capabilities, it's a no-brainer," Sawhney
cited at a meeting of Internet gurus.

Sources close to Sawhney said that when the Professor heard that the
Playboy Building was available, he easily made the prediction.
"Business is all about collaboration, work flow and relationships. And
who was better at relationships that Hugh Hefner. If Mr. Gates can pick
up where Mr. Hefner left off, Microsoft should be a winner." Sawhney
said.

In a related story, a spokesperson for Viagra was heard to remark, upon
hearing the news, "If Bill uses the Hefner model, he'd better stock up
on our product.  After all, if Windows were a man, not only would there
be performance problems, but shutting down in the middle of a session is
just not going to cut it.

Others in Chicago said that perhaps that was the real reason for the
move.  "Maybe moving to the Playboy Building will inspire them to create
products that get issued to the public prematurely. Premature issuance
is a real problem, especially when, well, you know," a local government
official was quoted as remarking. Most Chicagoans felt that that least
the Windows wallpaper would likely be a bit less dull in the next
Windows product line should Gates be ensconced in town.


(Chicago, May 23) Britannica and Online Unit to Combine - Move Books
Through the Internet. Citing the slower sales of the paper-based
encyclopedia and the struggling revenue model for their e-commerce site,
Britannica spokesperson Winston Miles said: This will really cut down on
expenses.  All we have to do is figure out how to stuff those heavy
books through the wires and we'll really show some progress."

Sources close to Britannica's president say that when he heard that
"broadband" was now widely available, he said, "OK, so if it's broad
enough, then the big fat book should fit, right?"

Shock Therapy
Digging Through the Archives - Do You See A Pattern Here?

By I.P. Daley
Editor In Chief

Hello fellow CBT'ers.  I'm a bit more lucid this week, having been
allowed a lesser dose of my medicine - and while my frontal lobes are
clear, I took some time to visit the hospital's library.  You would be
so surprised to see just how many things were collected ON PAPER before
the Internet reared its ugly head.

The facility actually has a wonderful collection of old newspapers -
yes, a paper document where content was placed on a daily basis and -
you'll never believe this, dear readers - people actually paid to read
it! Really!  I'm not kidding!

Anyway, what I found enervating was that there were real-life stories in
these newspaper things, you know something called "news" that didn't
entail a wonderfully endowed woman or a plastic faced man to interpret
it for us. Think of this crude idea; a person called a "reporter" went
to the site of some "news event" and - now I know you won't believe this
- wrote down the FACTS!  Then, and this is even more fantastic, the
"editor" (a person who actually read all the written down stuff to see
if it made reading sense) let the reporter person put it in the paper
exactly like it happened - he didn't need to "spin" it or check with the
advertisers first!  WOW! No wonder newspapers have ceased to exist.

But I digress. The article I snipped out of the paper seemed vaguely
familiar to me, but I couldn't place it.  No problem, I called Mohan
Sawhney, my old buddy at Kellogg (If he's at Kellogg and he's so famous,
why is it, he's never been on the Corn Flakes box?) and asked him if he
could make the connection for me.  After 1 hour and 45 minutes of
phraseology like: "Strategic Insights into eBusiness Transformation", I
thanked him and rang off. While he didn't provide further illumination,
he did tell me that Kansas was in the Midwest.

Rather than try to figure it out myself, I decided to let you, the
reader, provide me with clues to why this tickled my subconscious.
Please let me know, as I have to go back into confinement and won't be
allowed back into the library until July 17th 2003. All e-mails should
be sent to ipdaley@thechicagobraintrust.com.
Kansas Sun-Times
Hullabaloo Kansas, Dec. 19, 1903.
For Produce Farmer, Automobile Failed Against Horse and Wagon
For 3 generations Samuel L. Ross's family has adopted the latest
technology to keep their farm's production at the head of the class.
"Everyone here abouts knows my father was the first to buy a Deere
reaping machine back in '73," he was quoted as saying during our recent
interview.
But there's one thing you won't see on Ross's farm - any of those new
fangled inventions called the automobile.  "That new fangled horseless
carriage isn't going to cut it when it comes to getting my produce to
market." Ross said while standing along side his farm wagon and team of
horses. "Why the dang thing needs gasoline every 10 miles and it only
hauls 
 ton, compared to 2 ton I can fit on my wagon. Even worse, it
scared the dickens out of Joe Roy's filly."
Ross said he was approached by Ransom E. Olds last year and talked into
purchasing an REO Speed Wagon to use to move his produce to market in
Salinas, over 20 miles away. Eager for a competitive advantage, Ross
jumped at the change to try the auto. But shortly after he purchased the
horseless carriage problems came up. "They didn't tell me you needed
gasoline to run the dang thing - hell I've got lots of oats, but I got
to go into Salinas once a week to get 50 gallons of that stuff. Then I
learned it's even more flammable than kerosene, I can't keep it anywhere
near the stove!"
Sam went on to say that the REO needed things like a "tune up" and
"spark advance" - things he wasn't qualified to do - so he needed to
hire a "mechanic". "Hell, if I'da known that, I'da never bought the
thing."
Seems that the idea behind the auto was wrong. Olds invented the speed
wagon for smaller deliveries in towns like Salinas, and when he tried to
sell it outside of town, it just didn't catch on. In fact, Olds has left
the truck business and is concentrating on carriages for homeowners.
"Hell, he'll fail even faster with that model," Sam said. "No way
families are going to use that."
But all is not lost, Sam's been approached by a gentleman named Francis
E. Stanley, out of Maine who is trying to sell Ross a steam powered
wagon. "Now I'm really considering that," he said, "Steam - that's a
proven technology - just like my tractor and all them locomotives."
Next week, Sam is taking delivery of the steam wagon. "The automobile is
dead, but this here steam wagon, now that's the future. You know, taking
proven technology and applying it to something else."
In an unrelated story, Orville and Wilbur Wright had the audacity to
announce that commercial air travel will be the norm in less than 50
years - this after their "flight" of 120 feet in South Carolina this
week.

UK:
Minor metals - Cobalt bounces, rhodium steadies.

11/16/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Cobalt finally rallied after a lengthy downturn
this week, while the rhodium price spike ran out of steam and antimony
continued to drift in thin trade, traders said.

COBALT REVERSES DECLINE
Cobalt prices finally reversed their recent steady decline this week, with
high-grade metal in particular boosted by a positive response to the latest
tender of stockpile material by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).

"We've seen higher bids from China in the last couple of days, and European
customers are also coming in at higher levels - it looks like the market has
turned," said one trader on Thursday. He quoted a range for Russian 99.3 per
cent material of $11.50-12.00.

Other traders said, however, that some cheap offers of Russian metal in the
$10.80-11.00 range were still in the market.

Swiss-based trader Glencore was the high bidder among five companies at the
DLA's November 15 tender for 597,992 lbs of over 99.9 percent pure cobalt
cathodes.

The company offered prices ranging from $11.04 to $13.02 per lb for 17 lots.

Other bidders were Enron Metals and Commodities, Voss Metals, SFP and
Carolmet.

Despite the high cobalt content in the Gecamines cathodes offered by the DLA,
the material attracts a discount to current prices for Inco and Falconbridge
material, traders said.

"It's Congolese material that's been out of production for about seven years,
and a lot of the superalloy users have amended their specs lists in the
meantime," said one.

"Even though chemically it's perfect for their needs, a number of them don't
have official approval to use it, and that will take a while to come through,"
he added.

High-grade prices on Australian producer WMC Ltd's website,
www.wmc-cobalt.com, jumped by $2 in the space of 24 hours.

The company reported a sale at $13.25 a lb - the lowest level since late July
- on November 15, but subsequently did business up to $14.60 and was offering
at $15.25, basis November, CIF main Asian ports or delivered works Europe and
North America by Thursday. Total sales for the week to date exceeded 50
tonnes.

"The price gets to a point where it's so low that people can't hold back any
longer, and once it starts going up buyers come in for fear of missing the
boat," said another trader.

ANTIMONY STEADY, TRADE THIN

Antimony prices were steady in thin trade this week, with 99.65 percent
material indicated in a range of $1,450/1,550 a tonne.

Cheap material currently on offer, although the antinony content is 99.65
percent, often contains sufficient quantities of impurities such as bismuth to
make it unusable for trioxide producers, consumers said.

"We've seen offers around $1,450 but to get good-quality Hunan material
trioxide producers would have to pay around $100 more than that," said one.

The market is unlikely to feel the full impact of the Chinese clampdown on
fresh export licenses for this year until stocks already in Europe have been
used up, traders said.

"There's a lot of material either in Rotterdam or afloat - once this is used
up I think we'll see prices pick up again."

Export licenses for 2001 are expected to be granted around the end of January,
with fresh metal unlikely to be shipped until the following month, traders
said.

RHODIUM PRICES STABILISE

Rhodium prices softened marginally as the market stabilised following last
week's sharp short-covering rally, traders said.

"We've seen a slight easing back, though there are plenty of Japanese
companies lining up to take material on spot or long-term contracts if they
don't feel they can trust the Russian side of things," said one.

Spot free-market rhodium was quoted at around $2,050/$2,150 an ounce, down
some $50 from last week's highs, although traders said spot material remains
tight.

Sales of rhodium to auto-makers are up strongly in 2000, boosted by higher
vehicle production, tighter emissions legislation and changes in the platinum
group metals mix in autocatalysts, Johnson Matthey said this week in its
Platinum 2000 interim review.

On the supply side, Russian supplies of rhodium were seen totalling 280,000
ounces in 2000, more than four times last year's total, JM said. The precious
metals refiner forecast total global supplies of rhodium to jump 236,000
ounces to 737,000 ounces this year, with South African supplies seen rising to
434,000 ounces.

Mr. Sutton,

I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
commercial flights both ways.

   Sunday, February 27
   Depart Houston @ 8:00a.m.
   Arrive London @ 11:52p.m. (same day)

Please advise.

Liz Taylor
Assistant to Greg Whalley

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  
Here are the main points from their conversation

1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with 
confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they 
hadn't already."  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that 
"they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest 
equity holders were screaming not to do it."

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are 
"speculative" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they 
thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the 
bankruptcy court."

2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power 
for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only 
reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the 
market could handle."  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average 
peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the 
difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State 
Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3. New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority 
(authorized by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop 
until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  
Angelides expects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer."

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

Mostly a legislative update today. The extraordinary session is about to 
close without 
passing the windfall profits bills.  Note that the legislative leadership is 
trying to 
rollover pending legislation such as SB1X/AB128X to the new extraordinary 
session.

I will be out of the office for the next week, so California reports will be 
sent to you by Kristin Walsh, x39510.

RJ


- There is some procedural dispute over who closes the extraordinary
session - the legislature or the governor.  Sources believe that the
governor actually closes the session and that he likely will do so after he
signs SB 31X at noon.

- Sources do not believe that the excess windfall profits tax
bills (SB 1X/AB 128X) are close enough to be passed by a vote before the
governor signs SB 31X.

- SB 28X, a power plant siting bill, has just passed the Assembly 74-0 and
is headed to the Senate.  The unemployment compensation provision, a source
of controversy, has been taken out.

- The Senate reportedly is only hearing regular session bills at this time.
As of 10:45 a.m. PDT, no extraordinary session bills were scheduled to be
heard on the Senate floor.  However, sources indicate that the Senate may
waive some rules to move bills to the floor faster.

- Once the extraordinary session is closed, a new extraordinary session is
expected to be opened immediately.  However, sources report that no one is
certain if the bills from this session will have the same numbers in the
next session.  The legislature reportedly is trying to arrange so that the
bills will not have to be heard again in committee.

		 Subject: Raptor Position Reports for 11/20/00

The Raptor I credit capacity is at $94 million.  The credit capacity will be 
impacted by fourth quarter revaluations on Catalytica, Heartland Steel and 
other assets.  If the credit capacity is exceeded, Enron will need to reserve 
for the loss and any future losses.

The TNPC stock closed at $9.38 on November 20.  The closing price on November 
21 is $8.94 which results Raptor III exceeding its credit capacity by $12 
million.

Attached is the draft press release for Cinergy's purchase of the Brownsville 
and Caledonia peakers.  They are routing it to their Treasury department for 
final review with respect to the opinion of their ratings agency.  If 
everyone at Cinergy signs off, they plan to release this morning.  They will 
call me prior to release.

If you have any changes, please contact me ASAP.  Thanks.

I am pleased to announce that yesterday (May 3) we closed the sale of the 
Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln peaker plants to Allegheny. The completion of 
this LONG transaction was truly a team effort!  We are currently planning a 
closing celebration, and I will follow up with the details.

Thanks again for everyone's contribution.

(Sorry for the day delay in the announcement but as you know Outlook was down 
yesterday)

Power Curve 5: Forward Power Continues Softening; Implications

* The Power Curve has softened since our last analysis (Power Curve 4,
May 2).  Forward expectations are down 11%, 15% and 9% for 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.  The Spark Spread, an important measure of profit
potential, has declined further: down 18%, 32% and 84%, respectively.
* Shape of curve remains "backwardated" - decreasing from a peak this
summer.
* Softening trend has continued since January.  This period every
region was affected with California and the West showing the largest
declines.
* Power Producers: most favorable commodity pricing environment this
summer--continue to expect positive earnings surprises 2Q and perhaps 3Q.
* Recommendation to investors:  Expect near-term strength in Producers
keyed off of strong 2Q expectations.  Recommend shifting portfolio toward
Energy Merchants as we move into the summer.  Maintain positive ratings on
both groups of stocks given strong near-term earnings visibility.

Dear eChampion,

Please review the following fact sheet and quotes, and forward to family,
friends, and associates. It is time for truth to prevail and for Gore to
concede.

Thank you,
Jim Nicholson
Chairman, RNC

****************************************************************
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:
There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have never been counted.
David Boies: "[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been counted
once for the presidency of the United States." [Today Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:

* Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once on  election
night and again during the automatic recount.

* In every election, there are a significant number of ballots that are cast
by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot, including
races for President. For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in
Idaho, 3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in Wyoming cast
a ballot without registering a vote for President.

* The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing) about which the
Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only 1.6% of the ballots cast
in Miami-Dade. These ballots were counted - twice; they merely registered no
vote for President

* This reality reflects common sense: a voter may want to vote for a
candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be undecided about the
choice for President. In particular, a voter who usually votes for
candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates, but be
uncomfortable with his or her party's choice for President and yet unwilling
to vote for the other party's candidate. So he or she might cast a ballot
without marking a choice for President.

MYTH:
If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the
recount, Gore would actually be ahead by 9 votes.

FACT:

* Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from
the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount
from Miami-Dade, and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and
some of the certified votes from Nassau County.

* The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday for completing
manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory time period for counting
mandated by  Florida's Legislature.

* Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Court's
deadline. Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with
a manual recount.

* The 157 "interim gain" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a selective recount
of the most Democrat precincts. Gore won these selected precincts by
approximately 75% to 25%, while Gore won the entire county only by 53% to
46%. It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting
Republican precincts, too.

* Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those with predominantly Hispanic and
Cuban American voters, favored Bush. The Gore approach would treat these
minorities in a discriminatory fashion.

* Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law
should be counted. Counties recognized this and counted them. Even Joe
Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected.

& Even if you add the 157 interim gain for Gore in Miami-Dade
and the final manual recount of net 192 for Gore in Palm Beach (as reported
by the NYT), and then also subtract the over 50 votes that belong to Bush in
Nassau County (see below), Bush still wins by well over 100 votes.

MYTH:
Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican
"mob" that "intimidated" the canvassing board.  KLAIN: "We think already
almost 160 votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the
count.... But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility,
stop a count, and then that's going to provide the end because a partisan of
the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept returns and cuts off the
counting, I don't think that's the kind of end that we have to American
elections." [GMA, 11/27/00]

FACT:

* The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's decision
to move the recount behind closed doors, where it could not be observed by
the public or the media, and to limit the recount to only a select set of the
votes.

* No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision, and
Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not
intimidated by the crowd. ???? The police made no arrests, received no
assault complaints, and did not even instruct the crowd to desist. The crowd
was quieted promptly.

MYTH:
In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier
tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal.

FACT:

* On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from the rest, and
not counted. As a result, Bush received 124 fewer votes and Gore received 73
fewer votes than on election night.

* After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her
mistake, and tried to correct it. Because the Supreme Court of Florida had
held the date open for final certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the
Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count
to make it accurate.

* The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to certify the
original election night count - which included the 218 ballots - rather than
the machine recount total (which mistakenly omitted those ballots).

*******************************************************
QUOTES:

Mr. Gore, the Wheel has Turned and it's Time for this to End...

"I think the vice president should take the high ground and hand it over,"
Rep. Julia Carson, D-IN
- Associated Press interview conducted over the phone, 11/27/00.

"Mr. Gore, End It Now," - Editorial headline in the Chicago Tribune,
11/27/00

"Enough is enough, For nation's welfare, Gore should accept loss," -
Editorial headline in the San Diego Union-Tribune, 11/27/00

"...I have grave doubts about whether it is wise for the country,  for the
purposes of just healing all of the wounds, for the vice president to
continue to pursue and to contest the results in Florida."
- Former Clinton/Gore Labor Secretary Robert Reich

"His determination to keep fighting, even after Sunday night's  formal
declaration that George W. Bush won the presidential race in Florida,
presents the increasingly unappealing portrait of a man who wants to be a
winner at any cost."
- Chicago Tribune, Editorial, 11/27/00

"The only thing to be gained by contesting the Florida balloting, as  Sen.
Joseph Lieberman vowed last night to do, is to put the nation through a
divisive ordeal that could provoke a constitutional crisis unprecedented in
modern times."
- San Diego Union-Tribune, Editorial, 11/27/00

Palm Beach Canvassing Judge Charles Burton: "...going into this, we  felt
that whatever standard we came up with...it had to be fair, it had to be
geared towards achieving a fair result, not geared towards achieving a
certain result...

"...the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, everybody agreed to the
standard we had applied in reviewing these ballots. It was only after about
four days into it that the Democratic Party went back to court to try and,
you know, basically have us change that standard because I guess they
realized they weren't getting enough votes."
- ABC's "Good Morning America," 11/27/00

Hi John,

Have you sent Greg Enron Europe's 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to

Subject: Final Commission Decision on Rate Design

At the continuation meeting held this afternoon, the Commission voted out
the Alternate Proposed Decision on SCE/PG&E rate design.  The vote was 3 to
2, with Bilas and Duque voting "no".

Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it
is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not
put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a
lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues,
the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on
agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU
customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places
an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this
average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh.
The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I
am assuming that the "average rate increase" refers to the average across
TOU periods.

I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary
tomorrow.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please call.

Jeanne Bennett

Regarding the question as to how much of a "haircut" generators
would be willing to take, we have received the following reports:

- It appears at this point that many generators would be disinclined to
accept a 70% haircut without getting something in return.  For instance, 
generators might agree to this in return for immunity from further state 
prosecution for damages, anti-trust issues, etc.

- The 70% haicut "consensus" in the legislature should not be overstated. The 
Democrats originally proposed this, and the Republicans yesterday essentially 
said "me too" in announcing their Plan B.  However, sources report that there 
remains disagreement in the legislature over this number, despite the fact 
that it is the number most often suggested as of now.

- We will continue to make inquiries on this question and will report in more 
detail as soon as possible.

Subject: Enron in Europe: E.On fails in bid to expand water business


E.On fails in bid to expand water business

11/17/2000
Handelsblatt English Summary
Copyright 2000 Handelsblatt. Source: World Reporter (Trade Mark) - FT
McCarthy.

  HB/svu DUSSELDORF. Expansion plans of German utility E.On AG suffered
another setback Thursday with the failure of takeover negotiations with
water utilities Azurix of the U.S. and France's Saur.

  Hans-Dieter Harig, head of E.On Energie AG, confirmed to Handelsblatt
that talks with Azurix had been called off, and that negotiations with
Saur, France's third-largest water utility, had also ended
unsuccessfully.
  These latest developments appear to bring to an end for the time being
to plans by E.On chairman Ulrich Hartmann to take his group to the top
of the industry rankings in its core energy segments  electricity, gas,
and water.

  In August this year, E.On pulled out of advanced talks with France's
water giant Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, after the two companies failed to
reach agreement on valuation.

  The takeover of Azurix stumbled at the same hurdle, sector insiders
said  even though Azurix's parent, U.S. energy group Enron, has been
trying to sell the unit for some time. In 1999, Azurix generated sales
of around $618 million.

  Talks with Saur were broken off at an early stage, people familiar
with the matter said. E.On's official line is that "no negotiations are
taking place with Saur." The French group generated sales of 2.3 billion
euros on 1999.

  The failure of the talks now puts E.On at a disadvantage vis-a-vis its
closest German rival, RWE AG.

  RWE chairman Dietmar Kuhnt this week proudly announced the completion
of the takeover of Britain's Thames Water, which takes his Essen-based
group to third position in the European water-utility rankings, behind
France's Suez and Vivendi.

  E.On, meanwhile, appears to have few options left that would allow it
to grow quickly through acquisitions. Instead, it is now likely to
pursue its goals in smaller steps.

  The group's growth strategy has so far only been realized in
electricity. Through its creation from the merger of Veba and Viag it
moved up to fourth position in Europe, behind Electricite de France,
Italy's Enel and RWE. The latter gained a slight lead on E.On through
its merger with VEW AG.

  In gas, E.On still has some ground to cover. Hartmann has been trying
for month to buy a majority stake in Ruhrgas AG, Europe's largest gas
trader. He has the support of Klaus Liesen, who chairs the supervisory
boards of both E.On and Ruhrgas.

  But Ruhrgas' complicated shareholding structure is likely to make any
investment lengthy and expensive. Co-shareholders Thyssen-Krupp and
Mannesmann/Vodafone as well as oil multinationals like BP, Shell or
Exxon-Mobil are likely to sell their shares in Ruhrgas only at high
premiums. Sector insiders said premiums of up to 30% were currently
under discussion. Ruhrgas' current market value stands at more than 10
billion euros.

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Dave and John

California Regulators Back Rate Increase For Utilities

* California regulators indicated yesterday that they are willing to
raise rates for electric utilities EIX and PCG,  following a review of their
finances
* Hearings to review utilities' financial status in hearings on Dec.
27 and 28
* KEY DATE:  January 4, when we expect they will vote to raise rates
* We see this action as positive for the utilities, because it reduces
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy, although further action is
required, in our view
* We also see it as positive for our Growth Energy companies.  Any
reduction in financial pressure on the utilities equates to reduced pressure
to re-regulate the wholesale power industry, in our view
* The results of the action were in line with our expectation; we
recommend investors buy the Growth Energy names on weakness.  In particular,
we highlight DYN, CPN, NRG, SOE and DUK.

HoustonTexans.com Weekly Update
Nov. 17, 2000

HELPING HANDS
The Texans celebrated the conclusion of their 2000 United Way Campaign at
Pennzoil Place Thursday. And the results were just what Texans Owner Bob
McNair was seeking when he launched the campaign a month ago. All 71 Texans
employees contributed. Seven donated $10,000 or more. McNair and his wife
Janice matched the total contribution of the club, bringing the Texans'
total to $205,000.

"Thank you so much for helping us be a part of your team," said Jacqueline
S. Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. "For you to
believe so much in our mission to impact the community is overwhelming. I am
floored with the 100 percent participation. It is absolutely unheard of."

The McNairs are no stranger to the United Way, but the team gives them a
more visible platform for their charitable work.

"We're delighted with everyone's participation," Bob McNair said. "It was a
tremendous team effort."

The NFL has worked with the United Way for the past quarter-century, using
its players, coaches and staff to help member cities and their surrounding
communities.

OUT AND ABOUT
Texans Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly visited the
University of Nebraska earlier this week. He heads to the Meadowlands Sunday
to scout the Giants-Lions game.

REALIGNMENT TALKS
Representatives from 17 NFL teams met in Denver Wednesday for discussions on
realignment for the 2002 season, when the Texans hit the field. The NFL will
expand to eight four-team divisions in 2002, placing the Texans in the AFC.
Houston -- as well as transplanted teams in Baltimore, St. Louis and
Tennessee -- does not have a vote in the realignment proposal.

"Those were preliminary discussions in Denver this week," Casserly says.
"There will be a meeting in mid-January just on the realignment issue. The
league has set June as a target date for realignment to be finalized."

6. More than 500 employees are currently working on the project. Looking for

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

So I've joined the real world - and it got me a trip to Vegas (Day of the
Trader in Dec). All roads wind up in Vegas.
How's it going with my buddy Dorsey? I assume since you didn't answer the

Hope all is well.

Working with Amitava Dhar,  Vasant Shanbhogue and John Best,  we completed 
the following analysis to determine max loss for our portfolio of 
transactions for the balance of 2001.

A Model simulation yields max loss of less than $60 million for our total 
portfolio in 2001.

 Comments:  We ran several simulations in the model with 10,000 trials 
showing a max loss without hedges of $49,500,000 - $52,000,000. In 
otherwords, the  highest possible loss experienced in all runs was less than 
$52 million.  We also ran one simulation at 30,000 trials and the max loss 
did not vary   significantly from the earlier trials. Our conclusion from the 
results of the model runs is that the 1 in 100,000 trial would produce a max 
loss (P99.999) of less  than $60 million vs the notional P100 payout of $280 
million.

 This does not address the "Venus falling into the Sun" scenario. Since 
running the simulation does not produce a max loss approaching the P100, we 
had  to go outside the model and create a spread sheet that would force a 
scenario that generated the full loss.

B.  Worst case scenario of all units down on day 1 hits maximum payout of 
$280 million over 5 days.

 Comments: In the spread sheet we assumed an unrealistic scenario that all 
units go down on day one for 5 days. Taking the total MWh covered for each  
unit, we then calculated the power price necessary to hit the maximum dollar 
payout for each unit given a 5 day outage. The 5 day price spike for each  
power market ranged from $1,500 in Entergy to $700 in PJM. Under this 
unrealistic scenario we would reach our maximum payout of $280 million in 5 
days.

C. Power option hedges generate offsetting cash value of $ 215 million, 
reducing our net P100 exposure to less than $65 million

 Comments: We then layered our proposed hedging strategy on top of the 
unrealistic spread sheet scenario in 2 above. Assuming the 5 day price spike  
replicated the forward curve in the MidWest during 1999, a spot market at 
$1,500 pulled forward prices up to a range of $250-$300/MWh. The option   
hedges we would put in place would cost $14-15 million and would yield $215mm 
in positive MTM to offset the payout  of $280 million, giving us the net  
Maximun risk of $65 million.

We need to present our calculations to Vince tomorrow morning to get his sign 
off and can then go over the analysis in detail with you and Greg immediately 
afterwards. We are still not recommending we put the full hedge in place to 
cover this unrealistic scenareo, but the analysis shows we can significantly 
cover the tail risk in our book without having insurance in place. Our 
recommendation remains to put a smaller hedge in place while we continue to 
pursue a insurance partner during the month of June.

Speak to you tomorrow.

Subject: Duke Energy proposes to manage SDG&E's entire electricity load for 
five years


The note below was sent to the 20 or so reporters that I have been working
with on the CA electricity crisis.

FYI.

Below is a press release we distributed today that details a proposal we
have made to San Diego Gas & Electric to manage their entire electricity
load (up to 3,300 megawatts) for five years at a fixed price of $60 a
megawatt hour.  The proposal was detailed in our comments to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions to
Caifornia.

As the release indicates, forward contracting for electricity is a very
effective way for the state's utilities to manage the volitility in the
state's electricity markets.  With natural gas prices more than doubling
since last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last year
on the spot market (up to $19 a million BTU vs. an average of about $2.50
in 1999), we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage of
these contracts so they can manage their own risk  exposure and their
customer's risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices.
(The price of natural gas represents about 90 percent of our plant's
operating costs).

We signed a forward power contract with PG&E Oct. 30 and Southern Cal
Edison Nov. 15 (announced for the first time in the this release).  The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind of
contracts -- and we hope that we, or other wholesale power marketers, can
do more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDG&E in the very
near future to bring stability to the state's wholesale electricity market.

Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing, which
also includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis.
These are also detailed on our CA web site at
www.Duke-Energy.com/California.

For more information, call me at 805-595-4270 or page me at 877-364-5170.

The  first  quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the
businesses  under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin
number  of  $100  million  for  the  first  quarter.  This represents a 38%
increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined
with  outstanding  results  posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed
over  $187  million  to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was
due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In  order  to  keep  the  momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the
following changes and additions have been made within the organization.

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill  Berkeland  has  joined  the  group  and is responsible for creating a
focused  mid-marketing  function  specifically  within  this  group.   Fred
Lagrasta  is  responsible  for  mid-marketing  for Enron Americas and still
maintains  some  responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.
The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude
and  product  specific  products and services.  This group reports to Randy
Maffett.

Origination
In  order  to  manage  the  increased  origination opportunities around the
world,  the  Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the
proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.
Doug  Friedman  will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting
to  John  Nowlan.   Joining  Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from
Union  Carbide.   The global crude and products origination group has added
Randy  O'Conner  from  Red  Meteor,  who  has extensive experience in these
markets.   Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will
report to Randy Maffett.

Trading
Lee  Jackson  will  assume  the  role  of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader,
supported  by  Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have
been  reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for
plastics trading in the Americas.

Shipping
Scott  Moncrieff  will assume responsibility of our global shipping network
related  to  crude  and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all
aspects  of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence
in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The  weather  group  under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts
around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office
will  focus  on  new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron
from  Castlebridge  Partners  and  will  be moving to London to develop and
expand  the  continental  opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in
London,  will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and
has  responsibility  for  origination activities for North America.  Bill's
most  recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather
office  managed  by  Thor  Lien  will  have  responsibility for Scandinavia
weather  activities.   In  addition,  employees  are  being  added  in  the
Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around
the world on EnronOnline.

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination
activities  with  generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was
as  the  head  of  all  regulatory  activities  for Enron Europe, Japan and
Australia.

Enron Japan
The  momentum  of  power  deregulation  process  has  slowed in Japan.  The
decision  has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe
Hirl,  President  and  CEO  of  Enron  Japan,  will now report into the EGM
organization.   Joe  will  maintain his direct responsibility of the office
and  will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of
these  products  have  high growth potential in both the near and long-term
and  he  will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and
their activities.

LNG
LNG  continues  to  expand  with  the  vision  to  increase  the  number of
transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around
the   world.    Jonathan  Whitehead  has  joined  the  LNG  group  and  has
responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser,
from  Enron  Americas  - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global
Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of
origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM  has  concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris
Kravas  continues  to  focus  on  building  the spot trading and mid-market
capabilities  that  will enable it to be the dominant player in its market,
and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from
EBS,   has  joined  Shawn  Cumberland's  origination  effort,  and  Deirdre
McCaffrey,  from  Gas  Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's
forward trading group focusing on diesel products.

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly
built  a  team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price
call  options,  a  hybrid  insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and
Enron  resources,  this  team  is  based  in  New  York  and  includes Alex
Tartakovski  and  Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony
Chang  who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction
closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad  Blesie  will  be  moving  to  London  in  June to establish a base of
operation  for  GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the
European  market  place.  Among the opportunities he is currently exploring
are  contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading
insolvent  insurance  claims,  and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk
with decommissioning insurance.

In  April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New
York  reporting  to  Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to
New  York  from  LNG  in  Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our
commodity  trading  relationship  with  hedge  funds  to include crude oil,
products,  liquids  and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in
this  effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power
trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa   Piekielniak   has  assumed  responsibility  for  Enron's  developing
agriculture  business.   Billy  Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the
Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to
the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race. 
Kind Regards, 
George Dorsey

Lou, are there concerns that I am not aware?  From an economic point of view, 
it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers 
who have retail choice; however, standard office service (like the UI deal) 
is clearly a customized, wholesale/all -requirements sale of significant size 
negotiated with the utility and the puc.

Greg,

I work in the accounting group for TechQuest Capital and was wondering if
you had a contact for me in your accounting department.  We haven't received
payment for our invoice and I wanted to inquiry about its status.

Thank you for your help.

Dear Friends,

President-elect Bush has brought together an excellent group to serve as his
Cabinet.  His nominees are a diverse, experienced, and strong group.  They
will help enact his agenda, change the tone in Washington and make us proud.

Your help is needed to get these outstanding men and women confirmed by the
United States Senate.  Some of President-elect Bush's nominees are being
unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from
you.

One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft,
President-elect Bush's choice for Attorney General.

The hallmark of Senator Ashcroft's long history of public service has been
integrity.  As Attorney General, he will uphold the law and make the
Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of.

He brings a unique record of service to this challenge.  He was twice
elected Missouri's Attorney General, serving with both Republican and
Democrat Governors.  He was elected Governor of Missouri, an important swing
state, and then reelected with 64% of the vote.  John then was elected to
the U.S. Senate, where he just finished a six-year term.  No other Attorney
General has ever had this wealth of experience.

John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues, including:

- Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri
Attorney General's office by attracting strong men and women to serve his
state and strictly upholding the law
- As Senator, co-Sponsored the Violence Against Women Act
- As Governor, signed Missouri's first Hate-Crimes Bill and fought to
protect victims' rights
- Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor
- Made Education Reform a priority as Governor
- Toughened penalties for crimes committed with a Gun
- Worked To protect children at school, strengthen classroom safety
- Voted For background checks at pawn shops
- Was Endorsed By Missouri Law Enforcement Agencies
- Supported 26 of 28 African-Americans nominated to the Federal bench
- Was commended as Governor by one of the oldest Black Bar Associations for
his record of appointing minorities
- Appointed many African-Americans to Missouri's courts
- Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King
holiday
- Created an award honoring George Washington Carver's Accomplishments,
saved Lincoln College, an historic Black college founded by African-American
veterans of the Civil War.

Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge
Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Every Republican
Senator opposed White's confirmation, in part, because he urged a lower
legal standard for a man convicted of first-degree murder 4 times (including
the first degree murder of three police officers).

Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he
disagrees.  This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new
Administration.  Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to
carry out the letter of the law.   He will restore the rule of law to the
Justice Department and run a highly professional department.

Please do two things.

First, let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation
process for John Ashcroft.

Go to http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm to find the
contact information for the Senators from your state.

Second, let the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee know you support
John Ashcroft's confirmation.  The committee begins its hearings Tuesday.
Its members are: http://www.senate.gov/~judiciary/members.htm

D(DE) Biden Jr, Joseph, (202) 224-5042, senator@biden.senate.gov
R(OH) DeWine, Mike, (202) 224-2315, 
http://www.senate.gov/~dewine/request_form.html

D(CA) Feinstein, Dianne, (202) 224-3841, senator@feinstein.senate.gov
R(IA) Grassley, Chuck,, (202) 224-3744, http://grassley.senate.gov/webform.htm
R(UT) Hatch, Orrin, (202) 224-5251, senator_hatch@hatch.senate.gov
D(MA) Kennedy, Edward, (202) 224-4543, senator@kennedy.senate.gov
D(WI) Kohl, Herb, (202) 224-5653, senator_kohl@kohl.senate.gov
R(AZ) Kyl, Jon, (202) 224-4521, info@kyl.senate.gov
D(VT) Leahy, Patrick, (202) 224-4242, senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov
D(NY) Schumer, Charles, (202) 224-6542, senator@schumer.senate.gov
R(AL) Sessions, Jeff, (202) 224-4124, senator@sessions.senate.gov
R(NH) Smith, Bob, (202) 224-2841, opinion@smith.senate.gov
R(PA) Specter, Arlen, (202) 224-4254, http://specter.senate.gov/webform.htm
R(SC) Thurmond, Strom, (202) 224-5972, senator@thurmond.senate.gov
D(NJ) Torricelli, Robert, (202) 224-3224 
senator_torricelli@torricelli.senate.gov

Finally, two recent comments from current United States Senators:

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) had this to say about the Ashcroft
nomination:

"'I think it represents a very good choice'. . . the only things people want
in an attorney general are 'good management, sound judgment and high
integrity.  They're not easy to find in one individual, but I think John
Ashcroft has all of them.'"  "I certainly assume I will be voting for
him."  - Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) (David Kocieniewski, "Staunch Democrat
Eases Up on Opposition," The New York Times, January 6, 2001; Audrey Hudson,
"Democrats Set For Ashcroft's Confirmation," The Washington Times, January
4, 2001) (emphasis added)

Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) Commended Ashcroft.

"I rise to pay tribute to Senator John Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the
Senate. . . . Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who served his
state and his country with distinction.  I join my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors."  (Congressional
Record, December 15, 2000)

Thank you.

(Please forward this message to friends, family and co-workers and ask them
to show their support for President-elect Bush by asking their U.S. Senators
to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft)

Good Afternoon, Mr. Whalley!

I am the Editor of the ENA Newsletter and we are interested in having you as 
a Profile article in our next issue. (Actually, your name was recommended to 
me by Mark Frevert and Janet Dietrich.)  The ENSIDE is set for publication in 
February and I am setting my interview schedule now. I would love to sit down 
and visit with you for about 30 minutes, when it is convenient for you.

Please let me know what you think!  I will call you later and we can discuss 
it.

Dear Louise and Greg:

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten "wireless companies to watch."   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Sincerely, David Marcus

Election 2000:
HOW BUSH WOULD LEAD

Greg,

Michael asked me to get back to you regarding ICE's all-share Offer for IPE.

Summary of Offer

The key aspects of the Offer are as follows:

? It comprises a share-for-share exchange of 1 ICE Class A1 Share and 1 ICE 
Class B (Redeemable) Share for each IPE Share (note that ICE Shares are not 
listed on any exchange).

? The following values (given by Goldman Sachs and KPMG) have been ascribed 
to each such ICE Share:

 - each ICE Class A1 Share has an estimated value ranging from $1.75 to $6.11
 - assuming redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value ranging 
from $4.80 to $5.33
 - assuming no redemption, each ICE Class B Share has an estimated value in 
the same range as each A1 Share

? Class B Shares allow for certain rights of redemption by ICE for cash, 
namely $5.895 per share.  Redemption rights arise for a period of one month 
from the first anniversary of the date on which the IPE Brent Futures and the 
Gasoil Futures Contracts have traded exclusively for 10 consecutive trading 
days through the electronic trading platform.  Redemption rights also arise 
in other circumstances, e.g. if ICE is the subject of an insolvency event.  
After the first redemption event to occur, non-redeemed Class B Shares 
(redemption is at the option of the shareholder) automatically convert to 
Class A1 Shares.

? Although ICE Shares will not be listed, it is expected that there will be a 
limited dealing facility through which Class B shareholders will be able to 
trade.

? The electronic trading platform referred to above will be developed by ICE 
through a technical services agreement.

? Class A Shares are transferable to any transferee, subject to ICE board 
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.  Other than in relation to the 
redemption rights described above, Class B Shares have identical rights to 
Class A Shares.

? Assuming all of the IPE Holdings shares are acquired by ICE, then the IPE 
Holdings' shareholders will hold 10% of the issued share capital of ICE.

? The Offer is subject to valid acceptances being received by 29 May in 
respect of at least 90% of the value of IPE Holdings shares (or any lower % 
determined by ICE, but being at least 50%).

Other Points to Note

? Enron's current shareholding in IPE Holdings is 136,720 shares (this is 
equivalent to 1.19% of the total share capital of IPE Holdings).

? Those members of ICE (or companies associated with members of ICE) having 
shareholdings in IPE Holdings account for 9.83% of the total share capital of 
IPE Holdings. You should therefore assume that acceptances will be received 
at least as to 9.83%.

? If ICE receives acceptances as to 90% or more of the IPE Holdings shares, 
then our shares in IPE Holdings can be mandatorily acquired.

? If we are to make a competing offer, we will needed to have appointed a 
financial advisor, carried out necessary due diligence and preferably 
discussed details with IPE's management. Bearing in mind the closing date of 
29 May, we would have to move quickly if we are to make an offer. (This is 
assuming that acceptances in excess of 50% have not been received by that 
time - however, institutional investors tend to deliver acceptances only at 
the last minute).  We could make an announcement prior to the closing date of 
29 May that we were considering making an offer, although the prior approval 
of the Takeover Panel would be needed  - and a short timetable would be set 
by the Panel for announcing full details of the offer, if we were to 
proceed.  

? Given the particular components of ICE's offer (e.g. retained equity in 
ICE; the complementary nature of the ICE and IPE businesses; and the critical 
participation of ICE in developing IPE's electronic trading platform), we 
should consider carefully the terms of any competing offer we may decide to 
make. 

Please would you let me know what further steps you would like to take 
(including whether you would accept the ICE Offer), and if there is any 
further information you need. (I will send you separately by fax a copy of 
the Offer Document).

Thanks
Justin

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

Just a few of questions.

1. Will Kevin take MTM income on this position on "day one?"

2. Why just 5 years sold?

3. Does your 9% contemplate covering depreciation?

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Did you talk to Dynegy about buying the engine behind EnronOnline?

I know Andy is going to work for Arnold in the next 4 to 6 weeks, but he is 
getting a team geared up around selling some EnronOnline licenses to various 
markets like Agriculture, crude/petchems, energy, etc.  We would not support 
software behind someone else's firewall, but these would be dedicated 
environments we set up and license and possibly support (what you and I 
talked about last week).  We have some traction with some companies like Dow 
and GM on an application license as well as renting them a row or rows on 
EnronOnline, but those sales have some cultural issues associated with them 
as well.  

I think you and I could actually originate some license deals on our own with 
Dynegy, Calpine, Duke and El Paso.  I briefly brought it up with Posoli (in 
addition to mid/back office outsourcing which we will pitch to him the first 
week in June) and he said he doesn't want to create CalpineOnline.com, but he 
said that just being able to wire together his gas and power traders on the 
back end would be great.  Clearly, Lavo needs to agree that he is comfortable 
with others in this space having these tools.  I think I know the commercial 
lead at El Paso, you and I know some people at Duke, you know Dynegy and and 
I know Posoli too well.  You probably have other contacts I am not aware of 
as well.

I think if we got serious traction on 4 or 5 licenses, then the application 
companies would be real strong bids for the business later if we want to let 
someone else build it from 5 to 100 licenses.  The whole issue is that we are 
stuck in the starting block at zero license sales and the 
application/software companies we have talked to love the application but are 
nervous, despite our reputation as the great company that gets technology and 
has the best site/system in the world, about taking huge risk on code that is 
proven in a single enterprise situation, Enron.

We will continue to see if Reuters, CommerceOne, Sungard, TibCo, i2, etc. are 
interested in owning all or part of the intellectual property, but they 
currently seem to be a low bid for raw source code with no proven customers 
other than Enron in an environment where they have been beat up and are 
reluctant to print stock or deplete cash.  However, some of them have yet to 
show their bid so we will let that process continue.

On mid and back office, I am met with Vickers and Tycholiz and am seeing 
Mrha, Luce and Duran this week.  They all get the basic premise.  Sally is on 
board and focused on operations/pricing.  I think the reorg we just had will 
work.  We should have a draft of an agreement with SLAs soon for physical 
gas, physical power and financial.  It would be used for you and others.  We 
should be hitting the market with the tier 2 and 3 customers in a few weeks.  
I gave Tom six new people who would focus on selling these services, working 
with EA folks and have experience in Sally's shop.

You and I could also talk to the shops above about at least having ProcessCo 
for all energy OTC deals as we discussed.

Your thoughts on selling licenses to companies so close to our core product 
line?

I regret to announce that David Gallagher has decided to leave Enron.  David 
has led our Continental Gas group for the last 2 years, and has built for us 
a market leading franchise and the best team in the industry.  David is a 
highly respected individual both within the company and outside the company, 
and we will miss his professional attitude and great character.

He leaves a very strong team behind him.  Didier Magne and Carsten Sterz have 
built this business with David from day one, and they will continue to own 
their respective books: France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Spain for 
Didier, and all the German-speaking countries plus Eastern Europe for 
Carsten.  Dave Furner will continue to trade the Zeebrugge hub.  Nicola Craig 
will continue to run the Continental option books.  Rudy Dautel, director, 
will join the group as Head Trader, and Didier, Carsten and Nicola will 
report to him.  Dave Furner will report to Didier Magne.  Rudy has a wealth 
of trading experience in US nat gas, crude oil, UK nat gas, and most recently 
Spanish power and LNG.  Rudy will report to me.
Steve Asplin, director, will head up large scale origination for Continental 
gas, as distinct from the trading / mid-marketing functions of Didier and 
Carsten.  Steve will report to me.
Cathy Christmas will continue with her key role as Head of Operations for the 
group, reporting to David Hutchinson.
 All other reporting lines will remain the same.

Please join me in wishing David well for the future, and congratulating Rudy, 
Steve, Carsten and Didier on their new and expanded roles.

NYMEX sees private placement before IPO.

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange, which this 
month converted to a for-profit company, is aiming to sell shares to the 
public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors, 
NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday.  But no part of the world's 
largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the 
launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform, now targeted for 
early May, Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview.  "I'd say three 
to nine months (after the private placement) depending on market conditions 
and eNYMEX traction," Rappaport said, referring to the initial public 
offering (IPO). NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself 
and modernize for the 21st century.  The reorganizing London Metal Exchange 
(LME) voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading 
while the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) went wholly 
to electronic trading on Monday, waving goodbye to the shouts and hand 
signals of traditional open outcry trade.  NYMEX demutualized 10 days ago, 
changing its not-for-profit membership structure into that of a 
profit-seeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange 
Inc.  No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from 
the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil, natural gas, 
electricity, heating oil and gasoline on the floor. Rappaport said that 
NYMEX's investment bankers advised a private placement first, in part because 
of recent stock market jitters, and to capitalize on the 128-year-old 
exchange's unique story and build credibility for a market offering. The 
NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately. 
But plenty of potential investors have queued up. Among others, NYMEX has 
open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange, an Internet-based 
trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was 
launched earlier this year, deciding then on the solo route. "The deal that 
was offered was then, and still today looking back on it, was unacceptable," 
he said. "That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental 
Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today. "We would very 
much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange. And I will 
tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest." 
Intercontinental Exchange this summer started over-the-counter trade in gold 
and silver and plans to open up Web-based dealing in energy products in the 
fourth quarter. Backing it are some of the world's top oil companies and 
banks, including BP Amoco Plc. , Royal Dutch/Shell Group Goldman Sachs and 
Deutsche Bank AG . Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for 
listing shares was a "double edged sword" for NYMEX. "The fact that dot-coms, 
and e-commerce in general, don't have the momentum that they had six months 
ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has e-commerce as a 
material part of its valuation," he said. But he said no competitor was 
better positioned than NYMEX. NYMEX has linked up with Platts, a division of 
publishers McGraw-Hill, for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software 
applications company Kiodex Inc. to provide a trade engine for the order 
matching system. But these have no equity stakes. Rappaport said any desire 
to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass 
was balanced against NYMEX's condition that it maintain market neutrality. 
"We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of 
companies," he said. "Having market neutrality will be critical to any 
platform's long-term success." Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX, which was 
first to start in the third quarter this year, was not now placing it at a 
disadvantage against up-and-running over-the-counter platforms like 
Intercontinental, which could yet be its main worry. "If Intercontinental 
launches and clears futures than we're talking about a whole different 
competitive landscape," he said. "The fact that Intercontinental has put 
together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view 
them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that 
road." NYMEX will begin e-trade with energy futures, leaving to a later date 
gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper and aluminum in part because it has 
yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEX's COMEX metals division over 
the right to trade those electronically during New York hours. "We believe we 
can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX member's 
interests and to the exchange's interests," he said. "But to the extent that 
we can't, I don't view that has having any significant impact on either the 
private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue." For now, Rappaport does 
not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaur-like behind LIFFE traders 
out the door. "The challenge for the U.S. exchanges, those that have a 
history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a 
way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces. "I see it 
almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in 
the liquidity chain, for certain products. We've already gone wholly 
electronic in electricity."

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

On Saturday, we received the consent required from the lenders to serve 
Preliminary Termination Notices (PTNs) on MSEB under the PPA.  The consent 
allows us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian 
counterparts to date.  We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for 
future bad acts.

On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts 
under the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA.  There are a few more 
PTNs that will be served on MSEB in early June -- the underlying defaults for 
these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and these 
notices were served in early April.

Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he 
receives 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his 
apartment.  On Sunday, our service of the PTNs was the lead story in all 4 
newspapers.

After three and a half years as CFO Enron Europe, Paul Chivers has decided to 
move on from the Global Finance Group and is considering commercial 
assignments within Enron both here in Europe and in Houston. Paul has made a 
significant contribution to Enron's European business in building a team that 
consistently delivers financing for our transactions. We wish him every 
success in the future.

Effective immediately, Anne Edgley will assume the position of CFO Europe. 
Please join us in welcoming her to this new role.

Philippe spotted this too today and has asked Steve Horn to pursue.   We may 
want to involve Robert in this from the employment perspective.

Good spot though.

I raised the issue of ENW considering the purchase of a tech consulting firm 
at a staff meeting several weeks ago.  Attached please find a quick and dirty 
analysis of some of the key players.  You may note that Luminant is trading 
below $1.  Please let me know if anyone is actively pursuing this 
"intellectual capital" opportunity.

All the best,

Enform expands Sun Micro partnership
HOUSTON, Dec. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Enform technology, a high-tech 
consultant, said it has expanded the company's strategic partnership with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. Privately held Enform said Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun 
Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator 
technology called iForce eIntegrators, for use in creating Web applications 
and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform 
build its service offerings and create custom consulting services, which will 
be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not 
clear, and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. 
Enform, which is run by John McNevin, a former partner at Ernst & Young, has 
grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps 
businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new 
technologies they need to remain competitive. Since its inception, Enform has 
apparently been profitable. It hasn't needed any venture capital to operate. 
The company has about 200 employees, with branch offices in Dallas and 
Austin, and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform 
recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in 
sales next year, if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft 
Corp., Engage Energy and Continental Airlines.

Please be advised that, through the distribution of this email, Global 
Finance is adding the following language to the Roseville FASH dated May 9, 
2001:

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and 
pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested 
for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of 
these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, 
thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  
Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be 
requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this 
DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure 
which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

The EES VaR for today is $8.2 million, up from yesterday's Var of $5.0 
million, due to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio at NP 
and SP.   The VaR will decrease once the short positions that were recently 
added to cover the University of California system deal are removed due to 
EES' successful appeal.

Let's talk! 

Hey Greg! It was terrific seeing you and Mary at the wedding (thought I wish 
I had spent more time talking to Mary). Now that I'm back in the office, I 
thought I'd send you this invitation to talk.  In theory, as long as you are 
using Windows, it should work, though I've had recent reports of some 
problems with Netscape.  When you get a mic and you think I might be on-line 
at work, just click the link below, agree to the certificate, and we should 
be connected. If it doesn't work, I'll have to call you to walk you through a 
demo of our other stuff. Let me know. Take care, Henri P.S.  Ulrich is still 
so *serious*!

A near term goal for mid/back office commercialization is as follows:

First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that 
can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces.  In 
other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we 
put it at Enron.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power 
scheduling at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or 
financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net 
Works.

Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a 
systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is 
straightforward)?

Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other 
parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP 
system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical 
settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, 
etc.  All the linkages.

Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines 
payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies 
as well.

Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.

Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's 
meeting).

Finally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.

I know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time 
schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the 
following format:

A draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a 
clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a 
recommendation on how Enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger 
as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in Enron and how 
those functions work with ProcessCo.

Sheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump are 
now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back office 
experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom 
comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.

Let's discuss Monday.

Thanks.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.

Thanks for your reply.  We certainly can appreciate the importance of focus
and not being able to devote cycles to activities which are not core.  We'll
keep you up to date with our progress and perhaps the time will be right in
the future.

Frank-

Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.? Unfortunately,
business
is such that at this time we do not have the resources to allocate for
someone to focus on your worthy effort.? It really is interesting, but
we
just have our hands full on a variety of new initiatives that are much
bigger in scope.? Basically, just bad timing.

Best of luck to you and your team in your efforts to bring some
efficiency
to this market.? If there still is opportunity at the beginning of next
year, please contact me.? Maybe we will have better luck then.

Regards,

Jeff McMahon

   Jeff and Greg:

   Echoing Jason's message from last week, we enjoyed

   meeting you very much.? With this email I would like

   to follow up on comments you made regarding a possible

   investment that would allow FairAir to serve in a

   market-making role.

   As detailed in the attached presentation, we propose

   that Enron invest $3.5 million for 17% of our company

   as the lead investor in a $6 million round.? These funds

   would let us deploy $2 million toward market-making

   and grow our business over 12 months to the point

   where we are generating $250k in monthly profits.

   (Our projections are detailed in the attached

   spreadsheet.)

   FairAir is the industry's best hope for the creation of

   a true travel market down the road.? Now that our system

   is operational, we are poised for growth.? As we discussed,

   Northwest has verbally committed to expanding from seven

   trial markets to their full route system.? Additionally,

   in direct conversations with American and Continental,

   we received a strong indication that an investment from

   Enron would tip the balance in our favor.

   I will call you the morning of Monday, March 26th to

   follow up on this email.

   Regards,

   Frank

Subject: delainey discussions

highlights of my discussion with dave:
? he wants an "opportunity" to originate out of the ees positions.  for 
example, the harrah's deal generated approximately $16 million relative to 
the mid, of which $4 went to ees.  he wants a chance to back this deal with 
his sourcing group.
? he was unable to offer any definition around what the word "opportunity" 
means.  one interpretation of "opportunity" is that they get a head start, 
say three months to back a deal where neither west mm or west orig works on 
that deal for three months.  another interpretation is that west mm and west 
orig aren't allowed to talk to certain wholesale customers, for example the 
generators.  both of these are bad ideas.
? i asked him why enron would want to keep its most talented origination 
resources on the sidelines for any period of time in order to let the kid 
brother (ees) have a "fair" chance at winning a deal.  i also asked him if he 
thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have 
developed in the west.  his answer was no.
? i told dave that as the manager of the retail risk book i don't care who 
originates out of the transaction.  my thinking is that i give a copy of the 
harrah's contract to calger, foster, and delainey.  whoever gets us out first 
gets paid orig.  if people want to coordinate then that's fine.  if they want 
to compete head to head then that's fine.  speaking for portland, i would 
expect that west mm and orig would coordinate.
? dave then said that he "gave" us the risk function and insinuated that we 
owed him something in return.  i indicated that i was willing to give it back 
and return to my simple life managing the west wholesale trading desk if 
that's what he wanted.  i think he took offense to that comment.
? we hung up with no resolution.  dave called me back and proposed that we 
let anyone originate out of the position.  however, the origination dollars 
would go to ees profit center with the west mm or origination person getting 
the credit for that.  he talked about ees and the stock price and the billion 
dollar business.  my guys (i'm not speaking for chris here) don't care where 
the origination dollars go to so long as they get paid for bringing value.
? i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for 
direction from you.

i'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are 
in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward.  i would say that we 
agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals.  i 
would rather that the money for orig stay with whoever originated it.  i can 
live with a variety of outcomes.  i'll sit tight and wait for direction from 
you.

 Hi Greg --

 The auction will take place tomorrow using WRH's OpenBook system.
This is a significant
 milestone for WR Hambrecht. We will be working with Goldman Sachs
going forward, and I thought
 it would be great if we could set up a meeting with Andrew Fastow
and Ben Glisan in the near future
 to tell the OpenBook story. Please let me know if you would be the
person to make the request
 on our behalf or if it is appropriate for me to call them directly.

 Hope things are great with you.

      Head, Marketing

 p.s. If you or Liz could be in touch re setting up a meeting, I'd
really appreciate it. We have plans
     to be in Texas a couple of times in June and we would like to
try to add Enron to the top of the list.

 <<CSFB_EnergyTech_May1701.pdf>>


Summary:

* U.S. President George W. Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy
today.  In our report we list the recommendations made by the National
Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD) as they pertain to Renewable and
Alternative Energy.  In addition, following each recommendation, we provide
our views on the potential impacts on specific CSFB covered companies
(AstroPower - APWR, Ballard Power Systems - BLDP, Capstone Turbine - CPST,
FuelCell Energy - FCEL, Proton Energy Systems - PRTN) in the Energy
Technology sector.
* We would note that many of the recommendations instruct certain
departments or individuals to conduct further research on various topics and
to report back to the President at a later date.  Our view is that many were
included as a counter point to more contentious issues and may receive
somewhat limited action from the Administration.
* Overall, we are not changing our estimates or recommendations on any
of our companies at this point in time.  The proposed solar tax credit
when/if passed will cause us to review our forecasts for AstroPower.  We are
not forecasting incremental unit volume of production given the capacity
constraint of the company, although residential installations tend to have a
higher revenue per watt and higher margins than non-residential markets and
therefore could result in higher EPS contribution.

GE Global Plans Railroad Exchange Site
The Washington Post 

Can online commerce help rail companies save money on locomotives and boxcars?

Gaithersburg-based GE Global eXchange Services will announce today the Global 
Rail Exchange, which aims to facilitate just such purchases.
The Internet-based business-to-business exchange, which has been in testing 
for three months with some of the largest buyers and sellers of railroad 
equipment, officially opens for business today with the goal of serving as 
the online marketplace for trade of all the goods used by railroads.

By bringing diffuse manufacturers and buyers together into one exchange, the 
company hopes to offer an attractive proposition to each side, said Otto 
Kumbar, the vice president of interchange solutions at GE Global eXchange 
Services.

Suppliers have joined to get access to more potential buyers, while buyers 
have joined to pit suppliers against one another in pursuit of the lowest 
possible price for components of railroad systems.

Global Rail Exchange, despite starting well after the crest of the wave in 
business-to-business start-ups, claims several advantages. It is run by a 
wholly owned division of General Electric Co., giving it clout in the 
marketplace, and already has 700 companies as users, including some of the 
biggest names in the railroad industry such as Amtrak, Norfolk Southern Corp. 
and CSX Corp.

The company aims to bring liquidity to the market for rail industry supplies, 
and to cut transaction costs by conducting them online and profit through 
subscription fees, as well as collecting a transaction fee for each completed 
sale.

Kumbar claims that in the initial tests with customers, suppliers saved an 
average of 10 to 25 percent on costs normally associated with selling their 
goods.
Many online exchanges have had trouble gaining a foothold this year, as 
innumerable start-ups have set up--often in the same market--and many have 
yet to complete their first transaction or are struggling to generate profits.
"I think the key to our exchange is making sure you have a return on 
investment for all buyers and suppliers," Kumbar said. "We have that."

Any thoughts on them- quality of management, ability to execute their
aggressive growth in production capacity? Also, how much of a haircut
are they due from California exposure?

We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&L, 
positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit.  In 
accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible 
breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business 
Units.

This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the 
name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of 
granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to 
all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit 
Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business 
unit.

Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.

Thank you

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a 
press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed 
agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to 
renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long 
term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of 
litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris

FYI.  Contract analysis is beginning to proceed.  Just though you would want 
periodic updates, but these guys are beginning to take ownership which is a 
good thing.

Recapped below is the latest list of team participants based on the feedback 
provided.  I highlighted those that attended the kick-off meeting today.  Are 
the others still to be contacted, or is this the complete team?

There was some discussion at the meeting as to whether we needed to move 
these people to a separate cost center.  Berney is following up, but in the 
meantime I will get one set up as part of Don and Rogers' organization moves 
and we can populate it later if we want to.

Thanks

At 1pm Houston time today, Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) will announce that 
he is switching from the Republican Party to become an Independent voting 
with the Democrats.  If this happens, control of the Senate will switch to 
the Democrats, which will give the Dems a majority and control of the 
Senate.  

? All committee chairs would become Democratic and the Dems would control the 
legislative agenda
 ( Energy bills, California bailout, possible investigation of who influenced 
the Cheney plan etc.).  In a profound ideological  shift, Sen. Murkowski (R- 
AK) would be replaced by Sen. Bingaman (D-NM) as chair of the Senate Energy 
Committee

? The recommendations for loosening regulations for oil/gas drilling, coal 
and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the Cheney 
bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation-oriented 
measures.

? The tax bill will likely be downsized, particularly if Jeffords makes his 
switch immediately.  The timing is important because the Senate-House 
conference on the bill must be appointed immediately.

? All presidential appointments would be controlled by the Dems.  This is 
significant because of the large number of sub-cabinet level appointments 
that need to be approved.

At the same time, Republicans are trying to convince Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA), 
who already votes Republican, to switch to the Republican party.  If this 
happens, it will cancel out the expected Jeffords move.  Initial reports are 
that Miller will not switch.

One other caveat -- Jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then 
flaked out.  But if Jeffords goes through with it and Miller stays put, the 
balance of power in Washington will be tipped in favor of the Democrats.

Stilwell Lost $1.7 Billion/Day in Nov.Stilwell Lost $1.7 Billion/Day in Nov=
.=20

By Christopher Noble

BOSTON (Reuters) - Janus Capital's parent, Stilwell Financial Inc. (NYSE:SV=
 -=20
news), saw its assets shrink nearly $2 billion a day in November as the=20
hottest technology fund firm of the 1990s was hit by sharp market declines.

Stilwell reported on Friday it had $262 billion under management at the end=
=20
of November -- a $38 billion plunge from the $300 billion at the end of=20
October. That works out to a huge $1.73 billion for each trading day, most =
of=20
it directly from Janus, which is 82.5 percent owned by Stilwell.

Much of the shrinkage is attributable to the dizzying drop of the Nasdaq,=
=20
which logged a 23 percent decline in November, its second-worst fall ever.=
=20
Only October 1987, the month of the stock market crash when Nasdaq lost 27=
=20
percent, was worse.

The Dow Jones Industrial average, with much less exposure to technology, fe=
ll=20
only 5.1 percent in November.

``The decline in assets under management has infinitely more to do with=20
market depreciation than it does with investor redemptions,'' said Jane=20
Ingalls, spokeswoman for Janus.

She declined to give specific figures for monthly net cash flow, but said=
=20
November was shaping up much like September and October, when redemptions=
=20
from Janus retail funds were offset by inflows through its institutional=20
channels.

``We were very squarely positive in September,'' she said. ''In October, we=
=20
had modest outflows on the retail side, but they were offset almost entirel=
y=20
by institutional flows.''

Janus had retail outflows of $772 million in October after September net=20
redemptions of $46 million. September was the first time since December 199=
7=20
that Janus had net outflows.

``For November, it is still a little early to tell,'' she said. ``But again=
,=20
it's looking like modest outflows on the retail side and either flat or=20
slightly negative on the institutional side.''

A shrinking asset base is just the latest bump in the road the once sleepy=
=20
fund firm traveled in the 1990s. It has endured an acrimonious dispute with=
=20
its former parent, Kansas City Southern Industries, over a spinoff plan and=
=20
its funds have been punished as investors soured on the tech and growth=20
sectors that are heavily favored by Janus portfolio managers.

Of Janus's 16 retail equity funds, 14 are in negative territory year-to-dat=
e=20
and all of them lost ground in November, according to data from fund tracke=
r=20
Morningstar.

But recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (news - web=
=20
sites) show Janus has stuck with its investments and has not changed its=20
investment style.

Stilwell also includes the Berger fund family, Nelson Money Managers Plc an=
d=20
a stake in DST Systems Inc.

Stilwell is not alone to suffer from investor hesitancy in recent months.

Preliminary estimates from TrimTabs, a firm that tracks money flowing in an=
d=20
out of the stock market, show $4.5 billion of new money flowed into mutual=
=20
funds in November, the lowest figure for the year and the smallest since=20
February 1999, when inflows were $758 million.

The estimate excludes activity on Nov. 30 and is based on actual data from =
20=20
percent of the industry. TrimTabs extrapolates overall flows from its sampl=
e.

The money still went heavily to technology and small capitalization funds,=
=20
indicating a surprisingly resilient enthusiasm for the sectors, Wittnebert=
=20
said.

``The thing the public is really afraid of is missing a resumption of the=
=20
rally of the Nasdaq and another indication of that is the continuing outflo=
w=20
from bond funds,'' he said.=20

HoustonStreet Weaves New Round of Investments And Strategic Partnerships
Into Its `web for the Web'

03/23/2000
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

  PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2000--


  Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient, Bowstreet and others bring financial,
marketing and B2B Internet savvy to Web-based wholesale
  energy exchange


  Taking another step toward becoming the Internet-based energy trading
leader, HoustonStreet Exchange today announced a new round of investments and
strategic relationships with key experts. Thomas H. Lee Company, Sapient and
Bowstreet have all joined HoustonStreet's web for the Web, a virtual network
of business and technology companies that support HoustonStreet's delivery of
wholesale energy trading platforms.

  HoustonStreet established the web for the Web business model as a
rapid-development network of strategic partnerships with companies that have
expertise in disparate fields, rather than building its own departments
in-house. Leveraging the core competencies of its key partners, HoustonStreet
is able to execute quickly and effectively in a rapidly changing environment.
After helping HoustonStreet launch its company and its wholesale power trading
exchange, HoustonStreet.com, these businesses are now helping the company
improve the exchange and expand it aggressively into additional markets.

  Thomas H. Lee Company, one of the oldest, largest and most successful
private equity investment firms in the country with more than $6 billion in
total capital under management, will provide HoustonStreet with important
financial advisement and significant contacts to help the company expand.

  "HoustonStreet has a great Internet exchange platform and stands alone in
its ability to give energy traders the information they need within an
easy-to-use, fluid trading environment," said Tom Hagerty, managing director
at Thomas H. Lee Company. "We believe online energy trading will grow
dramatically in the months and years ahead, and HoustonStreet is well
positioned to seize this opportunity."

  In addition to Thomas H. Lee Company, leading technology companies Sapient
and Bowstreet, private equity investment firms Omega Advisors, Inc. and
Elliott Associates, L.P., and principals from MicroArts Corporation
participated in this round of financing. Sapient, Bowstreet and MicroArts all
play integral roles in HoustonStreet's Web-driven business model, and will
continue to help the company respond to market demand in Internet time.
HoustonStreet Exchange relied on Sapient's strategic and systems integration
experience to design and build the site. MicroArts developed the user
interface, interactive marketing Web site, and marketing plan for the site's
launch. Bowstreet is working with HoustonStreet.com to develop the platform
for HoustonStreet to provide additional value-added services to its customers
and to link trading information directly to trading companies' mid- and
back-office systems using XML (Extensible Markup Language) technology. This
will allow risk managers to have a real-time view of trading activity.

  "These relationships demonstrate the strength of our web for the Web," said
HoustonStreet president and CEO Frank Getman. "We pride ourselves on working
with the best and brightest in their particular areas of expertise who share
our commitment to execution and success. Omega, Elliott and Thomas H. Lee
bring financial and Wall Street expertise, while Sapient, Bowstreet and
MicroArts provide us with the technology and marketing savvy that have given
us a leadership position in the market."

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

The EES VaR for today is $14.0 million, up from $11.1 million yesterday, due 
to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The VaR will 
decrease once the short positions associated with the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Energy Co-opportunity (ECO) and Capstone have entered into a
contractual relationship whereby ECO will be a preferred provider of and
will offer Capstone's 30kW microturbine unit to the electric cooperative
industry.  The contract also calls for the purchase of 76 units, which ECO
believes will sell rapidly given the interest indicated by its customers.
* Dublin, Ireland-based power developer Eirtricity is considering the
development of what would be the world's largest wind farm.  The 500 MW wind
farm would see a combination of land and offshore-based wind turbines,
likely in County Wicklow.
* Calpine c*Power, a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation, and AFS
Trinity have entered into a strategic partnership that will see Calpine
c*Power market AFS' flywheel products as a component of its Reliable Power
Systems that are designed to serve datacom ports.

Sure.  Confidentially, CSFB has the IPO.  Morgan Stanley is quietly handling 
some select acquisition inquiries.  I mentioned Enron and they didn't see why 
you'd want to look - so I offered to find out.  I think you'd be impressed by 
the CEO.

You can email me or call me at 310.201.4117.  I'm traveling Monday but always 
reachable.  Happy Turkey Day.

Larry

i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks 
and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, 
international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book 
this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that 
bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time 
i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out?

o Crosspoint Confirms It is Delaying $1 Billion Fund

WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Crosspoint Venture Partners
confirmed reports that it has postponed its ninth
fund, which had commitments totaling over $1 billion.
The company cited the dip in the stock market; market
congestion for young companies; and a concern that
good companies will have a hard time in the current
market as the main reasons for the postponement.
The firm said it wants to make sure it generates
returns its limited partners are used to getting.
Crosspoint said there is enough money in its $854
million 2000 fund to finance a few new companies
should it see fit, but will now mainly focus on
bringing its existing young companies to profitability.
The firm said it plans to continue with the fund
at an undetermined point in the future and expects
that its committed limited partners will continue
with the firm.

o Crosspoint Confirms It is Delaying $1 Billion Fund

WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Crosspoint Venture Partners
confirmed reports that it has postponed its ninth
fund, which had commitments totaling over $1 billion.
The company cited the dip in the stock market; market
congestion for young companies; and a concern that
good companies will have a hard time in the current
market as the main reasons for the postponement.
The firm said it wants to make sure it generates
returns its limited partners are used to getting.
Crosspoint said there is enough money in its $854
million 2000 fund to finance a few new companies
should it see fit, but will now mainly focus on
bringing its existing young companies to profitability.
The firm said it plans to continue with the fund
at an undetermined point in the future and expects
that its committed limited partners will continue
with the firm.

True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity 
groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity "cut".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a "flag", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
"institutional memory".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid 
office groups)

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Greg,
 I am a '95 grad now working with EECC after five years of being an armor 
officer.  I just recently made my transition and I am exploring what 
direction I would like to take within the corporate arena.  I  was wondering 
if you could take some time to share some information about your business 
unit, experiences, and any suggestions you may have for someone in my 
situation.   I hope to hear from you soon.

Happy Holidays!

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your
independence, effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties
over
all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she
does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP,
for the
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world
outside
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for
further elections.

Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be
circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following
rules
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Then
look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed
at

just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.  Generally, you  should
raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up "vocabulary".
Using the
same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as  "like"
and "you
know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of  communication.  Look
up
"interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know
on
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.
It
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the
good guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The
Queen",
but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get
confused and give up half way through.

6. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for
your
own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand what we
mean.

7. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

 Thank you for your cooperation.

Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some 
typos.



Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

IP, Georgia-Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser
   launch on-line marketplace

   PURCHASE, N.Y., ATLANTA, and FEDERAL WAY, Wash., March
   23, 2000 (PRNewswire) - International Paper, Georgia-Pacific
   Corp. and Weyerhaeuser Co. today jointly announced that they
   intend to develop a global business-to-business marketplace to
   enable buying and selling of paper and forest products on-line.

   The companies will take a leadership role to facilitate the utilization
   of Internet technology to enhance service to customers and
   increase efficiency with suppliers. The electronic marketplace will
   create a foundation for common industry standards to simplify and
   accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce across the
   industry.

   The marketplace will operate as an independent entity with its own
   board of directors and management team. Initially, the three
   founding companies will each have an equal equity position, but it is
   expected that more partners will join the initiative. Based on
   demonstrated success, the companies will consider taking the
   entity public.

   The paper and forest products industry in the United States ships
   more than $200 billion worth of products annually. By working
   together to establish an electronic marketplace, the three leading
   companies in the industry believe they can benefit customers by
   simplifying transaction processes, improving information flow and
   increasing speed of delivery, thereby reducing costs. Providing
   both procurement and sales functions means the on-line
   marketplace will also enable participating companies to streamline
   purchasing operations, reduce inventories, cut internal costs and
   increase capital efficiency in the industry.

   The three companies immediately will begin conducting a search
   for a chief executive officer for the new operation and are assessing
   potential technology partners to add state-of-the-art expertise to the
   enterprise. The companies plan to promptly complete a definitive
   agreement, finalize a business plan and enlist additional strategic
   partners, including forest products companies and affiliated industry
   firms.

   John T. Dillon, International Paper's chairman and chief executive
   officer, said, "This is a substantial commitment on the part of three
   industry leaders to develop a comprehensive electronic
   marketplace for the forest and paper sector. As manufacturers,
   marketers and distributors of a broad array of products, we will
   collectively bring expertise and resources to this effort."

   A.D. "Pete" Correll, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive
   officer, said, "This is a bold move for the paper and forest products
   industry. It is a defining step in our industry's positioning in the
   electronic business-to-business marketplace. Our companies
   immediately bring products and distribution capability through our
   active, joint participation." 

   Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's chairman, president and chief
   executive, said, "Rapidly evolving technology is dramatically
   changing the global marketplace. This initiative will aggressively
   shape the electronic marketplace in the paper and forest products
   industry to ensure our industry meets the current and future needs of
   our customers. It will also promote better relationships with other
   trade partners, such as suppliers." 

   Executives representing the three companies who will serve as a
   steering committee include Marianne M. Parrs, executive vice
   president, International Paper; and John N. Balboni, vice president -
   e-business, International Paper; David J. Paterson, vice president -
   electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Robert A. Renner,
   director - electronic commerce, Georgia-Pacific; and Mack L.
   Hogans, senior vice president - corporate affairs with acting
   responsibility for electronic business, Weyerhaeuser; and Darien E.
   Roseen, vice president, strategic planning, Weyerhaeuser. Morgan
   Stanley Dean Witter has been selected to provide financial
   consulting services for this initiative.

   Until the electronic marketplace is up and running, which is subject
   to appropriate governmental and other approvals, the companies
   will continue to conduct sales and procurement activities as normal.
   International Paper's previously announced relationship with
   PaperExchange.com will remain part of the company's
   e-commerce strategy.

   International Paper is the world's largest paper and forest products
   company. Businesses include printing papers, packaging, building
   materials, chemical products and distribution. Headquartered in the
   United States at Purchase, N.Y., International Paper has operations
   in nearly 50 countries, employs nearly 100,000 people and exports
   its products to more than 130 nations.

   Georgia-Pacific, headquartered at Atlanta, is one of the world's
   leading manufacturers and distributors of pulp, paper and building
   products. It consists of two distinct operating groups -- The
   Georgia-Pacific Group, which includes the pulp, paper and building
   products businesses, and The Timber Company, which manages
   4.7 million acres of timberland in North America. The company
   employs more than 55,000 people at 500 locations in the United
   States and Canada.

   Weyerhaeuser Company, one of the world's largest integrated
   forest products companies, was incorporated in 1900. In 1999,
   sales were $12.3 billion. It has offices or operations in 13 countries,
   with customers worldwide. Weyerhaeuser is principally engaged in
   the growing and harvesting of timber; the manufacture, distribution
   and sale of forest products; and real estate construction,
   development and related activities.

Greg-

I interviewed this morning with for a logistics job with the bandwidth 
trading group, Paul Racicot's.

After my qualifications for the job were established, I mentioned to him that 
we were in the Army
together in Germany.  He asked me if you could attest for my performance at 
the time and I told
him "yes."  Although in a previous life, I sure hope you remember me and the 
great job I did 
maintaining L Troop's readiness, repair parts inventory, and maintenance 
records throughout all
all those border mission, gunneries, ARTEPs, etc.  As a reminder, L Troop 
always excelled on the
inspections and supplied repair parts to the other units.....Ben Bergfelt 
should definitely remember
how good I made him and L Troop look!

I apologize if I was out of line mentioning your name, only after my 
qualifications had been established,
but as CALME shuts down I am looking for a job.

I have attached my resume just in case you have a better job for me.

Regards,
Antonio
