Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Please click on the link below.

Name:             DEBRA PERLINGIERE
Personnel number: P00503676
Phone:            7138537658

If you have questions about electronic pay stubs, please contact Janice Priddy (Payroll) 713-853-7839 or Marie Newhouse (ClickAtHome) at 713-345-4185 or send an email to  Enron.Payroll@enron.com (Enron Payroll in Outlook).

Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Debra,
Do you mind if we make the effective date December 1, 2001?  We've done quite a
few deals under this contract in October and I don't want to have to process new
confirms for this past business.  Additionally, by the time we route the
amendment through our organization, get it signed and back to you, and then
Enron does the same thing, we could be looking at the same problem in November.
Using a 12/1/01 effective date should allow sufficient time for execution by
both sides and getting our systems updated.
Thanks,
Jim

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

Kim Clausen has agreed, on behalf of the above referenced company, to have the GISB contract amended to designate ENA as confirming party.  Details are as follows:

Contract #: 96020382
E-mail:KClausen@mitchellgs.com
Phone: (713) 377-7090
Fax: (713) 377-6728

Please, if possible, give this amendment priority.  It is one of the "major problem counterparties" we discussed in the meeting.

Let me know if there is any way I can assist.

Thanks,

Ann

Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.  
 
Thanks,

Thanks so much for your patience and understanding on this matter,

Troy, can you call Jill Mearz with TIE and get the same contract information for Gerald. Please forward the information to Gerald as well. Jill (972) 455-2980

Gerald, we are bidding on gas for several IPP's with this company. They are wanting to get a copy of our contract ASAP to begin the initial review process. When Troy forwards you the contract information what would be the turn around for a hard copy and email I could send them.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

If you would, please send the confirm.  

Two additions:

1.  I think that the language for the pricing should include "less applaicable gathering and processing fees incurred by the Buyer, including those fees charged by Gatherco, Inc.".

2.  The Pipeline for Mtr 717457 is Gatherco, Inc.

Hey, lady,

I just got back from eating on 2.  I grabbed a table and looked for you the entire time, but didn't see you.  Then I got your message.  Where were you?

Let's try it again soon.

Debra, 

My contact said on the first page of the contract he would like "cover" checked, not "spot" as it now appears.    

That is the last revision requested and if you agree, it should bring this deal to closure.

Debra,

My contact at LG&E has requested the default pricing in the contract be switched from "spot" to some type of "true-cost" verbiage.  His point was that if he is buying 10,000 on a given day from Enron and ENA only delivers 5,000 by the terms of the present contract Enron would be responsible for the "spot" cost of replacement gas or the gas daily average for that zone.  My contact points out that the market for gas when this purchase is to take place could be significantly higher (or lower) than gas daily and that is the cost they want to pay or receive.  

Is something like this request possible?

 FYI, I have started negotiations with LG&E, however they have not resolved the issue of party name(s) on their part.   I will keep you apprised of my progress.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Coming up this week at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology:

Thursday, January 31, 6:00 PM
EXPLORE AFGHANISTAN
 Learn about the landscape, history, people and ethnicities of Afghanistan
with former BBC journalist and translator Mr. Ahmad Shafi.  Originally,
this program was to present Mr. Abdullah Ayazi, "The Map Man", but he had
to cancel, and sends his apologies.  Mr. Shafi is his colleague and
co-presenter and is perhaps even better qualified to speak about the
current situation as well as the history.  He began working for the BBC at
age 15, translating, escorting correspondents to the front lines, and
arranging interviews with government officials.  He became a journalist in
his own right, and has also worked with Healthnet International on refugee
issues.  Maxwell Museum North Gallery.  Refreshments will be served.  Mr.
Ayazi's maps will be available.

Debra,

Kim Clausen has agreed, on behalf of the above referenced company, to have the GISB contract amended to designate ENA as confirming party.  Details are as follows:

Contract #: 96020382
E-mail:KClausen@mitchellgs.com
Phone: (713) 377-7090
Fax: (713) 377-6728

Please, if possible, give this amendment priority.  It is one of the "major problem counterparties" we discussed in the meeting.

Let me know if there is any way I can assist.

Thanks,

Ann

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.  As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.  I'll ask them to send us a draft.

Call me when you get a chance.

thanks

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

Thanks so much!  What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron?

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.

the

>
> Then I saw it.  The title bore "People I Have Shared the Gospel With."
> The handle was brighter than those around it, newer,

Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation. 



Thanks

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Debra,

We need to change the pricing verbage. The price should not be 80% of IFHSC. The price for 80% of the volume is IFHSC - .075. Also, the price for the other 20% of the volume is GD - .065 and we should clarify that the GD is Houston Ship Channel. The new well pricing should also be HSC GD - .065. 

Also, I just want to clarify that this pricing is only effective as of January 1, 2002 through the end of the new term. It does not replace or restate the original pricing from the original effective date to the end of 2001. Based on the "replaces and restates" and the "effective date through December 31, 2001" wording, I was not sure. The other changes are effective from the contract effective date, but not the pricing.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me know if you need further information or if we need to discuss.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

Scott,

Here are some of the comments that we have to the redline version of the Enfolio Master you sent us.  I will designate them by the section number they are assigned in the Master.  Also, there are a few items that we are waiting on our credit department to resolve.  Initially, I would like to clarify some of the basics of the agreement.  Do you anticipate being the buyer or the seller more often under this agreement?  Where is the delivery point?  

All changes from Texas to New York law are acceptable.  

2.2  Why do you want to strike the language "and acknowledge that each Party will rely thereon in doing business related to the Transaction"?

2.3 This change is acceptable

2.4  We agree that the change from "may" to "shall", but don't agree to striking the reasonable time for reciept.  Would it be more acceptable to change this to "Two Business Days"?

3.1  This change is acceptable

3.2 and 3.4  We would like to hold off on these items until for now.

4.1  The changes in this section are acceptable, save the last change which strikes the langauge dealing with affiliates.  We are waiting on credit to ensure that this last change is acceptable.

4.2  This language is not acceptable as we find the language already provided in the Master to be satisfactory.  The clause already makes reference to "material" representations

Article 5  You propose to take out the language limiting Force Majeure to 60 days.  Is it your intention that Force Majeure can continue indefinetly?  If not, what time period do you suggest?

6.2  Why do you want to take this section out?  Who will be responsible should new taxes be levied?

7.1  The first change in this paragraph, "as the Gas passes the receiving manifold..." is acceptable.  However, the second change, which allows the parties to take negligence into consideration in determining indemnity, is not acceptable.

8.2  The first change is acceptable.   However the language disallowing the parties to transfer, sell, encumber, or assign the Agreement for security purposes is unacceptable.  As for the obligation of a transferring party, we agree that the parties should remain liable on contracts transferred to an affiliate of the company and for transactions which have not been completed.  However, in all other scenarios, the parties should not be liable.

8.3  These changes are unacceptable.  If you could explain your reasoning for the change, perhaps we could reach some middle ground.  

8.4 Would it be more to your liking to change the 60 day requirement to 30 days?

8.9  Could you explain your reasons for the deletion of the language in this section.  The first two sentences and the last sentence added by you are acceptable, however the remaining portions are unacceptable.


If you have any questions regarding these comments, please refer them to Debra Perlingeire.  Here telephone numer is 713-853-7658 and her email is dperlin@enron.com.  

Best regards,

Alisha Mahabir

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=

Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Subject:	Counterparties

All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks,

Here is the link to the GISB, however trade has been terminated on this agreement as it was assigned last year to HPL prior to the sale.  Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTION OF 2002 WENH BOARD

Dear Members:

The  annual meeting of the Women's Energy Network of Houston is normally
held at the November or December luncheon meeting.  This year, however, WENH 
held two out-of-the-ordinary events in November and December that precluded
the annual meeting from being held in those months.  WENH's bylaws provide
that "if the December meeting is not held, the annual meeting shall be held
at the next WENH meeting."  Accordingly, the WENH Board of Directors has
scheduled the annual meeting to be held at our January luncheon meeting at
Brennan's Restaurant, 3300 Smith St., on January 9, 2002, at 12:00 p.m.

At the annual meeting, the WENH membership in attendance will elect the
Officers and Directors of the WENH Board of Directors for 2002.  No WENH
member may vote by proxy.  Following careful deliberation of all nominated
candidates, the Nominating Committee, composed of Leesa Foster, President;
Robin Dyer, Immediate Past President; Lisa Craig, Vice President and
retiring Board member; Meg Healy, WENH member; and Karyl Lawson, WEHN member
(with Denise Cassata, WENH member, as a substitute at the Nominating
Committee's final meeting) hereby announces its recommended slate for the
upcoming elections at the annual meeting, as follows:

2002 WENH Board Nominations


POSITION			NOMINATION

President 			Tammy Naron				

Vice President			Tammy Dowe

Secretary	  		Mary Wilson

Treasurer			Tammy Norman

No, as most of this sounds like it will be done on the back-end, what you will probably need to tell people is that instead of emailing to the address you have been giving them, email instead to Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com. It will get routed automatically.

I wanted to make sure you saw this, I think you are going to have to start using Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com now otherwise your mail will start getting non-deliveries. I'll confirm with the messaging group but it sounds like your first instincts were right.

Subject:	UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses


Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :		Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?

Debra,
Can you please make sure that this the right form of resale. I think the document that we prefer has 3 signature lines for ICC, ENA and Resale Counterparty. Any guidance you can give Cassandra and I is most appreciated. Thanks for the help.

Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

I assume your are refering to the deal where he bought back his position even though the deals looks like a sale.  I am not sure why he would need to sign.  This deals converted a fixed deal back to an index deal.

Subject:	Kenoil


 The confirmation for the July -Oct transaction with Kenoil has not been signed.   Mr. Flecher does not think he needs to sign this?  Are we purchasing gas? I will resend the confirm to him for signature unless you tell me otherwise.

Also, please remember to advise regarding volumes for the last agreements you sent.

Thanks

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

I work in the Legal Department for Lisa Herrmann at RWE Trading Americas
Inc.  I am trying to find out the correct legal name of your company
that would enter into a natural gas purchase/sales contract and a power
purchase/sale contract.  Also, I am looking for the correct legal name
of the company, if any, that will provide a guaranty.

I am also trying to find out who within your company handles the
contract documentation for the power contracts.  I would like to get
their name, phone number, fax number and email address.  Is this
something you could help me with?

Thanks for your help.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

GO AHEAD AND LAUGH A LITTLE.  ITS FREE 
This is a good one! 
> THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS  
> By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 
>  
> I hate this time of year.  Not for its crass  commercialism and forced 
> frivolity, but because  it's the season when the food police come  out 
>  with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the  
> holidays without gaining 10 pounds.  You can't pick  up a magazine 
> without finding a list of holiday  eating do's and don'ts.  Eliminate 
> second  helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, they  
> say.  Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say.   Good grief.  Is your 
> favorite childhood memory  of Christmas a carrot stick?  I didn't think 
>  so.  Isn't mine, either.  A carrot was something you left for  Rudolph. 
> I have my own list of tips for holiday  eating.  I assure you, if you

> New Year's?  Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway.  
> 
> 1. About those carrot  sticks.  Avoid them.  Anyone who puts carrots on

> 
> 2.  Drink as much eggnog as you can.  And quickly.  Like fine

> It's a treat.  Enjoy it.  Have  one for me.  Have two.  It's later than 
>  you think.  It's Christmas! 
> 
> 3. If something comes with gravy, use it.  That's the whole  point of 
> gravy.  Pour it on.  Make a  volcano out of your mashed potatoes.  Fill 
> it  with gravy.  Eat the volcano.  Repeat. 
>  
> 4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're  made with skim milk or 
> whole milk.  If it's  skim, pass.  Why bother?  It's like buying a

> 
> 5. Do not have a snack before going to  a party in an effort to control 
> your eating.   The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
> other people's food for free.  Lots of it.  Hello?   Remember college? 
> 
> 6.  Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
> Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else  to do. 
> This is the time for long naps, which you'll  need after circling the 
> buffet table while carrying  a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
>  eggnog. 
> 
> 7. If you come  across something really good at a buffet table, like

Alisha,

I called a few of the companies that we had not heard from in awhile. Here's what I found:

Coral - They are waiting on us to get back with them on comments that they sent us early September. (Do you have their comments? If not call, Radie Wilson she said she sent them to us twice)
Unocal - Their legal is reviewing our special provisions.
Hess - I left John Crespo a message, but I would like you to follow up with him too. He is a new contact since Shari Ward left so we may have to start over.
Dynegy - Pat Cokes said that he would call Debra, but please ask her if he called. If he did not, please call him and work on the GISB with him.
Mirant - I left Stephanie Tolbert a message. No response yet.
Pan Canadian - I left Rick Tucker a message. No response yet.

I will let you know if I hear back on those that I have left messages. I appreciate your following up on the others.

I am not really concerned about completing GISBs with the counterparties below. I do not know who initiated contact with them. If we get them, great. If we don't, no 
real loss.

AES New Energy
Cypress Natural Gas
Texaco

I appreciate your help. Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

Regarding the above refenced GISB amendment which I brought up to you this morning (i.e. the amendment with insufficient legal language), here is the contact information:

Shary Walsh Mckay, Contract Manager
E-mail: sharyn.walsh-mcakay@PSEG.com
Phone: (973) 430-6825
Fax #: (973) 623-0328


I also heard from Kim Gentle of Avista Energy, Inc. this morning.  They are the ones who sent back the amendment with the signature line missing.  She said she had talked with you and you were going to mail her an executed amendment for her to sign but she has not yet received it.  She said the signature line seems to get cut off when the amendment is sent to her electronically.   Her phone # is (509) 495-4055 and e-mail address is kgentle@avistaenergy.com.

Hi,
 
Got your message today, thanks.  I spent my gift certificate at Urban Retreat and now I am exhausted.  Too much beauty in one day!!  Tomorrow I have to go to MDA to my onocologist.  I am doing well except for the food issues.  I have lost 17 pounds because I still have alot of nausea.  I am sure it will pass soon and all the weight will come pouring back on!!!  Hope you are doing OK and not working yourself to death.  Take care and talk to you soon.

America's surefire plan to defeat the terrorists. 

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train 
us 
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, 
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - 
drop 
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let 
us 
do what comes naturally. 

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard 
stuff 
like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make 
even 
armed men in turbans tremble. 

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them 
and 
their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't 
left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of 
finding 
a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by 

lightning.  We have nothing to lose. 

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, 
and 
the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a 
pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of 
Afghanistan 
with no food at all! 

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware 

stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no 
problem. 

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, 
please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and 
extended 
families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal 
warfare. 

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is 
for 
how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We 

know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or 
without 
the government's help! 

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as 
we 
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. 

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!

Debra:

I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel
are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms.
Medcalf.  They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested
changes.  I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my
change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment
dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other
Resale Customers.

I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format
requirement of the Buyer?

Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move
forward. I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my
progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Stacy-
We (Bryant Frihart) have a deal where we have a buy and a sell for the same price, volumes, etc.  Basically it is a wash. However, on the buy, the cp is wanting there receivable in 2002.  The comments in the system read ENA will pay Octagon on January 2, 2002 by wire.  My question is does this have to be worded a certain way on the confirm and if so can you please provide this to me.  Below is the buy for you to view.

Thanks

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Debra,

I think this is the wrong attachment. It looks to be an amendment with Avista.

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

 I just got this from my cousin, don't know how true it is, but wanted to
 pass it on just in case.....
 
 Malls on 10/31
 
 This came from my sister Amy...she normally doesn't send forwards, so I
 felt like it was important to get the word out anyway. I think you all
 know
 that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the reactionary thing and send
 out anything that crosses my path. This one, however, is a friend of a
 friend and I've given it enough credibility in my mind that I'm writing it
 up and sending it out to all of you. 
 
 My friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. She had
 a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably upset
 and went to his home to find it completely emptied. On 9/10, she received
 a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her
 why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that. The part
 worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
 airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As
 soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since
 turned over the letter.
 
 This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came
 from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.
 I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being
 correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second
 and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information
 that I did.

Veroinca,

Below is some additional information regarding our conversation yesterday on MMS. There are 3 deals in Sitara that capture the deal that Nelson has done that begins November and runs through March (Deal #1103008, 1103884, 1103914). We are working with Gerald Nemec to establish a GISB to cover this deal. We are going to use the same form that was used by Enron North America. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me.

Judy

Nelson, your current GISB is dated 1/1/2001 and is between Enron North
America Corp. and MMS.

When we scored the 2000 financials we used Enron Corp. financial statements.
We can certainly use other Enron subsidiary's financials if you want to
provide them but, if Enron North America Upstream Company LLC is the
purchaser and the only financial statements we have are Enron Corp. we would
like the parental guarantee to be from Enron Corp.


Enclosed is a guarantee that is available on our web page. You can provide
your own if that is more convenient. At a minimum, the guarantee should
cover 60 days volume at current prices and the term should go from the first
delivery date under the contract until  60 days beyond the last delivery
date. In some cases, we have had companies increase the term and value of
the guarantee so that adjustments don't have to be made for subsequent
purchases.

I know that this is additional paperwork. We are trying to streamline things
as much as we can. But, one of the things we have to deal with is making
sure we are consistent with all our purchasers. We appreciate your continued
interest in the MMS RIK program. Let me know if you have any questions. My
phone is 303-275-7224. Sorry for the long winded message. Hope you have a
good weekend.

Stacy-
We (Bryant Frihart) have a deal where we have a buy and a sell for the same price, volumes, etc.  Basically it is a wash. However, on the buy, the cp is wanting there receivable in 2002.  The comments in the system read ENA will pay Octagon on January 2, 2002 by wire.  My question is does this have to be worded a certain way on the confirm and if so can you please provide this to me.  Below is the buy for you to view.

 
Thanks 
Richard

The person that I was talking to at Dynegy left. What was the problem with the original grty? Did they not make the initial changes that Gerald wanted?

What about the AES NewEnergy, Inc Enfolio?

 I am waiting on revisions to the Dynegy Holdings, Inc. Gty.  So if you can push on these folks it would be great.  I have sent the final draft to Nicor Energy, LLC today for their review.  The Nicor Gty is ok.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Ms. Osire,

The Amendment is not correct.  As I have told you repeatedly, Northern
States Power Company is still the contracting party, not Xcel Energy Inc.
Xcel Energy Inc. is the holding company which owns Northern States Power
Company, however the utility still contracts and operates in its own name as
an operating utility company.  We cannot execute the Amendment until it
correctly states the parties to the Agreement.

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Debra - I would prefer that you submit an original with Enron's signature
and we submit an original to you with our signature.  That would reduce the
mailing time as our contracting officer is in Herndon, Virginia.  Is that
okay by you?

 Further to our discussion regarding Article 5. Force Majeure, we will
agree to the option to terminate the Transaction after the 60 day period
provided damages if any as stated in Article 3. have been paid plus the
termination payment.

Let me have your thoughts.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Dear Friends and Family,
We wanted to let you know that baby Rebekah Ruth Moats was born by cesarean
section on 10 January at 10:00 a.m.  She was 20.4 inches long and 7 lb. 15
oz in weight.  Both Mommy and baby are doing well.  No signs of jaundice
with this child.  Ruthie and Rebekah will stay in Kediri until after
Rebekah's two-week check-up.  Jeff and Naomi and Esther will head back to
Jember as soon as we receive the birth certificate so that we can register
the baby with the American Consulate.  We thank you for your prayers.

Grateful For the Gift of Life,
Jeff For All

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :	Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Debra,  I think we were waiting on credit for this one.  I believe we answered their question that Atmos Energy Corp. would be the one executing the documents.  Can you check with Veronica?

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost

Here is the link to the GISB, however trade has been terminated on this agreement as it was assigned last year to HPL prior to the sale.  Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.

debra,

Please see the attached 1st draft of pricing language for the Unimark deal # 1062624.  I am not sure about the NX 1 language, (you may want to ask Gerald?).

 

I have a total of 4 deals with Unimark which will use  similar language (with the  5 pricing tiers), so once you approve of this one, I can use it as a templete for the other deals.

thanks so much.  lisa

Here is the GTC deal clearing report for September 2001.  I've included counterparties with greater than 100 online deals, 100 spot deals, or 30 firm deals clearing on GTCs.  I've also included a few counterparties under those thresholds because of the poor credit rating (those counterparties are highlighted).

Please let me know if you have any questions or need to change these reporting thresholds.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

I can't really take a long lunch today, but I was thinking of grabbing something downstairs in the cafeteria.  Would you be open?  We can catch up for a little while.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

 I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen=
tence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete th=
is as it does not allow for Force Majeure.

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome=
r may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed=
 Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r=
equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du=
ring selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request =
must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the=
 last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.=
  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible=
 Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix=
ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which=
 a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original =
Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to=
 the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac=
ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles=
s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit=
y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant=
ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without =
limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Dear WENH members,

Each year, WENH holds a holiday charity luncheon benefitting women or
children in the Greater Houston area.  This year's event will be held on
Friday, December 7, at 11:30 a.m. at the Houstonian.  We are excited to
announce that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will be the keynote speaker at
this year's event.  The Senator will discuss energy issues and provide an
update from Capitol Hill.  At the end of her speech, WENH will present her
with an award for her contribution to the energy industry.

This year's beneficiary is Girls Inc. of Greater Houston.  Girls Inc. is a
wonderful organization that helps girls from all walks of life become
strong, smart, and bold in order to achieve their full potential.  Proceeds
from the event will help fund such programs as Operation S.M.A.R.T., which
gives girls hands-on experience with math, science, and technological
applications.  Sixty percent of the girls that are served belong to racial
and ethnic minority groups; more than fifty percent of the girls come from
families living below the poverty level; and over half are from single
parent households, most of which are headed by women.

You will soon receive a fund-raising packet in the mail.  Please take a few
minutes and forward it to the partners in your firm, your charitable
contributions, governmental affairs, public affairs, and/or human resources
departments, or other  decision-makers as appropriate.

We will mail the event invitations in early November.  Individual ticket
prices are $60 for WENH members and $75 for guests.   We anticipate a
sell-out, so after you have received your invitation, please remit your
payment at your earliest convenience.  Due to the large number of people we
are expecting, walk-ins will not be accepted and any cancellations will be
considered donations to Girls Inc.

The Houstonian will be beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the
ballroom has recently been remodeled.  So, mark your calendars and join us
for our charity gala!  This is one event you won't want to miss!

Carol McCutcheon
Special Events Director

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Okay, all.  I am sure there is a very good deal behind this, but do any of you know where the recently received, state of West Virginia title to a used trailer belongs?  The year of the trailer is 1995, the make of the trailer is "NORS", and the serial number is N01020318TN.  The title was issued by WV on 09/26/01 to Enron North America Corp., no lienholder (well, that's a good fact!).

Please ask around your groups regarding who is interested in holding on to this title.  Unless otherwise notified, I am going to have it sent to the vault.  Please call me if you know to whom it should be directed.

Houston Astros Baseball season tickets are available sale to employees at their face value.  The seats range in price from $2,490 to $3,237 for the season, and are located in the box and club levels. 

If you're interested in being on the list of potential buyers for Enron's season tickets to the Astro's 2002 home games, please indicate your interest by 4PM, Central Time on Thursday, March 21 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined, we'll know whether a lottery process will need to take place to fairly allocate the purchase opportunities and will communicate that to respondents.

Please note that the season begins on Friday, March 29 so payment for the tickets will need to be made early next week. 

If you have any questions, please call Elizabeth Linnell at x33896 or Rachel Tobor at x31481.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________
To download the software:
1)  Visit the ClickAtHome Portal at www.clickathome.net from your ClickAtHome PC.
2)  Logon to the Portal with your personally created Portal User ID and Password, or create a new account if you have not created a user ID and password by selecting "Create a NEW Account" at the top left corner.  The Portal User IDs and Passwords are created by you.  The Enron Help Desk is not able to assist with Portal support, but if you need any assistance, please send an email to "clickathome@enron.com".
3) Once you have logged on, select "Tools" from the top menu bar.
4) Under the "Secure Download" heading, click on "BlackICE" or "Norton" and log on to the download page using your SAP ID and Date of Birth.
5) Follow the directions provided on screen.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Debra,

Please, disregard the e-mail I just sent you on Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The GISB we need to amend is with Phillips Petroleum Company.  The counterparty called back and drew to my attention that we incorrectly booked our deals under Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The deals should have been booked under Phillips Petroleum Company and I have communicated same to the Trader.  Details for Phillips Petroleum Company are as follows:

Contact:  Janice White
Contract #: 96029335
E-mail: jgwhite@ppco.com
Phone: (713) 669-7351
Fax:(713) 669-7358

If you notice all the contact information stays the same except for the contract number.

Thanks,


Ann

>From Prevention's stress columnist, Pam Peeke, MD

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train us for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks,
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna, drop us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us do what comes naturally.

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.  We have nothing to lose.

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan
with no food at all!

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no
problem.

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal warfare.

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is
for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.
We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or
without the government's help!

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as we
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

	The Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating UNIX home directories and applications to new hardware on October 13 and 14, 2001.  The migration will begin on Saturday the 13th at 7:00 PM and will be completed by 1:00 AM on Sunday, October 14, 2001.

	The migration requires a total system outage, so home directories and applications will not be available during the above time period.  Please log off before you leave for the weekend.
	Development teams members will test all migrated applications on Sunday, October 14, 2001.

Debra,
Attached is a word document showing the schedule of  high school events through the end of the year.  We will be working on the  spring schedule soon.
 
If your still interested in helping out (I hope you  haven't changed your mind after attending a few meetings) you'll need  to have the "At Risk" training.  This training is mandatory for any  adult wishing to work with our youth groups.  I'll check in the office and  see if you can still do this through video or if you have to attend a scheduled  class.
 
I hope that you will be as blessed by working with  the high school kids as I am.  
 
Nancy

Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation. 



Thanks
Rudwell

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Sure.  I guess you didn't get my email about getting a table.  Well, I now have a phone, and hopefully you'll have one soon.  Let's definitely shoot for Thursday.  I may take Friday off if I get everything done this week.

Sorry too!

What do you think about Stacy's news????

Hey, lady,

I just got back from eating on 2.  I grabbed a table and looked for you the entire time, but didn't see you.  Then I got your message.  Where were you?

Let's try it again soon.

Debra:

Thank you for sending the WMBE letter for payment
arrangements.  But I forgot to ask you about a follow on
a conversation that we had a few weeks ago about any
language in our Enfolio Agreement that would speak to the
unlikely event that should NDR  go out of business that
the enduser would still receive the natural gas that they
contracted with us for.  This questions is very important
at this time as we are negotiating a term deal with a
major utility in the mid-west. Your timely suggestion or
direction would be greatly appreciated.  You can call me
at 301-516-1636 or by reply e-mail.

Thank you,
Rickey Hart

Debra -

Attached is a worksheet for a Master Firm Purchase/Sale with TXU Gas Company.  Please prepare a draft at your earliest convenience, as we need to send out to the counterparty immediately to execute a term deal.  I will forward the email address of the contact at TXU Gas as soon as possible.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,

JRW
