YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. My company matches a certain percent of my pay, depending on
how much
I contribute to my 401(k) plan. The matching money goes only
into the company employee stock-purchase program, but my own
contributions can go into various mutual funds. Shouldn't I at
least contribute enough to this 401(k) to get the maximum amount
that the company will match?

A. You've answered your own question correctly. In most cases,
it's definitely smart to take advantage of as much company
matching as possible. Let's say that for every $1 you sock away
in your 401(k), your employer chips in 50 cents. That's an
immediate 50 percent return! It would be extremely difficult to
beat that with any investment method.

The only time it might not be so great is if the matching money
isn't going into something you're comfortable with. If it's
going into stock in the company and you're very uncomfortable
about the company's future, then perhaps you're getting a 50
percent return that will soon become a 0 percent return. That's
an extreme example, though. And even in that case, the money
that YOU socked away can be in a safer place, growing. For a
60-second guide to 401(k)s, check out this article.


Q. If I own shares of a company and the company is bought out or
merges with another company, what happens to my shares?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=413428

A. Several things could happen. If the firm is bought out for
cash, you might receive a check for your shares. If it's bought
with stock or there's a merger involving a stock swap, your
shares might be replaced with shares of another company. The
number of shares you get will be prescribed by an announced
formula. Some deals involve both stock and cash. When a deal
you're interested in is announced, track down its press releases
for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

DIVIDEND YIELDS
A company's "dividend yield" is a valuable concept to
understand, but many people scratch their heads when confronted
with it. So let us explain. It simply expresses the relationship
of two numbers: a stock's price and the amount of its annual dividend.

As an example, look at Ford Motor Co. At the time of this
writing, it was trading around $51 per share, and paying out $2
per year (in quarterly installments) as a dividend. Take $2 and
divide it by $51 and you'll get 0.039. Multiply that by 100 and
you've got a dividend yield of 3.9%. This means that if you pay
$51 for a share of Ford, you'll earn 3.9% per year on your
investment, just from dividends alone.

Companies rarely decrease or eliminate their dividends, as that
would make investors unhappy. But, dividends of solid companies
do tend to rise over time, delivering more value to
shareholders. Every now and then, a company will announce an
increase. If, in 20 years, Ford's dividend is $8, that would
represent a 15.7% dividend yield on those shares you bought for
$51. You'd be earning a 15.7% return each year, just from
dividends. There would probably be some stock price appreciation
on top of that, as well.

Note that, for months or years at a time, a dividend will hold
steady. But, the yield can fluctuate daily. That's because a
stock's price fluctuates. As a stock price rises, the dividend
yield falls, and vice versa. If Ford shares, for example,
suddenly doubled in price to $102, the yield would be halved, to
2% ($2 divided by $102 is 0.02). If Ford stock fell to $30 per
share, its yield for those buying it at $30 would be 6.7%.

You can find some hefty dividend yields among companies whose
stock prices have tumbled. A year or two ago, for example, R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings paid about $3.00 per share in annual
dividends. With its stock trading around $30 per share, that was
a whopping 10% dividend yield! Be careful, though. If you're
attracted to an unusually high dividend yield, you should
probably study the company extra carefully to make sure it's not
in so much trouble that a dividend cut is around the corner.

Lastly, know that not all companies pay dividends. Younger or
quickly growing companies in particular, such as Microsoft or
Amgen, prefer to plow extra cash back into operations.

PEPSI FINALLY WINS QUAKER
PepsiCo will wed Quaker for $13.4 billion in stock.

By Tom Jacobs

Ending weeks of maneuvering and speculation, PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP)
has agreed to buy Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) for $13.4 billion in
stock. Pepsi matched its deal of one month ago of 2.3 shares per
Quaker share, valuing Quaker at $97.46 per share, based on
Pepsi's Friday close at $42.38. Quaker ended Friday at $88.63.

The deal follows weeks of machinations that began with a
rejected Pepsi bid for Quaker, followed by interest from
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) --
reportedly at a price more than $14 billion. With the departure
of Coke and Groupe Danone from negotiations, attention returned
to Pepsi,whose original lower offer now looked darn good to
almost-left-at-the-altar Quaker.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225166
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=225167

The pact creates a food and beverage powerhouse with $25 billion
in revenues and an expected $80 billion market cap. The deal
gives Pepsi three key advantages: 1) Pepsi swigs Quaker Oats'
Gatorade sports drink, which is tops in its market and carries a
huge distribution and warehouse system that Pepsi hopes will
increase efficiency and reach for its Tropicana brand; 2)
Quaker's fruit, oatmeal, and granola bar and other snack
products will spice Pepsi's Frito-Lay and other snack foods; 3)
highly profitable Quaker brands such as Quaker Oatmeal, Life and
Cap'n Crunch Cereals, Rice-A-Roni ("the San Francisco treat!"),
and Aunt Jemima syrup provide hefty free cash flow.

Pepsi's CEO and Chairman Robert Enrico had planned to retire,
and will now speed up his move. Current President Steve
Reinemund will become CEO, and Enrico will remain on the board
as vice chairman. Quaker's CEO Robert Morrison, credited with
Quaker's turnaround, committed to stay on for 18 months and will
join Enrico on the board as a vice chairman. Indra Nooyi,
Pepsi's CFO, becomes president, increasing the ranks of
big-company top-level women executives.

The fianc,s agreed to two price conditions: If Pepsi stock drops
under $40 for 10 days in the month before closing, valuing
Quaker at $92 a share, Quaker may walk unless Pepsi commits to
$92 a share. On the flip side, Pepsi pays no more than $105 a
share, even if its stock climbs over $45.65 a share. Pepsi will
issue 315 million shares to pay for the purchase, which the
parties expect to be completed in the first half of 2001 --
depending on antitrust scrutiny.

NEWS TO GO

Bloomberg reports the network storage giant EMC (NYSE: EMC) will
introduce a product, code-named Chameleon, to compete against
Network Appliance (Nasdaq: NTAP) in the small to medium-size
business market for network attached storage (NAS). EMC already
competes in the market for large corporation NAS, and holds 30%
of the overall NAS market compared to Network Appliance's 40%,
according to information technology market researcher IDC. IDC
estimates that the NAS market will reach $7 billion by 2003. EMC
closed Friday at $78.25, off a 52-week high of $103.94, while
Network Appliance finished at $53.94, from a 52-week top of
$152.75.

Barron's reported in its December 4 edition that eBay (Nasdaq:
EBAY) was in talks to buy uBid, a unit of CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI).
Reuters reported that an eBay source denied the story, though
eBay declined official comment. According to Barron's, UBid
plans to pop the champagne this week on a new
consumer-to-consumer auction site, Auction Exchange, to compete
with eBay. UBid has 1.5 million registered users, and its
current online auction site sells mostly refurbished and
closed-out consumer electronics.

Bad news keeps copying at Xerox (NYSE: XRX). After Moody
downgraded Xerox debt to junk-bond status on Friday, the company
announced it would lay off 200 production workers -- the first
time in more than a year that the company has fired union
workers. The laid-off employees must work until December 22 but
will receive pay and benefits through January 26. This action
follows November's decision to pink-slip 350 white-collar U.S.
workers, and both are separate from last March's decision to lay
off 5,200 workers by April 2001. Xerox shares closed Friday at
$6.25, down 56.3 cents, or 8%.

Swiss drug giant Novartis (NYSE: NVS) announced positive Phase
II results from its developmental leukemia drug, Glivec.
Leukemia involves uncontrolled proliferation of white blood
cells. Glivec selectively targets a key protein involved in
leukemia, and Novartis hopes the drug will be used instead of
painful bone marrow transplants or more toxic alpha interferon
treatment. Significant response rates varied according to the
disease stage, and ranged from 33% to 78%, with 30% showing
normal blood counts. Glivec is still several years from the
pharmacy shelves because it faces larger Phase III studies and
application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
marketing approval.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm interested in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts),
but I don't understand what "FFO" refers to. Can you explain?

-- A. REITs look and act much like ordinary stocks, but peek
under their hoods and you'll see a different kind of company.
REITs typically own many properties, such as offices, hotels or
apartments. With most companies, net income is a useful number
to evaluate, reflecting the profits left over from sales after
all expenses have been subtracted. With REITs, though, net
income isn't as meaningful.

According to accounting rules, the value of REIT properties is
decreased over time, with depreciation charged against net
income, reducing it. In reality, however, these properties are
probably not falling in value and may even be appreciating. So a
REIT's net income tends to understate its health. This is why,
with REITs, you should look at the "funds from operation," or
FFO, instead. They ignore the effect of depreciation and other
non-cash charges to help you see a REIT's true performance.

-- Q. I often see S&P futures referred to on CNBC. Can you
explain what futures are and why they're important?

-- A. Futures are typically for commodities like lumber,
soybeans and orange juice. They represent contracts between two
parties to buy or sell a certain amount for a specified price at
a set future date. (Fail to pay attention, and you risk having
to take delivery of truckloads of pork bellies!)

With S&P 500 futures, each day the party who bet wrong is
obligated to pony up cash based on the price of the S&P 500.
Futures are bought by some investors to protect themselves
against unfavorable price swings or by speculators betting on
where the market is going. They can be very risky.

Un-Foolish short-term investors pay a lot of attention to S&P
futures, as they can indicate the market's likely moves before
trading begins for the day. We don't fret about futures, though,
remembering that for most of this century, the S&P 500 has
advanced about 11 percent per year, on average.

INVESTING BASICS - DEBATING DEBT

Many investors think that debt on a company's balance sheet is a
red flag. In truth, though, debt can be both bad and good.

First, the bad. If a company is saddled with a lot of debt, it's
locked into interest payments that it must make. If it doesn't
have the cash to cover these at any point, it's in deep doodoo.
Many individuals can probably relate to this, having experienced
the dark side of debt when racking up charges on credit cards.

Now, the good. Consider that most people would never be able to
buy their homes without debt. Without car and school loans, many
of us would probably be driving used cars and taking
correspondence courses we found on matchbook covers.

Debt can be a boon for businesses, too. Many great companies,
such as Federal Express and the Walt Disney Co., came to life
because of early loans to their founders. Established companies
can make good use of debt, as well, borrowing to expand
operations and grow business. Interest payments also decrease a
company's taxable income, as they're deductible. Investors
willing to consider companies with debt need to evaluate whether
the debt taken on is manageable and whether the capital raised
and invested is earning more than it costs.

Perhaps you're worried about the debt load of
Fingernail-on-Blackboard Car Alarm Co. (ticker: AIEEE). Glance
at the notes in the annual report and you may find that the
effective interest rate for its debt is just 5 percent. If AIEEE
is putting the borrowed funds to work earning say, 8 percent,
then things aren't so bad.

When companies need money, they typically have two main choices:
They can issue more stock or debt. Issuing stock can dilute the
value of existing shares. Issuing debt can sometimes be more
efficient, as its after-tax cost can be much cheaper than
equity. All things being equal, though, we prefer to see little
debt on a balance sheet.

Companies that can grow without using debt or issuing extra
stock are in a more powerful position than other firms. Still,
you needn't balk at the first sight of debt. Just evaluate it
carefully.

NOKIA TO THE RESCUE
The leading mobile phone maker reports estimate-beating earnings
and an optimistic outlook for sales of its mobile handsets.

By Chris Rugaber

Finnish mobile handset manufacturer and Rule Maker Nokia (NYSE:
NOK) reported third-quarter earnings this morning, coming in
significantly higher than analysts' expectations. The company
also issued positive forecasts for next quarter and for mobile
phone sales in 2001. Nokia was scheduled to report earnings next
week, but apparently decided to do so earlier in response to the
recent volatility in technology and telecom shares.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=161169

Sales rose 50% over last year's third quarter to 7.57 billion
euros ($6.38 billion), while net income jumped 40% to 892
million euros ($752.22 million), or 0.19 per share. Pretax
profit increased 43% to 1.34 billion euros ($1.13 billion),
ahead of analysts' forecasts of 1.06 billion.

Nokia's shares had declined about 40% since the company's July
warning that third-quarter profit would be lower than the second
quarter's, due to product delays. Today's report, and the
company's optimistic outlook, reversed that trend, with shares
up 18% in European trading.

Mobile phone sales, which account for almost three-quarters of
the company's revenues, increased 59%, while operating profits
for the division were up 42% to 1.07 billion euros ($900
million). Operating margin decreased to 19.6%, from 21.9%,
though the company remains far ahead of No. 2 mobile phone maker
Motorola (NYSE: MOT), which recently posted a 6% operating
margin for its cell phone division.

Nokia introduced seven new handset models in the third quarter,
and the company believes it increased its handset market share,
which stood at 27.5% at the end of the second quarter. Motorola
controlled 15.6% and Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY), which reports
earnings tomorrow, held 10.3%.

While other mobile phone companies, such as Motorola and
Matsushita, have reduced their projections for industrywide
handset sales, Nokia maintained a positive outlook. "Our view of
the market development fundamentals remains unchanged, with more
than 400 million mobile phones estimated to be sold in 2000,"
said CEO Jorma Olilla in a prepared statement. "For 2001 we
expect the mobile phone market to be in the region of 550
million units." Olilla also stated that as a result of these
figures, the company expects there will be 1 billion mobile
phone users by 2002.

Sales in the company's wireless infrastructure unit were also
strong, with revenues up 34% to 1.92 billion euros and operating
margins improving to 18.1% from 17.3%. Overall, the company
expects "record-breaking" earnings per share (EPS) for the
fourth quarter, and 25-35% sales growth in 2001.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

TECH HEAVIES REPORT EARNINGS
By The Motley Fool Staff
A number of top companies reported earnings last night after the
bell. Check out our after-hours coverage for news on Microsoft
(Nasdaq: MSFT), Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM), America Online (NYSE:
AOL), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), and several other companies, many
that don't begin with A.

NEWS TO GO

Network switch-maker Extreme Networks (Nasdaq: EXTR) announced
first-quarter fiscal 2001 earnings last night, clocking in with
net income (excluding amortization costs) of $9 million, or
$0.08 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.06 share,
and double the year-ago figure of $4 million, or $0.04 per
share. Sales were up 29% sequentially to $119.3 million, 153%
higher than last year's third-quarter revenue of $47.2 million.
Shares of the company fell initially in after-hours trading, but
rebounded after the company increased its earnings forecasts for
fiscal 2001 and 2002.

Communications chip designer Broadcom (Nasdaq: BRCM) joined the
earnings parade after yesterday's market close. Sales for the
company's third quarter more than doubled, to $319.6 million,
while earnings (excluding acquisition and other costs) jumped to
$78.7 million, or $0.30 per share, from last year's $28.7
million, or $0.12 per share. Consensus analysts' estimates were
for the company to earn $0.24 per share. Broadcom designs chips
for cable modems, digital set-top boxes, and other high-speed
networking equipment.

Wireless communications software company Phone.com (Nasdaq:
PHCM) also reported earnings last night, and the developer of
the Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP, increased revenues
62% sequentially, to $46.5 million. The company's net loss,
excluding amortization and other costs, was $10.4 million, or
$0.13 per diluted share, ahead of consensus estimates for a
$0.20 per share loss. Phone.com's new partner, Software.com
(Nasdaq: SWCM), with which it expects to merge next month, also
announced earnings. Sales reached $37.6 million, a 27%
sequential increase, and earnings before acquisition and other
costs were $7.4 million, or $0.13 per share, ahead of estimates
of $0.03 per share.

And now for some non-earnings news: According to a Bloomberg
report, telecom carrier WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOM) is planning to
create a tracking stock for its consumer long-distance business.
The company indicated during its July earnings conference call
that it was considering several options for its slow-growing
voice operation, including a tracking stock. While WorldCom did
not comment on yesterday's report, final word may come when the
company releases earnings on October 26. Like other
long-distance carriers, WorldCom is seeking to highlight the
healthy growth of its data and Internet services by separating
out the stagnant consumer long-distance unit, which grew
revenues by only 1% last quarter.

CONTINENTAL, NORTHWEST DEAL DURING TRIAL
With their federal court trial at hand, the two major air
carriers do a deal.

By Tom Jacobs

Feeling the heat of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust
trial against them, defendants Northwest Airlines (Nasdaq: NWAC)
and Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today an
agreement intended to end the dispute. The DOJ sued the airlines
in 1998 over a deal giving Northwest 54% voting control over
Continental -- preventing Continental's takeover by Delta Air
Lines (NYSE: DAL). Under the deal, Continental would buy back
Northwest's common stock. The parties will ask the federal judge
to delay the trial, which started last week, while the carriers
work out the details.

A CAREFUL DEAL
The deal has two goals: to address the DOJ's belief that the
Northwest-Continental combination would lead to higher prices
for consumers, and to retain the benefits of the two air powers'
alliance.

The pact extends the alliance through 2025 and changes the
Northwest-Continental relationship. According to the deal,
Northwest will pay $450 million for 6.69 million Continental
Class A shares, and hold on to 2.6 million Class B shares.
Continental will recapitalize, reclassifying each Class A share
into 1.32 shares of Class B common stock. Continental will issue
Northwest a special series of preferred stock, which will give
Northwest blocking rights over certain Continental business
combinations and change of control between Continental and a
third party. Continental can redeem its preferred stock under
certain conditions, such as a change of control at Northwest.

A DELICATE BALANCE
The industry and the government are groping in the
post-deregulation era to weigh the needs of consumers against
cutthroat worldwide airline competition. For example, the DOJ is
separately reviewing United Airlines' (NYSE: UAL) $4.3 billion
purchase of US Airways Group (NYSE: U). All the airlines have
formed alliances similar to Northwest's and Continental's,
involving the now-common practice of code-sharing, which means
putting customers who buy tickets with one airline on the other
airline's flights, and offering reciprocal frequent-flyer
programs and airport lounge rights.

The trial began last week after a week's delay, during which
settlement talks continued. But the trial pressure ultimately
caused a change at Northwest, which rejected earlier this year
Continental's buyback offer. At that time the two agreed to
reduce Northwest's power over Continental's daily operations --
but it apparently didn't satisfy the DOJ.

Pending the judge's decision on the seven-day delay, Continental
and Northwest plan to execute the agreement in one week. They
expect it will take two months to close the deal, which would be
subject to settlement of the litigation with the DOJ.

Lorillard Tobacco, owned by Loews Corp. (NYSE: LTR), and Liggett
Group, owned by Miami's Vector Group (NYSE: VGR), will announce
a $8 billion settlement in federal court tobacco litigation in
Brooklyn. The move is said to include a 30-year payment
schedule, with Lorillard paying the bulk -- $7.5 billion. The
Journal reports that the parties hope to insulate themselves
from liability from the Florida state court $144.87 billion
judgment. The two tobacco companies split from their colleagues
after the Florida verdict and have been negotiating with other
plaintiffs' groups seeking a class action before U.S. Judge Jack
Weinstein of Brooklyn, famed for his handling of mass tort
litigation cases such as the Agent Orange and asbestos
class-action lawsuits.

Santa Clara, Calif. computer chip maker Transmeta reportedly
plans to hold its initial public offering this week. Transmeta
makes microprocessors said to use less power and extend battery
life in PC notebooks and Internet appliances. Expected investor
demand led Transmeta last Friday to raise its projected IPO
share price range to $16-$18 from $11-$13. Apparently, interest
remains high despite last week's big news that IBM (NYSE: IBM)
canceled plans to use a Transmeta chip in a new laptop computer.

Computer networking product maker 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) agreed to
settle shareholder lawsuits related to its 1997 $8.5 billion
merger with U.S. Robotics. The settlement will be for $259
million. Shareholders alleged that 3Com inflated its stock price
by giving rosy financial projections and delaying -- or hiding
-- the news of a huge backlog of unsold U.S. Robotics modems,
while executives of both companies sold 4 million shares with
3Com stock at its peak. Those who bought 3Com stock between
April 23 and November 5, 1997, are eligible to share in the settlement.

After last week's decision by media giant Bertelsmann AG to ally
with Napster and finance its move to a royalty-paying music
service, two top executives of Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment
unit quit. Chairman Michael Dornemann and President Strauss
Zelnick said they would depart, reportedly unhappy with new
directions at Bertelsmann and BMG's reduced role in television
and the Internet. Under Zelnick, BMG's album market share
increased 50%, from 13% to 20%, and the company grew to own more
than 200 record labels in 54 countries. Zelnick exits with a
sweet severance package estimated at between $20 million and $50
million.

ADC'S SOLID Q4
Broadband equipment company ADC reported strong growth in Q4.

By LouAnn Lofton

Broadband networking equipment maker ADC (Nasdaq: ADCT) reported
fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the
market's close. Strong broadband connectivity sales led to net
income growth (excluding charges) of 94%, beating estimates.

ADC's sales for the fourth quarter were $1.03 billion, ahead of
last year's $634 million by 63%. Pro forma operating income
increased 121% to $206 million, from $93 million. Pro forma net
income for the quarter was $138 million versus the year-ago $71
million. On a per-share basis, ADC earned $0.18. Analysts as
polled by First Call/Thompson Financial expected $0.17 a share.

ADC's broadband connectivity sales grew 102% compared to last
year. The company's international sales increased 63% to $227
million. North America and Europe continue to be ADC's largest
sales regions.

Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, ADC expects full-year
earnings per share to be between $0.68 and $0.70, which is
in-line with current estimates. The company sees its sales for
the year coming in between $4.15 billion and $4.30 billion. ADC
does expect first-quarter earnings to come in shy of current
estimates by a penny. The company pointed to seasonal trends as
the reason for this.

ADC's chairman and CEO, William J. Cadogan, said of the results,
"We were firing on all cylinders as each of our three major
business groups and international hit all-time high sales in the
quarter. Our outstanding employees were key contributors in ADC
surpassing the significant milestone of one billion dollars in
sales for the first time in a quarter." News to Go

NEWS TO GO

Argentinians won't be getting any more Wendy's (NYSE: WEN) Spicy
Chicken Sandwiches starting soon. The fast-food company said
yesterday that it is immediately closing all 18 of its
restaurants in Argentina. They've been unprofitable for more
than a year. The company will take a onetime charge in the
fourth quarter of between $17 million and $22 million, or
$0.08-0.11 a share. CEO Jack Schuessler said, "The economic and
competitive conditions we faced in Argentina were just too
difficult to overcome, despite the efforts of our management
team and a dedicated crew at the stores."

Internet consulting company iXL (Nasdaq: IIXL) said on Tuesday
that it will lay off 850 employees and close seven offices. iXL
cut 350 jobs back in September. The latest round of job cuts
represent about 35% of iXL's staff. iXL will take a charge in
the fourth quarter for the restructuring, and expects to be
profitable by early 2001. The company has about 300 clients, and
says it plans to start focusing heavily on its top 75 clients.
Bill Getch, an iXL spokesman, said, "Our larger clients, they
want deeper engagements.... But they're taking much more time to
select and contract a lot of that work. So the sales cycle has
extended. If you've built a large infrastructure and the sales
cycle has lengthened... then you either increase the pipeline
fast enough to sustain that infrastructure or you reduce that
infrastructure."

Pork processor Smithfield Foods (NYSE: SFD) reported
second-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income
doubled to $44.6 million, or $0.81 a share, from last year's
$22.2 million, or $0.48 a share. Smithfield, therefore, beat the
consensus estimate of $0.77 a share. The company's results were
driven by live hog prices that were 20% higher in the second
quarter than they were in the previous second quarter. Sales
increased to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in the year-ago
period.

BFGoodrich (NYSE: GR) is selling its performance materials
division to an investor group for $1.4 billion, the company said
today. This completes BFGoodrich's move from a tire and chemical
company to an industrial products and aerospace company.
BFGoodrich will get $1.2 billion in cash and $200 million in
debt securities for the business. Possible uses for the proceeds
from the sale are debt repayment, acquisitions, and share
repurchases, according to the company.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ALCATEL, LUCENT CALL IT OFF
In a short joint statement that nevertheless said it all,
Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) and Lucent (NYSE: LU) said last night that
ongoing merger talks between the companies were terminated.

>>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=417140

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Computer networking equipment maker Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:
SUNW) lowered fiscal fourth-quarter (ending June 30) financial
forecasts, saying it expects to earn $0.02 to $0.04 per share,
missing First Call's $0.06 consensus estimate, as revenues come
in between $3.8 billion and $4 billion.

A U.S. district judge yesterday approved Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO)
proposed $192.5 million settlement for a race discrimination
lawsuit filed by 2,200 black employees. Coca-Cola had denied the
charges in the lawsuit, which included discrimination in
promotion and compensation. The settlement, according to
Reuters, is the largest ever for a race discrimination case.

Diversified manufacturing company Tyco International (NYSE: TYC)
agreed to buy medical products company C.R. Bard (NYSE: BCR) in
a $3.2 billion stock swap expected to value the company at $60
per share, or about a 30% premium to last night's close. C.R.
Bard's revenue in 2000 was $1.1 billion and makes equipment used
in vascular, urological, and oncological diagnosis, among other products.

Consumer electronics retailer Radio Shack (NYSE: RSH) announced
that slower-than-expected Q2 sales will result in EPS from $0.25
to $0.27, missing Wall Street's $0.34 consensus projection and
last year's $0.38. Same-store sales look to come in flat
year-over-year.

Internet career search giant TMP Worldwide (Nasdaq: TMPW), which
operates the Monster.com site, said it bought the FlipDog.com
job site from WhizBang! Labs on May 25. Terms of the deal were
not disclosed.

Athletic footwear company K-Swiss (Nasdaq: KSWS) formed a joint
venture with Rugged Shark to develop and market a line of
National Geographic-inspired outdoor and casual footwear.
K-Swiss expects it'll cost $1 million to get the line up and
ready for a fall 2002 launch. K-Swiss will own 75% of the
venture.

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. What's a "run rate"?

A. Imagine that you're studying the financial statements of
Digital Diapers Inc. (ticker: EPOOP) It's growing very rapidly
from quarter to quarter. Perhaps, for some calculation, you need
to estimate its current annual rate of sales. You could add up
the last four quarters' worth, but that would clearly understate
sales, as each quarter's numbers have been rising.

Enter the run rate. Take the most recent quarter's sales of $30
million (up from $25 million the quarter before and $21 million
before that). Multiply that by four and you'll have the
company's current run rate for sales: $120 million. This is not
a forecast or a measure of past sales -- it's a reflection of
the current level of annual sales.

Q. When you decide to sell a stock at a price listed in the
newspaper on a particular day, do you get that particular
amount, or the price listed when the shares are actually sold?

A. First, know that the stock prices listed in newspapers and
online simply reflect the price at which the stock last traded.
The next trade could occur at a higher or lower price, depending
on supply and demand.

You're not out of luck, though. You have a choice when placing
orders with your broker. You can sell "at the market," which
means whatever the current price happens to be, or you can place
a "limit order," specifying a minimum price that you require.
Selling at the market means your shares will probably be sold
quickly. With a limit order, though, you risk not getting any
takers at your price. When we're not worried about the price
jumping, we generally prefer trading at the market.

And speaking of brokers, make sure you're not overpaying for
trades by visiting our online discount broker center. You can
compare fees and services, plus get our guidance on finding the
right broker for you.

THIS WEEK'S LESSON

WHEN TO PANIC
The stock market has been down in recent months. (For some
perspective, read our recent article on keeping your head during
downturns.) Many investors are anxious, wondering whether they
should follow the crowd and bail out on some of their
investments. But, market drops are often the worst time to sell.
Here are some pointers on the fine art of panicking.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405187

People tend to panic:
- When the market tanks.
- When a stock they own tanks.
- When people around them are panicking.

None of these are particularly good reasons for panicking.

Here's when you might have cause for concern, though:

- When you don't know why you own the stocks you own. If you
  have no clue why you ever bought shares of Bedmobile Inc.
  (ticker: VROOM), you'll have a lot of trouble determining when
  it's the right time to sell. Did VROOM's shares just take a
  nosedive? It might be due to some fleeting market
  misunderstanding, in which case you should hang on. Or it might
  be due to some serious trouble at the firm. An informed investor
  should have a good handle on her investments.

- When you don't understand the long-term upward trend of the
  market. From decade to decade, stocks in great companies and the
  market as a whole both tend to rise in value. To keep your blood
  pressure down during market slumps, remind yourself of this.

- When you have a short time horizon. If your moolah is invested
  in stocks for just a few months, then go ahead and begin
  hyperventilating right now. Anything can happen in the short
  term. Even stock in wonderful companies can temporarily
  freefall. Any money you expect to need within the next five (if
  not ten or more) years should be out of stocks and perhaps in
  CDs or money market funds.

- When you haven't learned that it's the percentage of the
  market drop that counts, not the points. A 100-point drop was a
  big deal when the Dow was at 1,000. But when it's at 10,000, 100
  points is just 1 percent.

Well-informed Fools should rarely panic. Expect occasional
market slumps and surges. Read up on investing by checking out
our 13 Steps. The more you learn, the less you'll panic.

SMITHKLINE TO BUY BLOCK DRUG
The big British drug maker bolsters its consumer business.

By Tom Jacobs

British-based drug producer SmithKline Beecham (NYSE: SBH)
announced today that it would swallow New Jersey's oral products
maker Block Drug (Nasdaq: BLOCA) for $1.24 billion. SmithKline
will pay $53 a share for Block, which closed Friday at $50.63,
up 0.75%. SmithKline ended the week at $67.44, a mere 5% under
its 52-week high.

SmithKline is expanding its consumer business while competitors
such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) are shedding theirs to
focus on drugs. SmithKline already earns one-third of its
revenues from consumer products, which include Aquafresh
toothpaste, and now adds Block's Sensodyne toothpaste and
Polident denture cleaner brands. Commentators speculate that
SmithKline is keeping a consumer division to better deliver
non-prescription versions of its own drugs that have lost patent
protection, or that the Block buyout better positions SmithKline
to spin off its consumer division.

At the same time, the British drug powerhouse is pushing into
genomics: It has joined a new public-private consortium to fund
efforts to decode mouse DNA within the next six months. The $53
million Mouse Sequencing Consortium includes SmithKline,
Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX), the Merck Genome Research Institute,
the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the British-based
Wellcome Trust. Like its sibling the SNP Consortium, the Mouse
confab hopes to speed genomic data into the public domain.
Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and other companies are competing to
sequence the mouse genome and SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphisms) to sell in proprietary databases.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=147835

Surrounding these events is the pending merger of SmithKline
with larger drug maker Glaxo Wellcome (NYSE: GLX). The two await
regulatory approval to create the world's second-largest
pharmaceutical firm with a $180 billion market cap. Perhaps
because of their experience -- the Federal Trade Commission has
delayed the merger twice and now won't rule until the end of the
year -- SmithKline hasn't announced a target date to close the
Block deal.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Reuters reports that General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Fiat are
joining forces for talks to purchase some or all of ailing South
Korean car maker Daewoo. Daewoo Motor is one of 12 units of
Daewoo Group, which creditors rescued in August and seek to
shore up. Ford beat out GM in June for exclusive talks with
Daewoo, but Ford ended negotiations in September. GM and Daewoo
Motors have been around the block before -- several times. Their
15-year alliance ended in 1992.

City delivery speedsters Kozmo.com and Urbanfetch.com are
talking a Kozmo buyout again, according to The New York Times.
Kozmo has not been the most ardent suitor: It sued Urbanfetch
before it opened last year and settled out of court. The parties
have bailed from previous talks at the last minute. The Times'
sources state that the new company would hope to go public in
the next year -- if the Internet IPO market turns up.

Facing tomorrow's announcement of latest quarter earnings,
biotech drug maker Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) licensed five new drug
targets from genomics drug discovery company CuraGen (Nasdaq:
CRGN). Biogen has been criticized for the weakness of its drug
development pipeline, and the CuraGen deal gives Biogen a jump
start at the early stages of the pipeline -- five targets
against which to test possible drug candidates. Biogen also
announced a management realignment Friday.

A new gene bank, the First Genetic Trust, will open to allay
people's reluctance to share their genetic data with
researchers. Arthur Holden, chair of the SNP Consortium and
Mouse Consortium (see lead story above), will form the bank with
David Wang, former head of genomics and bioinformatics at
Motorola (NYSE: MOT), and Andrea Califano, former computational
biology director at IBM (NYSE: IBM). The bank would perform two
main functions designed to keep individual information private,
assuage fears that information could be used to deny employment
or insurance, and increase efficiency. The bank would provide
analysis results to researchers, but not the individual genetic
data, and patients could authorize the bank to give their
doctors access to a patient's DNA account for prescription
purposes instead of having to test patients each time.

COKE LOSES ITS FIZZ FOR QUAKER
Coke's board says "no thanks" to the Quaker Oats deal. Who's
next in line?

By LouAnn Lofton

First it was PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). Then it was Coca-Cola (NYSE:
KO). Now it looks like it's the French food company Groupe
Danone (NYSE: DA). What am I talking about? The latest bidder
for cereal company and Gatorade-owner Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT),
of course.

Talks between Coke and Quaker are over. Coke's board of
directors met yesterday to discuss the potential $15.75 billion
stock acquisition of Quaker. Coca-Cola wanted Quaker for the
same reason that Pepsi did -- the Gatorade sports drink.
Gatorade controls about 80% of the sports drink market, with
Coke's Powerade coming in second. Coke would have been saddled,
though, with those parts of Quaker's business that make up the
majority of its revenues and are growing the slowest -- its
cereal and oatmeal operations.

It's likely that several factors led to the decision by Coke's
board not to proceed with the Quaker acquisition. First, with
value guru Warren Buffett as a director, you better believe that
the price Coke was going to pay for Quaker was a very important
consideration. Coke's shares had been driven down 10% since the
potential deal was announced Monday, as many thought Coke would
be paying too much for Quaker.

Another factor that likely caused the board to reject the
acquisition was the potential for antitrust hang-ups with the
deal, given that Coke's sports drink Powerade controls the
largest part of the market after Gatorade. A third contributing
factor was probably one of focus. Coke refocused itself on its
core beverages business in the late 1980s, and buying Quaker --
with its Cap'n Crunch and Rice-A-Roni, among other brands --
would have moved it beyond the beverage business once again. The
company doesn't appear to want to take that route.

So, Pepsi's out, Coke's out, and already, another company has
announced that it's pulling a chair up to the bidding table.
Danone issued a statement confirming that it is considering a
bid for Quaker. The bottled water, dairy products, and biscuits
company wants to develop its business to become "a world leader
in focused, growth oriented, healthy nutrition and beverage
business." Perhaps Quaker can help it get there.

NEWS TO GO

NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corporation (NYSE: NTT), is rumored to be interested in buying a
20% stake in AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE). The investment would be
about $9 billion. A deal like this would give DoCoMo a presence
in the strong U.S. wireless communications market. Currently,
AT&T Wireless is a tracking stock of AT&T (NYSE: T). Once AT&T
splits into four separate businesses, AT&T Wireless will become
an independent company.

Software company Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) announced fourth-quarter
and fiscal year-end earnings yesterday. Sales in the fourth
quarter fell 21% to $273 million from last year's $344.5
million. A decline in sales of the company's packaged software
to small businesses impacted results. On a diluted per share
basis, Novell broke even in the fourth quarter, matching
analysts' expectations. It earned $0.17 a share in the fourth
quarter last year. For the fiscal year, net income dropped to
$49 million, or $0.15 a diluted share, compared to $191 million,
or $0.55 per share the year before.

CacheFlow (Nasdaq: CFLO) reported second-quarter results
yesterday. The company, which makes technology that improves the
flow of content over the Internet, lost $0.09 a share on a pro
forma basis. Analysts had expected a loss of $0.11 a share.
CacheFlow's revenues grew to $32.55 million from last year's
$22.45 million. This sales increase of 45% was below the 55%
increase expected by some analysts, and shares traded down
after-hours despite the company's smaller-than-expected loss.

The president of fashion designer and retailer Liz Claiborne
(NYSE: LIZ) resigned. Denise V. Seegal, whose last day is
December 8, has been president of Liz Claiborne since 1996. Liz
Claiborne's Chairman and CEO Paul Charron said that there are no
plans to replace her, and that he'll be taking over her duties.
Charron said, "We had different approaches. I wanted to get
closer to the managers running the business units."

WORLDCOM TO SPLIT INTO TWO
Telecom company WorldCom is going to create a tracking stock for
its MCI division.

By LouAnn Lofton

In an effort to boost its sagging stock price, and unlock
greater opportunities for the parts of its business that are
growing the quickest, telecommunications company WorldCom
(Nasdaq: WCOM) announced restructuring plans this morning. The
company, which has seen its stock tumble from a 52-week high in
November 1999 of $61.33 to its current price of around $23, will
create a tracking stock for its MCI business. The ticker for the
new stock will be MCIT.

WorldCom shareholders will receive one share of MCI for every 25
shares of WorldCom they own. The distribution of MCI stock is
expected to happen by the end of the first half of 2001.

Tracked under the new MCIT ticker will be WorldCom's
slowest-growing divisions. The bulk of the operations that will
be reflected with the tracking stock are WorldCom's
long-distance and dial-up Internet services for consumers and
small businesses. These parts of WorldCom's business generate
about $16 billion in annual revenues.

The split leaves WorldCom with the best-performing and
highest-growth businesses. That includes its Internet and data
businesses, its international business, and its wireless
business. These divisions of WorldCom contribute annual revenues
of around $23 billion, with $16 billion coming from the
company's data, Internet, and international operations.

WorldCom also issued earnings guidance this morning. The company
said it sees fourth-quarter earnings per share coming in between
$0.34 and $0.37. Analysts as polled by First Call/Thompson
Financial were looking for $0.49 a share. The company pointed to
"intense pricing pressures, unfavorable foreign exchange rates
and the shift of consumer voice to wireless technologies" as the
reasons for the shortfall. It also lowered expectations for its
next fiscal year.

WorldCom's decision to split its businesses comes not long after
a similar move from competitor AT&T (NYSE: T), which announced
last week that it will split itself into four parts.

NEWS TO GO

Health insurance company Aetna (NYSE: AET) announced
third-quarter earnings this morning. Operating earnings,
excluding onetime items, dropped to $158.1 million from $184.1
million last year. On a per-share basis, that translates into
$1.10 a share, versus $1.21 a year ago. Analysts were expecting
$0.90 a share. Revenues climbed 15% to $8.1 billion. In last
year's third quarter, Aetna's revenues were $7.1 billion.

Airborne Freight (NYSE: ABF) reported a third-quarter loss last
night that was greater than had been expected. The company lost
$5.5 million in the quarter, or $0.11 a share. It warned
analysts in September to look for a loss of between $0.05 and
$0.10 a share. Previously, analysts had expected a profit of
$0.28 a share. After the September warning, the consensus
estimate fell to a loss of $0.07 a share. Airborne Freight
blamed high fuel costs and softness in its core domestic
business for the shortfall. In last year's third quarter,
Airborne Freight earned $21.6 million, or $0.44 a share.

Broadband company Covered Communications (Nasdaq: COVD)
acknowledged today that CEO Robert Knowling will resign. This
comes just two weeks after Covad reported a wider-than-expected
loss for the third quarter. The company's stock has been pounded
this year, falling from a high of $66.63 to around $5 a share.
Frank Marshall, one of Covad's directors, has been named interim
CEO. Former chief and founder Charles McMinn will assume the
role of chairman.

Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC), the information technology
services company, announced that it's inked a $2.2 billion
agreement with British defense contractor BAE Systems. The
agreement is for six years and replaces a current agreement
between the two which expires in March 2004. Under the deal,
Computer Sciences will manage BAE's IT infrastructure in the
United Kingdom and here in the states.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

P&G COLORS ITSELF WITH CLAIROL
How big is the hair-coloring business? Judging by the number of
boxes on an average drugstore shelf, pretty big. That notion was
confirmed this morning as consumer products giant and FOOL 50
component Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) agreed to by the Clairol
business from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

AT&T (NYSE: T) said Friday that Cox Communications (NYSE: COX)
and Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSA) will keep their stakes in cable
Internet access company Excite@Home (Nasdaq: ATHM) rather than
sell them. In a remarkable deal, Cox and Comcast will not only
hold on to their shares of the broadband company --
majority-owned by AT&T -- but get more shares of the
telecommunications giant than they originally would have
received in exchange for getting out of Excite@Home. AT&T,
according to reports, stands to get a substantial tax benefit as
a result.

The FDA rejected Pharmacia's (NYSE: PHA) proposed Vestra
antidepressant, already sold elsewhere in the world as Edronax.
While disappointing, the drug's current worldwide sales are only
$100 million, small potatoes by Big Pharma standards. Pharmacia
would nevertheless like complements to its blockbuster Celebrex
arthritis drug, and the company has higher hopes for an FDA
panel's review planned for later this year.

Shrek, the computer-generated feature from privately held
Dreamworks, sent a warning shot across Disney's (NYSE: DIS) bow
this weekend by posting the best-ever opening by a non-sequel
animated feature and the second-best animated opening ever,
according to reports. The movie, which opened at the
second-largest number of theaters of any movie ever, will
(amazingly) be shown in more locations in the coming weeks
despite some theaters running shows at 45-minute intervals. As
someone who saw it, well, let's just say it's one for the
kiddies.

Insurer MetLife (NYSE: MET) Friday filed with the SEC to sell up
to $4 billion in common and preferred stock -- as well as other
forms of securities -- to fund operations. Todd Lebor took a
closer look at MetLife in a February column.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=412617

Federated Department Stores (NYSE: FD) said its board OK'd a
$500 million boost to its stock buyback plan, which had $250
million in authorized repurchases remaining. Federated could buy
the shares on the open market or through other transactions. In
other company news, Chairman and CEO James Zimmerman said Friday
that Federated was not one of the companies interested in buying
Brooks Brothers, as was reported in The London Times.

"Profundity of thought belongs to youth, clarity of thought to
old age." -- Friedrich Nietzsche


3M ADDS ANOTHER M
3M Post-It Note reads, "Reach out and MicroTouch someone."

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

4M? Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing (NYSE: MMM) will add
touchscreen specialist MicroTouch (Nasdaq: MTSI) to its
conglomerate in a $160 million acquisition.

For MicroTouch shareholders, the $21-a-share cash buyout price
finds the stock fetching levels it hasn't seen since 1997. The
landscape was much kinder then. Demand for the company's
touchscreen offerings ran high. Through 1998, sales growth was
running at an annualized clip of 35% over the five previous
years.

Then the fundamentals went insane in the resistive membrane. So
far this year the company has had to close down its Australian
office and look into fiduciary improprieties in Taiwan. The
company has divested itself of its once-promising Ibid digital
whiteboards and its Factura high-tech kiosks. The touchscreen
operations that remain have grown the top line by a paltry 5%
over the first nine months of the year.

http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=193905

Last week the company reported that it was engaged in sale
negotiations. 3M was a logical suitor since the company had
entered into the touchscreen market with its acquisition of
Dynapro Systems over the summer.

Dow component 3M trades at two times trailing revenues and it is
buying out MicroTouch at roughly the total sales over the past
year. But will the deal be accretive to the bottom line?
MicroTouch is struggling with profitability right now. But if 3M
is able to steer MicroTouch back into the operating groove the
company mastered in 1998, then, yes, definitely. The Post-It
reminder to pick up MicroTouch in order to become the top dog in
the touchscreen space will be worth it.

NEWS TO GO

Super Selection at Everyday Low Gross Margins! That's not the
official Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) slogan, but the company that Sam
Walton founded on producing financial results through whirlwind
inventory turnover on meager markups reported earnings in-line
with projections this morning. Sales climbed by 13% to $45.7
billion while earnings per share rose two pennies to $0.31 a
share -- a 6% gain. Uh-oh. That's falling net margins. However,
same-store sales climbed by 5% and the company's international
sales shot up 26%.

It's a big day for other retailers too. Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is
set to erect its quarterly report while Target (NYSE: TGT) has
its earnings conference call slated for 10:30 a.m. ET. After
yesterday's close, Too (NYSE: TOO) reported earnings that came
in a penny ahead of estimates. The specialty retailer that was
spun off by Limited (NYSE: LTD) also expressed comfort with the
December quarter forecasts.

Meanwhile, the investing community is fumbling for a Staples
(Nasdaq: SPLS) remover after the company reported earnings that
came in below analyst projections. The office supply superstore
chain also said that profits would fall short of expectations
for the current quarter. However, it does see growth of at least
30% next year.

Medic! The bleeding at WebMD (Nasdaq: HLTH) is running more
profuse than once feared. The company reported a
wider-than-expected loss for its quarterly checkup. As the
company begins to digest recent acquisitions, WebMD is looking
at a deficit next year of between $75 million and $100 million.
The prognosis calls for massive restructuring that finds the
company having to reduce previous revenue guidance for 2001.
Thankfully the company is cash-rich and debt-free. No one is
calling Dr. Koop for a second opinion, yet.

Stop the presses -- Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is buying a company.
OK, keep the presses rolling, the networking titan does this all
the time. The target of Cisco's affections is Australian
high-speed chipset developer Radiata in a $295 million
transaction. Onward.

INTUIT'S DOING MORE WITH LESS
Personal finance software vendor Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU) beat
lowered third-quarter earnings expectations yesterday, but said
full-year revenues would come in at the bottom end of earlier
guidance. Intuit posted pro forma profits of $0.55 per share,
beating Wall Street's expectation by two pennies. Revenues were
$425.2 million, below Wall Street's estimate of $435 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL), best known for its server operating
system, announced a second-quarter pro forma loss of $0.03 per
share, versus earnings of $0.02 per share in the year-ago
period. Wall Street expected earnings of $0.03 per share.
Revenue was $240.8 million, compared with $302.3 million in the
year-ago period. Novell is also cutting 5% of its workforce. The
layoffs, coupled with additional savings in travel, advertising,
and recruiting, are expected to return the company to
profitability.

Business-to-business software vendor Agile Software (Nasdaq:
AGIL) announced a fourth-quarter pro forma loss of $0.05 per
share, compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in the year-ago
period, and in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Revenue
increased 140% year-over-year to $26 million. Agile makes
software that allows companies to exchange information over the
Internet. Last month, Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) called off its
acquisition of the company.

Computer Associates (NYSE: CA), the world's third-largest
software company, posted pro forma pro rata income (i.e.,
results that are adjusted to allow the effects of a new sales
model to be compared against past numbers) of $0.47 per share,
compared to $0.34 per share in the year-ago period. That beat
Wall Street's estimate by a penny. Pro forma pro rata revenue
increased 3.6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.

Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) maintained its
full-year guidance and reported first-quarter earnings of $0.40
per share, compared with $0.24 per share in the year-ago period.
Sales came in at $240.9 million, compared with $148.5 million in
the year-ago period. While other chipmakers are struggling,
shares of Nvidia have grown nearly twofold since January. In the
press release, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the company's
entrance into the mobile and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) markets.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q.  What do you think of viaticals as investments?

-- A. Viatical settlements have grown in popularity in recent
years. But they're not without risk and they may make some
people uncomfortable.

Viatical settlements are when a terminally ill person sells his
or her life insurance policy to someone else. Imagine John,
stricken with a fatal form of cancer. He's 36 and is expected to
live only three more years. If he needs cash to pay for medical
bills or just to spend and enjoy, he might sell his life
insurance policy to Jane. If it's set to pay $100,000 on his
death, Jane might pay $66,000 for it. That way he gets a lot of
cash now and Jane expects to get the $100,000 in about three
years. At that rate, she'd be earning roughly a 15 percent
annual return.

There are many risks, though. John may hang on for seven years,
significantly reducing Jane's return. Indeed, a cure for his
cancer might be discovered. John may even outlive Jane! It's
true that these settlements can provide a service for sick
people, but they're not necessarily win-win. The middlemen
arranging these settlements take cuts. Also, if John lives, he's
without his life insurance policy and few insurers will want to
insure him, as he's been so sick recently.

We're uneasy about investing in something that has us rooting
for speedy deaths and against medical breakthroughs. Also, there
have been many instances of fraud with viaticals.

-- Q. What does "shrinkage" mean in the business world?

-- A. It refers to the loss of inventory that happens through
usual ways, such as accidental breakage, theft, weather damage,
etc.

INVESTING BASICS - IN THE MARGINS

If you're new to investing, you've probably stared at an income
statement (sometimes called a statement of operations) and
scratched your head, wondering what it's telling you. Let us
help.

First, understand that the income statement summarizes sales and
profits over a period of time. It might cover three months or a
year, for example. It will usually offer information for the
year-ago period as well, so you can compare the two and spot
trends.

Here's a slightly dated but nevertheless interesting example.
Let's look at Eskimo Pie Corp.'s income statement for fiscal
year 1998. At the top, as with every income statement, you'll
find net sales (sometimes called revenues). For Eskimo Pie,
they're $63.5 million.

>From now on, as we work down the income statement, various costs
will be subtracted from the revenues, leaving different levels
of profit. The item you'll find just under revenues is "cost of
goods sold" (abbreviated as COGS and sometimes called cost of
sales), which represents the cost of producing the products or
services sold. For Eskimo Pie it's $37.4 million. Subtract the
COGS from revenues, and you'll get a gross profit of $26.1
million.

To find the gross profit margin, simply divide the gross profit
by revenues. $26.1 million divided by $63.5 million yields a
gross margin of 41 percent. (Compare results with industry
peers. For example, at a similar time, gross margin was 35
percent for Ben & Jerry's, which has a somewhat different
business model.)

Next, the remaining costs involved in operating the business,
such as support staff salaries, utility bills and advertising
expenses, are subtracted, leaving the operating profit. Eskimo
Pie's operating profit is $1.8 million. Divide this by revenues,
and you get a slim operating margin of 2.8 percent. This reveals
the profitability of the company's principal business. (Ben &
Jerry's: 4.3 percent.)

Finally, after items such as taxes and interest payments are
accounted for, we come to net income, near the bottom of the
statement. Eskimo Pie's is $0.8 million. Divide that by revenues
and you get a net profit margin of 1.3 percent. (Ben & Jerry's:
3 percent.) The last part of the income statement is where the
company divides its net income by shares outstanding, to arrive
at earnings per share (EPS).

That's it!

"To be an adult is to disappoint others." -- Unknown


IBM, INTEL ANNOUNCE CHIP ADVANCES
HOW SMALL AND FAST CAN THEY GO? VERY AND VERY.
Intel's transistors will be three atoms thick.

By Tom Jacobs

Chip giants IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) both
announced breakthrough chip technologies. IBM has started using
a new manufacturing technology, while Intel promises transistors
as small as three atoms thick, making chips almost seven times
faster than its recently released Pentium 4.

IBM's new manufacturing technique, named CMOS-9S, showcases
advances in copper wiring, silicon-on-insulator transistors, and
better insulation so that chip circuits can be as small as 0.13
microns -- 800 times thinner than a human hair. IBM is making a
variety of chips with this technique, and customers should
receive their first shipments in early 2001.

But Intel now plans the world's smallest and fastest CMOS
transistor. At 30 nanometers thick, the Santa Clara gorilla
could fit 400 million of them on a chip, which is just shy of 10
times the number on a Pentium 4. Intel says that it will be
possible to build chips by 2005 that run 10 billion operations a
second, compared to the Pentium 4's 1.5 billion a second. Dr.
Sunlin Chu, vice president and general manager of Intel's
Technology and Manufacturing Group, said that new processors
using the transistors not only would be smaller and faster, but
use less power. He said, "It's one thing to achieve a great
technological breakthrough. It's another to have one that is
practical and will change everyone's lives. With Intel's 30
nanometer transistor, we have both."
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D237380

While industry observers believe that this advance approaches
the limit on thickness, Jim Hardy, an analyst at Dataquest, says
that "This is proving there's no reason the normal growth of the
semiconductor industry can't continue on for probably another 10
years." If so, that's good news for Intel investors, who have
endured recent Intel revenue warnings and stock price
cliff-drops. Fools recently dueled over its future.

Intel closed at $34.00 Friday, down from a 52-week high of
$75.81, while IBM finished at $97.00, off its year high of
$134.94.

NEWS TO GO

U.K. drug maker Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC (Nasdaq: SHPGY)
will buy Canadian biotech pharmaceutical company BioChem Pharma
Inc. (Nasdaq: BCHE) for $4 billion in stock. Shire will pay $37
a BioChem share, a 40% premium over the company=01,s $26.50 Friday
close. Shire looks to expand beyond its key niche in
hyperactivity drugs, which comprise half of Shire's revenues but
face increasing competition. Shire will pick up BioChem's
successful Epivir AIDS treatment, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome
(NYSE: GLX), but also BioChem=01,s Zeffix Hepatitis B treatment,
which has been disappointing.

All eyes watch tomorrow's start of the U.S. wireless spectrum
auction, with pessimists observing the big telecom lemming march
over the cliff into Debt Sea. To improve its chances, AT&T
Wireless (NYSE: AWE) has partnered with three Native Alaskan
corporations so it can bid for "closed" frequencies set aside
solely for small companies. Created in 1971 to settle Alaska
natives' land claims, the corporations -- whose phenomenal
success was portrayed popularly on TV=01,s Northern Exposure --
operate with little oversight and invest in natural resources,
tourism, and other businesses in Alaska and throughout the lower
48 states. The companies, together with AT&T, paid $240 million
to participate in the auction, 13% of the $1.8 billion paid for
the chance to seek more licenses. Cingular Wireless and Verizon
(NYSE: VZ) also partnered with small companies for the same
reason. The FCC will auction 422 licenses in 195 markets, and
estimates of the auction's take range from $10 billion to $18
billion.

Morgan Stanley Capital International, a division of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD), said Sunday that it would
change the weighting it gives companies in its benchmark
indices. MSCI plans to weigh stocks in its indices according to
market cap based on free float -- shares actually available for
sale -- not total shares outstanding. This is expected to hurt
companies that have a high percentage of shares owned by
families, government, management, or other restricted company
holdings. With an estimated $200 billion in sales and purchases
expected when the indices change beginning November 30, 2001 and
ending May 31, 2002, analysts expect U.S. and U.K companies to
benefit, with Japanese, German, and French companies to suffer.
MSCI will exclude any company whose free float is less than 15%
of its total.

Bloomberg reports that the Federal Government's Copyright
Office, part of the Library of Congress, will publish a final
executive branch administrative rule today requiring that U.S.
radio stations pay royalties to record companies when the
stations broadcast on the Internet. About 4,000 of 14,000 U.S.
radio stations rebroadcast, or Web cast, on the Internet.
Spokespersons for the National Association of Broadcasters
decried the decision, which they say will add "tens of millions
of dollars" to the already $300 million in fees paid to
composers and publishers. Websites also assert that a related
Copyright Office decision allows them to negotiate blanket
licenses without having to negotiate with each record company,
as can radio stations that have limited customer involvement but
not individualized programming. The record industry disputes the
distinction between consumer-influenced ("play my fave song")
versus individualized programming, and promises to fight.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you "bought" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D168092

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, "Rules for
Revolutionaries" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D168095

1. "Don't worry, be crappy." Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. "Eat your own dog food." This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. "Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant." (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.

If you're looking for a well-written, engaging book to help you
stay on the cutting edge of the best thinking and writing on
personal finance and investing, keep an eye out for Jester Award
winners. To nominate any book for a Jester Award, drop an e-mail

"No man is great by imitation." -- Samuel Johnson


BROCADE COMMUNICATIONS FACES A TOUGH MARKET
The company's solid earnings report yesterday may not be
rewarded by increasingly skittish investors.

By Chris Rugaber

Storage network infrastructure company Brocade Communications
(Nasdaq: BRCD) reported a fourfold increase in revenues after
yesterday's market close, and beat analysts' earnings estimates,
but the company's shares declined in after-hours trading anyway.

Sales for the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which ended
October 28, rocketed upward to $132.1 million, from $30.1
million in the year-earlier period. Net income increased to
$27.2 million, from only $3.9 million a year ago. Earnings per
share jumped to $0.22, from last year's $0.03 per share, ahead
of consensus estimates of $0.20 per share. The company also
announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will take effect on
December 22, its third split since it became a public company in
May 1999.

Brocade makes switches and other equipment for data storage
networks, and has rapidly increased its market share, from about
30% a year ago to almost 60% today. The company's stock has
grown almost as quickly, up about 75% for the year as of
yesterday's close. The shares have declined in recent weeks,
along with several other data storage companies, due to concerns
over valuation, slowing economic growth, and increasing
competition in the data storage market.

Nevertheless, Brocade is quite bullish about its future. The
company projects revenue will grow 150% to $830 million in
fiscal 2001, and that gross margins will remain at 60%. The
company's CEO, Greg Reyes, noted that "We just happen to be
serving a market segment that is one of the fastest-growing
market segments on the face of the planet and what I think will
emerge as the next major networking category."

Despite the positive results, the company's shares, which fell
4.5% yesterday in advance of the earnings report, traded down
further in after-hours activity, as investors become
increasingly nervous about richly valued technology stocks. As
one analyst told Reuters, "I would think [the stock price] would
go up, but oh well.... The market environment we are in is not
normal.''

For more information on the data storage industry, check out the
Fool's computer hardware sector page. In addition, data storage
software companies are analyzed in this year's Industry Focus.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE
GATEWAY WARNS OF DOWNBEAT Q4, 2001
By David Marino-Nachison
PC direct seller Gateway (NYSE: GTW) has historically looked
forward to a strong start to the holiday selling season, but
that didn't happen this year. Now the company not only forecasts
a disappointing fourth quarter but upcoming year as well. FULL STORY>>>
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220745
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Telecom giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and NTT DoCoMo officially
announced their widely rumored partnership today, with the
Japanese mobile communications services provider agreeing to
purchase 16% of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE) for $9.8 billion. AT&T
Wireless, currently a tracking stock, will receive $6.2 billion
and AT&T will receive $3.6 billion in cash. The purchase values
AT&T Wireless at $23.50 per share, a 31% premium over
yesterday's closing price. DoCoMo, which means "everywhere" in
Japanese, has been taking minority stakes in wireless service
providers around the world as part of its strategy to extend its
services internationally. The two companies also announced that
AT&T Wireless would form a wholly owned subsidiary to develop
mobile data and multimedia services similar to DoCoMo's wildly
successful i-mode service. AT&T Wireless, the third-largest
wireless service provider in the U.S., also said it would
introduce third-generation (3G) data services in 2002, using the
same W-CDMA standard that DoCoMo is planning to use.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=220746

Leading local phone company Verizon (NYSE: VZ) yesterday
announced that it has canceled plans to buy a majority stake in
floundering DSL provider NorthPoint Communications (Nasdaq:
NPNT), after NorthPoint restated third-quarter financial results
on November 20, lowering sales by about 20%. Like its fellow DSL
provider Covad Communications (Nasdaq: COVD), which also reduced
previously announced sales earlier this month, NorthPoint blamed
the restatement on non-payment from financially strapped
customers. Nevertheless, Verizon believes it can terminate the
deal as a result of the changes in NorthPoint's business and
financial condition. NorthPoint's CEO said that she may seek
"legal remedies."

Struggling retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) fell in after-hours trading
upon reporting a 1% same-store sales drop for the month of
November, thanks largely to declines in its Banana Republic and
Old Navy stores. The company also said that it is "cautious" in
its outlook about next quarter's sales and earnings. Gap's
earnings have fallen for the past two quarters.

Programmable computer chip maker Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) yesterday
warned for the second time this month that revenues would slow
in upcoming quarters, causing the company's shares to fall
sharply in after-hours trading. The company said in a conference
call that sales for the fiscal fourth quarter would be flat
sequentially, and that first-quarter 2001 sales would increase
less than 5%, down from an 84% revenue increase in the third
quarter. Overall, the company estimates that revenues for fiscal
2001 will grow 35%, below current estimates for 49% growth for
the year. The company blamed inventory buildup at contract
manufacturers for the slowdown. "November was an awful month,"
said CEO Rodney Smith.

"The shopping bag ladies -- it's hard to believe, but once they
were children." -- Dean Friedman


DOUBLECLICK'S DOUBLE TAKE
Online advertising powerhouse DoubleClick warns. Figures.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

It was simply a matter of when. DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK),
along with fellow online marketers Engage (Nasdaq: ENGA) and
24/7 Media (Nasdaq: TFSM), had already announced layoffs over
the past few weeks. Clearly the once-hot Internet advertising
niche had run ice-cold. Pink slips and economic booms rarely go hand-in-hand.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=239420

So when DoubleClick set up a conference call yesterday after the
market's close, it didn't take much of a guess to know what the
company had to say. It wasn't even a matter of when anymore.
DoubleClick lowered projections for both the December and
January quarters.

Surprised? Not really. It's like pulling up to your house on
your birthday to find a dozen cars parked on your front lawn and
a chorus of hushes as you approach the door.

This surprise party might only startle the Rip Van Winkle who
had last checked DoubleClick's pulse after its September quarter
performance. The company had reported its first profit at the
time and expected similar bottom-line results this quarter. Now
fourth-quarter revenues are expected to come in between $126
million and $129 million -- well off the $140 million previously
projected. Earnings will be breakeven at best.

A wider loss than expected will follow in March. However,
DoubleClick still believes that 2001 will be a profitable year.

Surprised at the long-term stroke of optimism? You shouldn't be.
True, nearly half of DoubleClick's revenues come from dot-com
companies. In many cases, today's clients will line the
corporate obituaries tomorrow as they struggle with cash burn
rates in non-profitable enterprises that the market is no longer
interested in subsidizing. However, one can't deny the lure of
online marketing in the bricks-and-mortar world.

Internet usage is still growing by leaps and bounds. That is
something that can't be said of traditional advertising channels
such as print, television and billboards. The online medium also
provides a more effective way to target an ad recipient.
Probably even more important, in leaner economic times where ad
budgets need to be justified, the success of an Internet
marketing campaign can be effectively measured.

So, sure, these are dark times right now. But for investors
willing to turn the key and step inside, bright lights,
welcoming smiles, and wrapped gifts might be waiting on the
other side.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Gamblers know to fold 'em when the chips are down. Well,
gamblers, the chips are down. Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS),
Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP), and Advanced Micro Devices
(NYSE: AMD) reported that quarterly results will come in below
analyst estimates. The chipmakers are blaming a softness in
sales for the shortcoming.

The same can't be said for General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Sonic
(Nasdaq: SONC). Both companies reassured investors that earnings
are on track. GE is comfortable with the year ahead. The
burgermeisters at Sonic are comfortable with first-quarter
estimates despite a slowdown in traffic at the drive-in units.

According to this morning's Washington Post, struggling Internet
service provider PSINet (Nasdaq: PSIX) will be laying off 300
employees. Fittingly pronounced "sigh Net," the struggling
provider has seen its shares crash to under $2 from a high just
above $60 a share back in March. Growing revenues at the expense
of mounting losses just doesn't cut it nowadays.

Take a picture, it'll last longer. For the second time this
quarter, Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK) has had to reduce profit
forecasts. The photography giant is now expecting full-year
profits to come in lower than the year before. Hoping to shred
the negatives, the company is embarking on a cost-cutting
crusade that will reduce capital spending, SKUs, and inventory
levels. No enlargements.

"We don't know a millionth of one percent about anything."
-- Thomas Edison


COPPER MOUNTAIN GETS HALVED
Copper Mountain, the provider of digital subscriber line
solutions, reported its Q3 earnings yesterday, along with some
bad news about its Q4.

By LouAnn Lofton

Digital subscriber line (DSL) solutions provider Copper Mountain
Networks (Nasdaq: CMTN) announced its third-quarter results
yesterday after the bell. The company also provided some
guidance for its fourth quarter and for its next fiscal year
that sent its stock tumbling more than 50% to around $12 in
after-hours trading. Copper Mountain closed in regular trading
yesterday at $26.88, far below the 52-week high it reached back
in July of $125.72.

For its third quarter, Copper Mountain had revenues of $93.5
million, 192% ahead of the $32 million it earned in the same
quarter a year ago. Pro forma net income, which excludes two
charges, was $15.8 million. The company's net income last year
in the third quarter was $5.3 million.

Copper Mountain's pro forma earnings per diluted share came in a
penny ahead of the consensus estimate at $0.27. Third-quarter
earnings per share a year ago were $0.09.

Now, for the stuff that sent the company's stock plummeting in
after-hours trading. Rick Gilbert, Copper Mountain's president
and chief executive officer, said, "In light of recent
reductions in capital expenditure forecasts from many of our
CLEC [Competitive Local Exchange Carriers] customers, we expect
revenue and earnings to decline in the fourth quarter of 2000 on
a sequential basis."

Just how big will the "decline" be? Copper Mountain now expects
sales to be $60 million for the fourth quarter. It sees pro
forma earnings per share coming in between $0.04 and $0.06.
Analysts had been looking for $0.28 a share.

Gilbert went on to talk about his company's expected fiscal 2001
results. While pointing out that giving guidance that far out is
very difficult, he said he expects sales for fiscal 2001 to be
between $300 million and $330 million. Earnings per share should
be between $0.16 and $0.25. Street analysts were expecting $1.37
a share for Copper Mountain's fiscal 2001.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

INTEL VS. ADVANCED MICRO
By Brian Lund
Intel's revenue warning in September turned out to be cosmetic.
Revenue growth was still strong, margins improved meaningfully,
and earnings came in at original expectations. Intel continues
to dominate its main competitor, AMD.
FULL STORY
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=159576
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

RF Micro Devices (Nasdaq: RFMD), the wireless communications
amplifying chip maker, announced its second-quarter earnings
yesterday, and also talked about its expected third-quarter
results. For its Q2, the company met estimates with $0.10 a
share. Net income was $17.7 million on revenues of $102.2
million. Last year in the second quarter, RF Micro Devices
earned $12.5 million on revenues of $68.9 million, or $0.07. The
company then said it was lowering expectations for the third
quarter because of low demand for its products, as well as
product delays. It expects earnings per share to be between
$0.04 and $0.05 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.11 a
share.

International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) reported its
third-quarter earnings after the market's close yesterday. Sales
grew by 3% to $21.8 billion. This wasn't enough to satisfy
analysts, who were looking for sales to come in at $22.4
billion. Net income for the quarter rose to $2 billion, from
$1.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share
were $1.08, versus $0.90 a share last year. This EPS number met
the consensus estimate as reported by First Call/Thompson
Financial. IBM blamed at least some of the weak revenue growth
on an anemic euro. The company claimed its sales would have
risen 6% without those negative currency effects.

Chip maker Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) announced its second-quarter
earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's revenues grew
83% to $437.4 million, from $238.8 million in its second quarter
last year. Net income was $114.1 million, compared to $59.2
million a year ago. Earnings per share beat the consensus
estimate by two cents, coming in at $0.32, versus $0.17 last
year.

Handspring (Nasdaq: HAND) reported its first-quarter results
yesterday afternoon. The company's loss was narrower than
expected. Excluding some deferred stock compensation costs,
Handspring lost $8 million, or $0.08 a share. Analysts polled by
First Call/Thompson Financial expected it to lose $0.12 a share.
Including those costs, the company lost $0.17 a share, or $16.4
million. Handspring's revenues for the quarter were $70.5
million.

Covad Communications Group (Nasdaq: COVD) announced its
third-quarter earnings results yesterday. Revenues were $66.7
million, compared to revenues in the year-ago period of $19.1
million. Covad's net loss was $189.9 million, versus a loss of
$54.1 million the year before. The company's net loss of $1.22
per share was greater than the consensus estimate of $1.18 per
share. In Covad's third quarter last year, it lost $0.47 a
share. Covad's chief executive officer, Robert Knowling, pointed
to his company's clients as the reason the shortfall. "Due to
the weakness in the capital markets, nine of our channel
partners have experienced financing difficulties and have
slipped in their ability to stay current with their accounts
receivable. To conservatively account for this, despite billing
$78.1 million in revenue for the third quarter, only $66.7
million was recorded."

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. What's an order imbalance?

A. Order imbalances happen on stock exchanges such as the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) when there are too many buy orders
and not enough sell orders -- or vice versa. When they occur,
the exchange might halt trading temporarily, to allow more of
the other kind of order to come in. This permits better matching
of buyers and sellers, and makes prices less volatile.

You might see order imbalances happen whenever there's very good
or bad news related to a company and suddenly many people want
in or out of it.

The Nasdaq stock market, meanwhile, operates on more of a
supply-and-demand basis, with its trading conducted between many
market participants. It doesn't halt trading for order
imbalances.


Q. Don't you think that anyone who doesn't sell a stock near its
all-time high is a fool?

A. A Fool with a capital "F," maybe, but not an idiot. It's true
that many stocks are now down considerably from their all-time
highs. But few stocks ever go up in a straight line. And any
stock that continually rises will continually set all-time
highs. It's not consistently possible to know what a stock will
do in the short term, so we avoid trying to carefully time
purchases or sales.

If you're ever holding onto stock in a company whose future
doesn't look too bright or stock that seems grossly overvalued,
you might do well to sell But those of us who have long-term
faith in a company and expect its price to be significantly
higher in the decades ahead, we'll often do well just happily
hanging on. Many volatile but solid stocks have often been
halved, only to double and quadruple again.

Foolish Question message board.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

COMMON FINANCIAL MISTAKES

Be smart about managing your money. Here are some common
financial mistakes, and a few resources to help you avoid them:

- Racking up credit card debt. It feels like free money, but it
  isn't. High interest rates increase your debt, making it harder
  and harder to pay off. That's reverse investing! Remedy: Find
  our nine ways to pay it back.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409221

- Not investing soon enough. You're rarely too young or too old
  to invest. Kids have the most to gain from many decades of stock
  appreciation. But even retirees can benefit from leaving in
  stocks whatever money they won't need for five or ten years.
  Remedy: See how you can start investing with only $20 a month.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409222

- Investing too conservatively. Any long-term investment is
  likely to grow most rapidly in stocks.

- Over- or under-diversifying. If all your eggs are in two or
  three baskets, you're exposed to too much risk. If you have too
  many baskets to count, then you probably aren't able to keep up
  with each company. Between five and 15 stocks is a manageable
  number for most people. . Remedy: Index funds are a great place
  to start.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409223

- Focusing inordinately on a stock's price. Contrary to popular
  opinion, a "cheap" stock isn't a bargain. Penny stocks, those
  trading for less than $5 each, are risky and dangerous. A $150
  stock can actually be a bargain, and if your funds are limited,
  you can always just buy a few shares.

- Investing in what you don't understand. The more familiar you
  are with how your company works and how well it's performing,
  the fewer unpleasant surprises you're likely to encounter.

- Relying on the advice of others. It's great to learn from
  others, but ultimately you should make your own decisions.
  You're the one who cares the most about your finances.

- Not tracking your returns. Shrug off this duty at your own
  peril. You always want to be (in the long run) beating a
  benchmark such as the S&P 500. If you're not beating it, you
  might as well meet it, by investing in an index fund. Remedy:
  Track your portfolio for free on our website.
  http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409224

- Impatience. Building great wealth takes time.

Perhaps the worst mistake is never taking the time to learn
about investing. You're not making that one, though, if you're
reading and thinking about this article!

JDS UNIPHASE'S WHITE-HOT Q1
The optical networking component maker's fiscal Q1 earnings came
in looking strong. Will they be enough to reverse this week's
mass sell-off in the sector?


By Dave Marino-Nachison

An upbeat fiscal first-quarter earnings report from fiber optic
components leader JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JSDU) following last
night's bell perked up investors in after-hours trading, pumping
the stock 12%, after a 25% plummet on Wednesday. JDSU and other
fiber optics companies, such as Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
and Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN), have been capsized by the wake of
Nortel's (NYSE: NT) earnings report from earlier in the week.
(Nortel is a major customer of JDSU.)

Nortel's optical networking division didn't grow as quickly as
some analysts hoped, which compounded another recent
disappointment from Lucent (NYSE: LU). But Rule Maker JDSU's
results sparkled: Revenues rose 171% year-over-year and, at $785
million, overcame the projections of market watchers. Pro forma
net income rose 29% to $0.18 per share, beating Street forecasts
by two pennies.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171083
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171084

Now JDSU expects to earn $0.80 per share -- a dime better than
expected -- for the fiscal year, CFO Tony Muller reportedly said
on a conference call. He also pointed investors toward top-line
growth of between 115% and 120%. "Optical demand is good and
healthy," a Robertson Stephens analyst told Bloomberg.

"We believe demand remains strong,'' COO Charles Abbe was quoted
as saying. He maintains the company isn't seeing the inventory
channel grow fat at the expense of future sales: "We can't find
any meaningful evidence of an industry slowdown.'' Look for Q2
pro forma earnings of $0.19 or $0.20 per share, execs said,
compared with $0.17 as projected by Wall Street.

While short-term market movements are of little interest to
Fools, today's trading should prove interesting as investors
work to make sense of the recent rash of seemingly conflicting
indications. While some might say the fiber optic sector was
merely due for a "correction" of sorts, of greater importance
are clues about the sort of demand that lies ahead to justify or
confound even today's damaged -- but still extremely high --
valuations.

Demand for the components that speed data transmissions and
fatten networks to meet skyrocketing bandwidth needs isn't
expected to slow significantly for the next several years. For
more information, check out a column Richard McCaffery wrote
back in July.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=171085
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Kellogg (NYSE: K) agreed to buy Keebler Foods (NYSE: KBL) for
$3.86 billion, or $42 a share, a 4.4% premium over Keebler's
$40.44 close yesterday. Kellogg will triple its debt load to
swallow Keebler, but buying the No. 2 cookie and cracker maker
helps it diversify its core breakfast cereals business, which
has seen no growth for a decade. Keebler and No. 1 snack maker
Nabisco Holdings Corp. (NYSE: NA) compete in a market growing at
4% a year. Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) will join its Kraft division
with its planned purchase of Nabisco Holdings, not to be
confused with Nabisco Group Holdings (NYSE: NGH), to be
purchased by R.J. Reynolds (NYSE: RJR).

Leading biopharmaceutical company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) reported
a pro forma 12% increase in revenues and an 18% increase in
earnings for the quarter ending September 30. However, the
company forecasted slower sales for its two main revenue
producers, Epogen and Neupogen, and said that approval of its
Kineret rheumatoid arthritis treatment could be delayed until
the second half of next year. Amgen's shares dropped to $59.50
in after-market trading, from $68.50 at the day's close.

Big-shot hedge fund manager Jeffrey Vinik announced that he was
returning most of the $4.2 billion in assets of Vinik Asset
Management so he can spend more time with his family. Most
investors remember Vinik, 41, as the manager appointed to
replace legendary Peter Lynch at Fidelity's Magellan Fund. Vinik
Asset Management reportedly turned in a four-year 645% return to
investors, 440% after fees.

Beleaguered Belgian voice recognition software maker Lernout &
Hauspie Speech Products (Nasdaq: LHSP) announced it would
resolve confidentiality agreements and release to Securities and
Exchange Commission and European Easdaq exchange investigators
the names of 30 investors in closely held companies that Lernout
says are customers. These Belgian and Singaporean companies
figure prominently into accusations of impropriety concerning
Lernout's Asian divisions' revenues. The Wall Street Journal has
run several stories hitting the company hard for alleged
questionable accounting, but the company has maintained that its
practices are legal and common in Europe, but misunderstood by
Americans. The disclosure news sank the stock price another 35%.

FRANCE LUCENT?
Last month, Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) CEO Serge Tchurek said that a
Lucent (NYSE: LU) asset sale "is a determining event for all the
actors in this market." Apparently, the French
telecommunications equipment giant wants to play more than a bit
part in this epic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It's a day that will live in blockbuster infamy. Disney's (NYSE:
DIS) Pearl Harbor failed to live up to the hype as the film that
would finally topple 1997's Jurassic Park's The Lost World from
the top slot of the four-day opening weekend. The movie still
nailed a respectable $75 million in estimated box office ticket
sales. I'll be taking a closer look at how the summer multiplex
season is playing out later today.

Talk about your Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) pilots! Hewlett-Packard
(NYSE: HWP) and accounting titan PricewaterhouseCoopers
announced that they would team up to provide consulting services
to the airline industry on how to introduce handheld computers
and the Internet into the work space. Is improving communication
services the key to air carrier efficiency? Maybe. Now let's see
them do something about that bland airline food.

The chips are down. That might not be much of a surprise to semi
watchers, but a closer glimpse into the industry's slump was
warranted. According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics
group, global chip sales are expected to fall by 14% this year
from last year's $204 billion showing.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I've just learned that Levi Strauss is a private company,
so I can't buy shares of it. What other major companies are
privately held?

-- A. Take a gander at these biggies: Cargill, Mars, Bertelsmann
AG, Bechtel, Publix Supermarkets, IKEA International, Amway,
Penske, S.C. Johnson & Sons, Montgomery Ward Holding Co.,
Packard Bell NEC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hallmark Cards, Borden,
McCain Foods, Hyatt, Hechinger and Domino's Pizza. Some of these
firms offer shares to employees, but individual investors are
out of luck.

-- Q. I've noticed that stocks jump in price when they're added
to the S&P 500 Index. Why is this, and is there any way to learn
which companies will be added in the future?

-- A. You've noticed correctly. When it was announced recently
that America Online would be added to the S&P 500, its shares
quickly rose about 12 percent.

Stocks get added to these indexes to replace ones deemed no
longer worthy of being included, or ones that have merged with
other companies and therefore disappear. The announcements draw
the attention of investors, sending share prices up. And once
the companies are added, index funds that will have to own these
stocks begin snapping up shares.

Unfortunately, the stocks begin moving as soon as the
announcements are made, before they're even officially added. So
there's little time to sneak in and benefit. But if you've
invested in high-quality, growing companies, chances are you may
eventually see some of them added to important indexes.

area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question
discussion board.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - STOCK SPLITS

Wondering whether to buy a stock before or after a split is like
asking, "Should I eat this peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich
before or after Mom cuts it in half?

Stocks don't become more inexpensive when they split. True, you
get more shares. But each is worth less. Imagine you own 100
shares of Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN). They're
trading at $60 each and total $6,000. When Sisyphus splits
2-for-1, you'll own 200 shares, worth about $30 each. Total
value: (drum roll, please) $6,000. Yawn.

Some people drool over stocks about to split, thinking the price
will surge. Stock prices sometimes do pop a little on news of
splits. But these are artificial moves, sustainable only if the
businesses grow to justify them. The real reason to smile at a
split announcement is because it signals that management is
bullish. They're not likely to split their stock if they expect
the price to go down.

Splits come in many varieties, such as 3-for-2 or 4-for-1.
There's even a "reverse split," when you end up with fewer
shares, with each worth more. Reverse splits are usually
employed by companies in trouble, to avoid looking like the
penny stocks they are. If a stock is trading at a
red-flag-raising $2 per share and it does a reverse 1-for-10
split, the price will rise to $20 and those who held 100 shares
will then own 10.

Companies often split their stock so that the price will remain
psychologically appealing. Sometimes, not splitting would mean
that few people could afford even a single share. If Microsoft
hadn't split seven times in the last decade, each share would be
worth more than $6,500.

With stocks, just as with any purchase, examine what you're
getting for the price. Study the company and compare the stock
price to other numbers, such as earnings. A low price might be
inviting, but a $200 stock can be much more of a bargain than a
$20 one. If your funds are limited, you can just buy fewer
shares.

It's always fun to suddenly own more shares, but splits are like
getting change for a dollar. They're not cause for celebration.

financial independence.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I want to open a brokerage account, but the firms I called
require between $1,000 and $5,000 upfront, just to open an
account. What can I do?

-- A. Many brokerages don't have minimums. Details about and
ratings for scores of discount brokerages, both traditional and
online, can be found in SmartMoney magazine, the American
Association of Individual Investors Journal and other
periodicals. Online brokerages are also reviewed and rated at
gomez.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196114

Note that commissions for discount brokerages have fallen to as
low as $5 or $10 per trade. (And some of them are offering free
trades to those with certain minimum balances.) This is a far
cry from the typical discount commission of $30 to $50 a few
years ago and the hundreds of dollars that some full-service
brokerages will still charge you today.

-- Q. I'm 14 years old. How much risk should I apply to what I'm
investing?

-- A. We love questions like this! If only all 14-year olds were
learning about investing.

Anyone can afford to take on some risk by investing in stocks --
as long as the money won't be withdrawn within the next five or
more years. If the money you're investing is for college, stocks
aren't a good idea, as the market could drop in the short term.
Those investing for the long haul can patiently ride out
downturns. Short-term investors should stick to safer plays,
like money market funds.

You're smart to start young. Let's say you invest $500 and it
earns the average annual market rate of 11 percent. In 30 years,
when you're only 44, it'll become $11,446. Sock it away until
retirement at 65 and it'll be nearly $100,000. Add to it over
the years and you're looking at early retirement!

area or post your question on the Ask a Foolish Question

INVESTING BASICS - CALLING ALL WOMEN

If you know a woman who isn't yet investing, clip out this
article and pass it on to her. She may thank you one day from
the bottom of her wallet.

Many women (and men, too) are steering clear of the stock
market, and they're paying a high price for it. Consider these
facts. Wives tend to be less involved than husbands in household
investing and retirement planning. Most married women outlive
their husbands. Fully 80 percent of all widows in poverty became
poor only after the death of their husbands. In 1992, 87 percent
of the elderly poor in America were women.

If we've now depressed you, hold on. There's good news, too.
More women are investing today than in the past. A 1997 study
commissioned by the National Association of Securities Dealers
found that 47 percent of investors were women, up from 37
percent in 1990.

When women invest, they can do very well. According to recent
National Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC) statistics, the
average annual lifetime return for all-women investment clubs
was 17.9 percent, compared with 15.6 percent for all-men clubs
(in 1997). Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, professors at the
University of California at Davis business school, offer an
explanation. In a 1998 study, they found that men are more
likely than women to be overconfident and to trade frequently.
Single men, for example, traded 67 percent more than single
women, reaping lower returns.

Here are some guidelines for women -- and heck, men --
interested in getting started:

1. Take the time to learn first. Don't jump into any investment
without understanding it and being comfortable with it. Read
"One Up on Wall Street" by Peter Lynch or our "You Have More
Than You Think."
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196117
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D196118

2. Don't be afraid to take on some risk. Sticking to low-risk
choices like bonds or money market funds dooms you to lower
returns. As long as you're investing for five to ten or more
years, you can afford to ride out any short-term market
downturns.

3. Consider forming an investment club. Learn how with the NAIC
at better-investing.org.

TOP STORY

PEPSICO'S REFRESHING Q1
Soda and salty-snack giant PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) reported
first-quarter financial results this morning, turning in
earnings that beat Wall Street's forecast by a penny at $0.34
per share, up from last year's $0.29. Companywide revenues
improved 8.5% to $4.5 billion including international currency
effects, which hurt results.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price (Nasdaq: TROW) said
first-quarter net income was $0.38 per share, down significantly
from last year's $0.58 and missing Wall Street's consensus
forecast by two pennies. Revenues fell to $280.5 million from
$316.3 million a year ago as declining assets under management
cut into the fees the company could collect. For more on mutual
funds, check out our recent special by Chris Rugaber.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396293

Internet security solutions company Entrust (Nasdaq: ENTU) named
former Nortel (NYSE: NT) executive William Conner its president
and CEO. A member of Entrust's board since 1997, Conner was
chairman from October 1998 to May 2000.

Oil company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) said first-quarter net
income, before items, was more than $5 billion at $1.44 per
share, up from last year's $0.95. Wall Street's consensus
estimate was $1.35 per share, but the company beat that handily
because of high oil and gas prices. Revenue was $57.3 billion.

Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN), profiled in a December
feature by Zeke Ashton, said Q1 net income was $0.41 per share,
up from last year's $0.24 and a penny better than estimates as
sales improved 27% to $429 million.

BIOGEN BEATS THE STREET
Biogen, the company known for the multiple sclerosis drug
Avonex, announced estimate-beating third-quarter results
yesterday after the bell.

By LouAnn Lofton

Biotech company Biogen (Nasdaq: BGEN) reported its third-quarter
(ended September 30) results yesterday after the bell. The
company's revenues climbed by 12% to $233.7 million. Net income
for the quarter was $68.3 million, or 10% higher than the $62
million Biogen earned in the year-ago period.

Earnings per share came in ahead of estimates by a penny at
$0.44. The consensus First Call/Thompson Financial estimate for
the company was $0.43. In its third quarter last year, Biogen
earned $0.39 a share.

Biogen's main revenue driver is Avonex, a drug used in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis. For its third quarter, sales of
Avonex rose 18% to $193 million. In fiscal 1999, Avonex sales
accounted for 78% of Biogen's revenues. The company said that
more than 93,000 patients worldwide are now using the drug. It
did acknowledge in a conference call, though, that the U.S.
market for Avonex is slowing.

Avonex also faces increased overseas competition in the multiple
sclerosis drug market. Here in the U.S., Avonex is protected
from competition until 2003. Biogen is working to develop
additional drugs (which it hopes will turn into additional
sources of revenue) through projects such as collaborations with
Irish drug company Elan (NYSE: ELN). The company also recently
licensed five new drug targets from CuraGen (Nasdaq: CRGN).

Biogen's president and chief executive officer, James C. Mullen,
said, "We continue with aggressive development of our pipeline
products. During the past quarter, we intensified our investment
in the important new platform technology of genomics and
expanded our long-term pipeline capabilities and basic research
programs with several collaborative agreements."

opportunities in biotechnology, consider signing up for The
Motley Fool's five-week, 15-lesson Biotechnology Investing
Online Seminar. Registration ends today!

NEWS TO GO

Hard driver manufacturer Seagate Technology (NYSE: SEG)
announced its fiscal 2001 first-quarter earnings yesterday after
the close. Pro forma net income for the quarter was $62 million
on revenue of $1.748 billion. Pro forma diluted earnings per
share came in at $0.26, which bested the Street's expectations
by a nickel.

PacifiCare Health Systems (Nasdaq: PHSY), a provider of managed
healthcare, told the Street yesterday that it sees its
third-quarter results coming in significantly below
expectations. The company expects earnings per share for the
third quarter to come in between breakeven and a loss of as much
as $0.10 a share. Analysts were looking for PacifiCare to report
third-quarter earnings per share of $1.90, according to First
Call/Thompson Financial. The company blamed higher-than-expected
medical costs for its shortfall.

The on-again, off-again talks between online delivery service
companies Urbanfetch.com and Kozmo.com are off again.
Urbanfetch.com said yesterday that it's halted negotiations to
be acquired by competitor Kozmo.com. Ross Stevens, the chief
executive of Urbanfetch.com, said, "We just didn't think Kozmo
had a profitable model, and we didn't think that Urbanfetch
Express would get the attention it needed."

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) says that an analysis of accidents
involving its Explorer sport utility vehicles was flawed,
according to The Washington Post. The analysis, which was
carried out by the Post and reported in Monday's edition of the
paper, found that Explorers have higher rates of tire-related
crashes even when the trucks are equipped with non-recalled
Goodyear tires. The analysis was carried out by looking at which
plants produced the Explorers, and what type of tire came on the
trucks from that particular plant. According to Ford, the plants
the company originally thought were putting just Goodyear tires
on Explorers were actually putting Firestone tires on about 4%
of the vehicles. Ford's vice president of communications, Jason
Vines, was quoted as saying that this new information
"repudiates the premise of the analysis."

VERIZON: LONG-DISTANCE BUSINESS RISIN'
Telecommunications services giant Verizon (NYSE: VZ) said
first-quarter profits from operations were $0.72 per share, up
from $0.69 a year ago. The company, formed when Bell Atlantic
bought GTE last summer, turned in revenues of $16.3 billion for
the quarter. The EPS figure was a penny better than the
consensus expectation of Wall Street analysts.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Shrewd cost-cutting at Disney (NYSE: DIS) helped the company
turned in fiscal second-quarter profit growth even as the top
line took a dip. Revenues fell to $6 billion from $6.3 billion.
Analysts were expecting an uptick to $6.4 billion. However,
higher margins propped operating profits to $0.19 a share, well
ahead of analyst estimates and last year's $0.14-a-share
showing. Look for more coverage of Disney in Fool News &
Commentary later today.

Contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics (Nasdaq: FLEX)
said fiscal Q4 EPS was $0.22, up from last year's $0.17 but down
$0.02 from Wall Street's projections. The company is cutting
about 7,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, and trimming
production capacity 15% in the face of slowing demand.

Mainframe software company BMC Software (NYSE: BMC) said it
earned $0.26 per share in fiscal Q4, beating the Street's $0.24
consensus estimate and its own preannounced $0.23 to $0.25 range
as revenues fell year-over-year to $422.8 million. The company
pointed investors toward full fiscal-year sales growth of
between 12% and 15%.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=397707

Pay-for-performance Web search service GoTo.com (Nasdaq: GOTO)
announced first-quarter losses of $0.13 per share, better than
the year-ago $0.20 per-share loss and well ahead of the $0.31 to
$0.33 range Wall Street was looking for. Revenues jumped more
than 200% to $50 million for the quarter.

"Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding in which you put your money in
your pants pocket and give your coat to your creditors." -- Joey
Adams


BASSETT HOUNDS
The furniture specialist barks -- and it bites.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

Bad news is like sandpaper -- it can wear you down until you're
dull and finished. Bassett Furniture (Nasdaq: BSET) becomes the
latest home furnishings specialist to send out pink slips and
warn of reupholstered financials. Earlier this month,
Furniture.com discontinued operations.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=214564

However, unlike Furniture.com's inability to secure financing to
subsidize losses, Bassett remains profitable despite trying
times in the furniture industry. Higher oil prices make shipping
bulky pieces as costly as it is cumbersome. Even worse, rising
interest rates have slowed the housing market to a crawl.
Without new homes to stock up with new furniture, the industry
becomes as attractive as that hideous barcolounger collecting
dust in your attic. The soft demand now finds Bassett expecting
fourth-quarter earnings per share to come in as much as a dime
below the $0.42 consensus estimate.

To offset the cyclical weakness, the company also announced a
consolidation of its domestic wood manufacturing operations.
Ultimately, 280 workers will be displaced. However, the wood
chuck won't disrupt the company's modest growth plans. The
company is still on track to open 52-65 new Bassett Furniture
Direct and At Home retail stores a year over the long term.

Bassett also won't reduce its dividend. That's welcome news to
yield investors who are drawn to the $0.20 quarterly dividend.
The company's hefty payout -- a 6.8% yield based on yesterday's
close -- will keep the stock from falling too far down.

Selling at just 8-9 times this year's freshly revised earnings
and with savings looking to beef up the bottom line in years
ahead, maybe Bassett isn't howling at the moon. Lowering costs
in domestic production in the face of cheaper Asian imports is a
painful yet necessary step. Like the company itself, the move
will pay nice dividends when housewarming gifts once again line
the porches of suburbia.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

High fiber? Communications infrastructure heavyweight Dycom
(NYSE: DY) reported better-than-expected earnings on a 46% spurt
in profits. The $0.51-a-share showing was seven cents ahead of
analyst estimates. Total contract revenue climbed by 32% for the
quarter. Dycom also named President and CEO Steven Nielsen as
its Chairman, succeeding the retired Thomas Pledger. Nielsen
will wear all three hats. He will also preside over the
company's acquisition of privately held Point to Point
Communications.

Is it Kevorkian or Kerkorian? Billionaire investor Kirk
Kerkorian, DaimlerChrysler's (NYSE: DCX) fifth-largest
shareholder, is suing the car maker for $9 billion. Kerkorian is
all revved up over his claim that the 1998 merger between
Daimler Benz and Chrysler was sold to him as a marriage of
equals. In his view, the European Mercedes Benz parent is
clearly in the driver's seat now. He'd rather play shotgun than
ride shotgun. According to Kerkorian, it was deception that
caused him to submit his 14% stake in Chrysler in favor of the
union.

The good, the bad, and the Covad (Nasdaq: COVD). The struggling
DSL provider has announced layoffs and will be scaling back its
marketing and network expansion costs. The expense reductions
should amount to 20-30% in annual savings beyond the onetime
charge, but that alone won't vault the company to profitability.
Many of the high-speed connection purveyors have had to temper
their expectations in recent months. Earlier, Covad had to
restate third-quarter results when it was having trouble
collecting from deadbeat cash-strapped ISP customers.

Like country, like company. Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) and AT&T
(NYSE: T) have announced new presidents. There were no dimpled
chads in the board room.

H & R Block (NYSE: HRB) ahead? Pall (NYSE: PLL) bearer? Is ADC
Telecommunications (Nasdaq: ADCT) OK? These are just some of the
questions the market will answer when the companies report
quarterly results today.

Bookseller Borders Group (NYSE: BGP) said fiscal first-quarter
(ended April 29) earnings, before charges, were $0.01 per share

to buy privately held Merlin Systems, a company developing
optical equipment for metro networking. The deal is expected to
close in Q3.

Interactive television company TiVo (Nasdaq: TIVO) said
yesterday that fiscal Q1 subscribers topped the 200,000 mark as
revenues jumped sixfold and losses doubled to $1.20 a share,
three cents better than analysts had projected. The company also
earned patents for recording during playback, streaming, and the
ability to pause and scan through live television. Look for
further coverage of TiVo in Fool News & Commentary later today.

COMVERSE NETWORKS A GOOD QUARTER
Comverse Technology reported estimate-beating third-quarter
results after the bell yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Comverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT) reported third-quarter
earnings yesterday after the bell. The company, which makes
systems and software for telecommunications, had an increase in
revenues of 37% and net income growth of 52% when compared to
the third quarter last year.

Comverse's sales improved to $317.97 million versus $232.89
million in the year-ago period. Comverse earned $68.41 million,
excluding one-time charges for acquisitions, up from last year's
$44.96 million. The company beat the consensus estimate
according to First Call by two cents with earnings per share of
$0.38. Comverse had earnings per share in last year's third
quarter of $0.28.

In the third quarter, Comverse acquired Exalink and Gaya
Software. The company took an after-tax charge of $4 million for
costs related to the purchases of those businesses.

Comverse improved gross margins to 62.6% from 61.4% in last
year's third quarter. The company also increased its net margins
from 19.3% to 21.5%.

Driving the results for Comverse was strong demand for the
company's products from wireless providers. A majority of
Comverse's sales are to wireless network operators.


AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

WORMS IN APPLE'S HOLIDAY QUARTER
By John Del Vecchio and Dave Marino-Nachison
With Gateway warning of a poor start to the holiday season less
than a week ago, there was definitely reason to figure that
Apple wouldn't be far behind in warning about near-term profits.
But in its most-recent quarter, Apple was the victim of its own
poor execution. How low can this cash-rich company's shares go?

GREENSPAN SPEAKS, STOCKS ROCKET
By Bill Mann
In a New York speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
said he is convinced that the torrid pace of economic growth
fueled by access to easy money has slowed. Greenspan remarked on
the fact that technology advancements have given the country
nearly unprecedented ability to gain efficiency -- but many
players in the high-tech market got to the game too late. Should
the economy slow too much, the Fed may just drop rates next
year. For now, though, the tightening bias is a thing of the
past. FULL STORY>>

NEWS TO GO

Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and 3M (NYSE: MM) have new chiefs and
they're both from General Electric (NYSE: GE). Home Depot named
Robert L. Nardelli its new president and CEO effective
immediately. 3M picked W. James McNerney Jr. as the company's
new chairman and CEO. Nardelli had been president and CEO of GE
Power Systems, and McNerney was head of GE Aircraft Engines.
Both men were being considered as replacements for GE's chairman
Jack Welsh, but were passed over in favor of fellow GE-er
Jeffrey Immelt.

Car parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported a drop in
first-quarter earnings yesterday. The company's net income was
$53.8 million, down from last year's $56 million. Sales grew 6%
to $1.06 billion. Buoyed by share repurchases, AutoZone
increased earnings per share to $0.46 from the year-ago period's
$0.40. The company blamed the net income shortfall on "a
difficult sales environment."

Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) said this morning that it
expects fourth-quarter earnings to increase by at least 55% over
last year's Q4 results. The company also thinks revenues will
grow to $12 billion in 2001. CEO Michael Ruettgers said in an
interview with Reuters that his company is "very comfortable"
with the current 2001 revenue projections, which are almost
double the company's 1999 levels.

Lante Group (Nasdaq: LNTE), an Internet consulting business, is
cutting its staff by 19%. This translates to about 120 jobs, and
the closure of the company's Singapore and Delhi offices. After
the cut-backs, Lante will have around 500 employees. Lante hopes
to save around $4 million with the reductions, starting in the
first quarter of 2001. The company is trying to become "cash
break-even" during the first half of 2001. Lante's president and
CEO, Rudy Puryear, said, "We did not react as quickly as we
should have to the speed and magnitude of this dramatically
changing environment. As a result, we are disappointed with our
recent financial results. Moreover, the decision to reduce our
workforce was very difficult, but necessary. We are implementing
several steps to reposition the business to grow revenue and
achieve profitability in the coming year."

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

IS DELL'S PRICE CUTTING WORKING?
PC maker Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) yesterday lowered guidance and
reported fiscal first-quarter (ended May 4) earnings in-line
with Wall Street's expectations. The company's aggressive
pricing continues to yield additional market share, but it's
also hurting earnings growth.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411717

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Handheld device maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) expects fourth-quarter
sales of $140 million to $160 million, compared to earlier
guidance of $300 million to $315 million. That lowered outlook
means it will post a loss of $170 million to $190 million,
versus earlier guidance for earnings of $80 million to $85
million. Palm is also taking a $300 million inventory charge and
canceling its merger with Extended Systems (Nasdaq: XTND) due to
market conditions. The Fool covered the handheld market this
week in an article entitled "Game Over for Palm and Handspring?"
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411718

Test and measurement equipment maker Agilent Technologies (NYSE:
A) posted lower-than-expected second-quarter profits yesterday,
citing slowing customer demand and a number of large order
cancellations. The company reported earnings of $0.26 per share,
a penny below Wall Street's consensus expectation. Agilent's
sales were $2.7 billion, compared to $2.5 billion in the
year-ago period. Next quarter, it expects a loss of $0.20 to
$0.30 per share, well below Wall Street's earlier estimate for
earnings of $0.25 per share.

Embedded software vendor Wind River Systems (Nasdaq: WIND) beat
lowered first-quarter estimates yesterday, but said sales would
fall 10% next quarter. The company posted earnings of $0.06 per
share, compared to $0.11 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue came in at $110.2 million. Next quarter, the company
expects sales of $96 million to $99 million and earnings of
$0.01 to $0.03 per share. Wind River is also cutting its
workforce by 12% to 15%. The Fool covered the company's warning
earlier this month.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=411719

Clothing retailer Gap (NYSE: GPS) said its first-quarter
earnings were in-line with Wall Street's expectations. Earnings
fell 2% year-over-year to $0.13 per share. Revenues increased
16% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, but same-store sales, which
measure sales growth at stores that have been open for more than
a year, fell 7%. Gap failed to give any guidance, instead
reiterating earlier comments that same-store sales will fall in
the second quarter. Two Fools Dueled over the future of the
retailer earlier this month.

CISCO: SUMMERTIME BOTTOM?
Some market watchers are calling the bottom for the business
performance of networking equipment maker Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:
CSCO). However,&nbsp;the company didn't provide much in the way
of new forward guidance after turning in fiscal third-quarter
results after last night's market close.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=405805

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) matched General Dynamics' (NYSE:
GD) bid for Newport News Shipbuilding (NYSE: NNS), the nation's
leading maker of nuclear submarines. Although General's offer
was in all cash and Northrop's was 75% cash and 25% stock, they
are for essentially the same amount. Northrop claims its offer
poses a better chance of getting past U.S. regulators.

News reports have Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) buying a 2.9% stake,
valued at $1.11 billion, in Italy's Assicurazioni Generali,
Europe's fourth-largest insurance company.

Tony women's apparel retailer Chico's FAS (NYSE: CHS) turned in
April sales that rose a remarkable 68.5% to $32.1 million.
Same-store sales for company-owned outlets improved 32.5%.
Fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) sales jumped 64.4% as "comps" ran ahead
27.7%. "Our increased marketing efforts and new television ads
in concert with great product and excellent customer service
continue to drive strong sales increases," said CEO Marvin
Gralnick.

Leading video game manufacturer Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS)
will make games for Nintendo's unreleased GameCube, the Japanese
company's bid to reclaim its once-dominant position in the
console business. GameCube will compete with Sony's (NYSE: SNE)
PlayStation 2 and the on-the-way Xbox from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT).

Researchers from voice-user-interface company Sound Advantage
and Lucent's (NYSE: LU) Bell Labs will team to develop a speech
recognition engine for Sound Advantage's messaging systems.
Lucent will receive warrants to purchase Sound Advantage stock
under the terms of the deal.

Food distribution company Fleming (NYSE: FLM) said fiscal Q1
(ended April 21) EPS was $0.41, up from $0.30 last year as
cost-cutting measures helped the firm overcome a 4% drop in
sales to $4.16 billion.

LIFTOFF AT EXPEDIA
Expedia tops estimates. Is the flight plan due north?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

Online travel specialist Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) has been cleared
for takeoff this morning after stellar fiscal first-quarter
results. Revenues soared 115% to $76.5 million on $467 million
in gross travel bookings.

Even more impressive was the fact that the company generated
positive operating cash flow. That may not last in the near term
as the company expects to ramp up marketing efforts that will
bulk up operating expenses. However, Expedia is still on track
to be profitable on an earnings basis by the summer of 2002.

The quarterly loss absent noncash charges was just $1.6 million,
or $0.04 a share. That was substantially better than
projections, which were calling for a deficit between $0.25 and
$0.27 a share.

The analyst-besting results continue the e-travel trend set by
Travelocity.com (Nasdaq: TVLY) two weeks ago. But probably the
most encouraging metric for the online travel industry as a
whole -- a gauge that seems to be buried deep in the data -- is
the rising conversion rate, or what Travelocity calls the
"lookers-to-bookers" ratio.

On a sequential basis, Expedia's conversion rate climbed from
4.1% to 4.6%. Over the past year, Travelocity users have gone
from a 3.8% conversion ratio to a stunning 6.8%.

Why is this so important? It vindicates the industry. While
jaded cybersurfers seem less willing to click on banner ads or
fall for spam, they have clearly embraced the notion of booking
travel online in growing numbers. Since e-travel is fully
scalable and information-intensive (not inventory
warehouse-based) the incremental growth is the best way to
assure a smooth flight to eventual profitability.

Expedia closed out the quarter with $122.3 million in cash. Half
of that came from recent financing that included the deep
pockets of Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), which still owns 70% of the
company after a November 1999 spin-off. The greenbacks? Well,
that just makes for a bigger seat cushion for the company as it
glides past the next few quarters. And you know what they say
about airline seat cushions, don't you? In case of emergency,
they can be used as a flotation device.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Santa Claus isn't the only one decked out in red this time of
year. Leading playthings online retailer eToys (Nasdaq: ETYS)
reported wider losses for the September quarter. However, the
company expects the deficit to narrow for the critical December
period with improving results next year en route to breaking
even come 2002. Like Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) last week, eToys
will be mailing out a print catalog this season to lure holiday
shoppers online.

All's well that's Alcatel (NYSE: ALA). Europe's second-leading
telecommunications equipment maker bucked the trend set earlier
by companies such as Lucent (NYSE: LU) and Nortel (NYSE: NT) and
reported stronger-than-projected results. Profits more than
tripled as the French company upgraded its sales outlook for the
year.

Are HMO stocks feeling better? Quarterly profits rose at Humana
(NYSE: HUM) while analysts expected bottom-line results to be in
line with last year's showing. The company credits its tighter
cost controls and the flexibility to raise premiums as the
catalysts for the healthy showing.

HEALTHSOUTH (NYSE: HRC) also came in for its quarterly checkup
and reported record revenues and profits of $0.18 a share -- in
line with analyst expectations. Like Humana, HEALTHSOUTH was
also encouraged by favorable pricing trends. Hey! That means
we're paying more for HMO service, doesn't it? I thought so.
Stay healthy and avoid eating any unwrapped candy tonight.

CITIGROUP GOES SOUTH FOR $12.5 BILLION
Citigroup (NYSE: C) will buy Mexico's No. 1 financial services
entity, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival ("Banacci"), for $12.5
billion -- half in cash and half in Citigroup stock, based on
the May 11 closing price of $49.26.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you lower expectations enough... Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP)
reported Q2 EPS of $0.16, against $0.45 last year, but beating
Street expectations of $0.15. The company began the quarter with
an estimate of $0.40 per share, which it reduced to $0.35 in
mid-April around the time it announced it would reduce
management by 3,000 out of 14,000. The company said Q3 EPS
estimates of $0.23 were reasonable. President and CEO Carly
Fiorina reportedly said on a conference call with analysts,
"While we don't see it getting a lot worse, we don't see it
getting substantially better in the near term.''

Ciena not burnt. Fiber optic systems vendor Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN)
continued to avoid the telecom slowdown and reported Q2 EPS of
$0.20 -- excluding acquisition charges and payroll taxes for
stock options -- more than three times the company's year-ago
showing of $0.06 a share and beating analysts' consensus
forecast by $0.04 a share. Ciena has maintained that its
business is relatively unaffected by telecom customer spending
woes because it makes new, advanced systems, not equipment for
legacy systems. Ciena also promoted Chief Operating Officer Gary
Smith to Chief Executive, moving current Chairman and CEO
Patrick Nettles to the position of executive chairman. Jeff
Fischer wrote yesterday about the insidious practice of
trumpeting numbers that exclude some kinds of onetime charges.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=410955

M'm! M'm!... OK? Drip Portfolio holding Campbell Soup (NYSE:
CPB) posted Q3 EPS of $0.30, meeting Street expectations, but
down $0.02 a share from last year. Net sales increased from
$1.39 billion to $1.44 billion, but advertising expenses jumped
50% and total marketing expenses 10%. The company expects Q4
earnings to be reduced by $0.03 a share due to the restructuring
of Arnott's, Campbell's Australian biscuit operation, and $0.02
to $0.03 a share due to the integration of Unilever's soup and
sauce business.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=410956

Bluelight district. Discount retailer Kmart (NYSE: KM) reported
a Q1 loss of $0.05 a share, against a $0.06-a-share profit a
year ago, despite a 1.7% increase in total sales. The company
said it was spending more on new computer systems and customer
service. Yet its stock is the No. 3 winner in the S&P 500 this
year, up 91%.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ALCATEL JOINS TELECOM SLUMP
Telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel (NYSE: ALA) reported
sharply lower Q1 net income, despite rising sales. The company's
Q1 EPS dropped to $0.18 from $0.26 a year ago, though sales
increased 21%, beating Street estimates of 17% growth. Alcatel
expects a 5% to 15% sales increase this year.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=398558

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Got the Benz? DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) reported a $545.7
million Q1 operating loss, against a $2.19 billion profit a year
ago. While the loss was a quarter to a third less than
projected, it was hardly cause for investor rejoicing. The
company was weighed down strongly by Freightliner, its sagging
U.S. heavy truck unit, which faces a 50% decline in the North
American market. During the quarter, the company took a $2.78
billion charge for restructuring Chrysler and 37.3%-owned
Mitsubishi, and implemented a plan to cut Chrysler jobs 20%, or
26,000, over three years. Yet despite belt-tightening, the
company's marketing expenses as a percent of revenue ballooned
from 13.3% last year and 18.3% last quarter to 21.1%, against
Ford Motor's (NYSE: F) 12.2%.

Look out, Warren Buffett! United Airlines parent UAL Corp.
(NYSE: UAL) plans to offer within five years a fractional-jet
ownership service with 200 planes seating six to 14 people. The
current market leader is Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)
Executive Jet unit, now running full-page glossy ads with a
smiling Buffett enjoying his flight in a plane's commodious
interior. Executive Jet sports 265 planes and reportedly plans
to add 55 to 70 annually over the next five years. CEO Richard
Santulli said he welcomes the competition, and jabbed, "[United]
won't have that luxury of putting up a 'cancelled' sign for a
flight with corporate jets."

Feet on the gas. Rising natural gas prices made profits, uh,
gush at Chevron (NYSE: CHV), Amerada Hess (NYSE: AHC), Unocal
(NYSE: UCL), and Kerr-McGee (NYSE: KMG). For the quarter ended
March 31, the companies' earnings per share jumped 57%, 115%,
53%, and 65%, respectively, over the year-ago period, stomping
Street estimates all around.

Home sweet home. The U.S. Commerce Department announced that
March new home sales spiked 4.2% for a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.02 million units, with used home sales up 4.8%
to a 5.44 million annual pace, just below June 1999's record
5.45 million rate. The median price for an existing home bumped
up 6.5% from a year ago to $143,500, while the average price for
an existing home increased 4.7% to $179,600. Historically low
unemployment and declining mortgage rates are likely causes.

HUMAN GENOME'S Q3
Biotech company Human Genome Sciences announced a cash-rich Q3
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Rule Breaking biotechnology company Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq: HGSI) reported third-quarter (ended September 30)
earnings yesterday after the market's close. Revenues climbed
for the drug development company, while losses widened.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=185959

Human Genome's third-quarter revenues increased to $8.1 million,
compared to $7.4 million in last year's third quarter. Included
in this amount is a licensing fee the company received from
MedImmune (Nadaq: MEDI), related to a SmithKline Beecham (NYSE:
SBH) vaccine development deal.

The company lost $147 million in the quarter, including a
onetime write-off related to the $134.1 million acquisition of
Principia Pharmaceutical. Excluding this charge, Human Genome
lost $13 million, or $0.12 a share. In the year-ago period, it
lost $9.7 million, or $0.11 per share. Analysts as polled by
First Call/Thompson Financial had expected Human Genome to lose
$0.13 a share, excluding charges, so the company beat that by a
penny.

Human Genome Sciences had $849.5 million in cash and short-term
investments as of the close of the quarter. This compares to the
$466.2 million it had in cash and short-term investments at the
end of December 1999.

After the end of the third quarter, the company sold more stock
to the public and raised an additional $950 million in cash.
Counting that amount, Human Genome's current amount of cash and
short-term investments is about $1.8 billion. The company now
has about 124.8 million shares of outstanding common stock,
compared to 112.1 million at the close of the third quarter.

William A. Haseltine, Human Genome's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement, "We are pleased that our
recent efforts have brought several HGS drugs closer to the
patients who need them. At the same time, we focused on enabling
scientists at HGS and our partners to discover and develop
additional drugs that may aid more patients to lead healthier,
more active lives."

NEWS TO GO

Online auction house eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is cutting some of its
offline workers. About 15% of the employees at the eBay-owned
Butterfields fine-art auction company will be losing their jobs.
That equals about 32 people. eBay cut 13 jobs at the Chicago
Butterfields office back in July. eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove
said, "The management team at Butterfields came to the
conclusion that they will continue to move the business to the
online area."

Good-bye, MotherNature.com (Nasdaq: MTHR). Just after we lost
Pets.com (Nasdaq: IPET) and that annoyingly cute little sock
puppet, MotherNature.com announced that it, too, is shutting its
doors. MotherNature.com is the second venture backed by CMGI
(Nasdaq: CMGI) to go belly-up this week. The other, online
furniture retailer Furniture.com, announced that it's closing on
Monday. MotherNature.com spent time looking for a buyer for its
online vitamins and health products business, but could find no
takers. The company's board of directors approved a plan to
liquidate and dissolve the company on Tuesday.

Preppy-chic designer and retailer Polo Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL)
announced second-quarter results this morning. The company's
sales grew by 8% to $586.2 million, compared to $543.9 million
last year. Net income, before restructuring and other special
charges, was $48.8 million, versus $55.3 million in the year-ago
period. Earnings per diluted share on this basis were $0.50,
down from last year's $0.56. The company said the reduction in
net income and earnings per share was expected because of a
delay in recognizing some European sales results, as well as a
shift with the timing of some of its shipments.

AOL Latin America (Nasdaq: AOLA) reported first-quarter results
yesterday. The Internet services provider, which is a joint
venture between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and the Cisneros
Group of Companies, lost $0.36 a share, or $98.1 million.
Analysts had expected a loss of $0.37 a share. Revenues in the
quarter were $4.6 million. AOL Latin America said it added
191,000 users in the quarter, bringing its total number of
members to 314,000.

NVIDIA KEEPS CHIPPIN'
Nvidia has overtaken ATI Technologies as the largest maker of
graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers.

By Mike Trigg

Computer graphic chip maker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) reported
better-than-expected third-quarter results after the market's
close yesterday, citing market share gains attributable to
original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) and system builders'
rapid adoption of its GPU technologies. The company maintained a
robust growth outlook, expanding out of its core desktop
business.

Nvidia's fiscal third-quarter (ended October 31) net income was
$28.1 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $10.6 million, or
$0.15 per share, in the comparable period a year ago. The Street
consensus estimate called for the company to earn $0.32 per
share. Moreover, revenues came in at $198.2 million, more than
doubling year-over-year from $97 million. And operating income
grew 142% to $36.6 million.

According to a new study this week by Mercury Research, Nvidia
has overtaken ATI Technologies (Nasdaq: ATYT) as the largest
maker of graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers. For the
third quarter, Nvidia chips were in 48% of all desktop
computers, increasing more than twofold from a year ago.

Meanwhile, ATI's desktop market share slipped five percentage
points to 34%. However, in the laptop market, ATI expanded its
market share from 29% in the same period a year ago to 57%,
highlighted by new contracts with IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell
(Nasdaq: DELL). Despite losing money in the last two quarters,
ATI expects to re-enter the black in the current quarter (ends
November 30). Nevertheless, Nvidia's gains continue to look
impressive in comparison to the competition.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia has made significant gains
winning over longtime ATI customers, including Compaq Computer
(NYSE: CPQ) and Gateway (NYSE: GTW). According to the Street,
the shift has occurred because Nvidia has been more successful
at rolling out improved chips every six months. In a press
release yesterday, CEO and President Jen-Hsun Huang cited its
newest GeForce chip, the GeForce2 Ultra, as cause for its
expanding leadership position.

The other competitive force, 3Dfx Interactive (Nasdaq: TDFX), is
coming off a disappointing July quarter when revenue was less
than half of what the Street expected. The company attributed
the shortfall to component shortages and "competitive and retail
seasonality factors." Similarly, the company announced it would
report disappointing results for the quarter ending in October.

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

DELL ANNOUNCES Q3

Direct PC seller Dell announced third-quarter results after the
market's close today, in line with the consensus Street
expectation. With speculation throughout the day looming that
Dell had "juiced" revenue numbers at quarter's end, shares
traded down roughly 6% to close at $28.38. The company also
reconfirmed earlier guidance that called for sales to rise 27%
year-over-year, slightly below the 30% growth the company was
expecting earlier in the year.

NEWS TO GO

Guess what? Sexy jeans retailer Guess (NYSE: GES) announced
third-quarter profits after the market's close well below Street
expectations, citing excess inventory and a difficult retail
environment. Guess reported third-quarter profits of $5.6
million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.33
per share, in the year-ago period. That's well below the Street
consensus expecting $0.36 per share. Inventory levels at
quarter's end were $164.2 million, up from $94.2 million last
year. Total revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $216.4
million. Guess also revised its fourth-quarter outlook, now
calling for earnings to be $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share.
The Street estimate called for $0.36 per share.

Construction and industrial supplies distributor Hughes Supply
(NYSE: HUG) reported that it would miss third-quarter and
full-year estimates. The company expects earnings between $0.75
per share and $0.79 per share, down from $0.87 per share in the
same period last year. The consensus Street estimate had called
for $0.93 per share. Sales for the quarter should come in at
$860 million, about 10% lower than expected. The company expects
full-year sales growth of 9% to 11%, and full-year earnings
between $2.75 per share and $2.80 per share. The
slower-than-expected growth was attributed to commodity pricing
exposure for many plumbing and building materials products.

You learn real good! Computer training company Learning Tree
International (Nasdaq: LTRE) posted solid fourth-quarter and
full-year results after the market's close yesterday. Learning
Tree reported earnings of $9.1 million, or $0.40 per share,
compared to $5.7 million, or $0.26 per share, one year ago.
That's well ahead of the Street consensus of $0.36 per share.
Moreover, the Orlando, Florida-based company pulled in $56
million in sales, increasing 21% from $48.5 million in the same
period last year. For the entire fiscal year, Learning Tree
earned $50.4 million, or $1.65 per share, compared to $14.7
million, or $0.57 per share, last year.

Managed healthcare service provider PacifiCare Health Systems
(Nasdaq: PHSY) reported a significant drop in third-quarter net
income, citing rising medical costs related to the company's
transition from capitated contracts to per-diem, fee-for-service
or shared-risk arrangements with hospitals. The Santa Ana,
Calif.-based company turned in earnings of $5.2 million, or
$0.15 per share, compared to $69.3 million, or $1.54 per share,
in the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for a
$0.07-per-share loss. Results reported for the quarter include a
$3.8 million credit, or $0.11 per share, related to the early
termination of a license agreement. Results for the same period
last year reflected a $1.7 million net charge, or a
$0.04-per-share loss, for impairment and disposition activities.
Revenue were $2.87 billion, increasing 14% from $2.52 billion.

COMMERCE ONE REPORTS Q3
Internet B2B company Commerce One posted solid Q3 results after
the market's close yesterday and now forecasts profitability by
the second quarter of next fiscal year.

By Mike Trigg

Internet marketplace software provider Commerce One (Nasdaq:
CMRC) reported impressive third-quarter results after the
market's close yesterday, highlighted by new customer additions
and the signing of several global mega-exchanges. The
announcement came one day after business-to-business (B2B)
juggernaut Ariba (Nasdaq: ARBA) declared its own results,
becoming the first B2B company to report a breakeven quarter.

Commerce One's fiscal third quarter (ended September 30) net
loss, excluding charges, was $14.7 million, or $0.09 per share,
compared to $10.3 million, or $0.07 per share, in the same
period one year ago. The Street consensus called for a loss of
$0.12 per share. The positive results prompted management to
revise its initial projection, now calling for profitability by
next year's fiscal second quarter (ends June 30).

However, revenue figures tell the real story because B2B
companies are still in a stage of hypergrowth. Commerce One's
revenues increased from $62.7 million in the previous period to
$112.7 million. That's 80% sequential growth. The revenue mix
was 58% licenses (65% last quarter), with services accounting
for the remaining 42% (35% last quarter). Nevertheless, as I
mentioned earlier this week, deferred revenues and the amount of
network revenues within service revenues were two important
factors to track. Let's take a look at those quickly.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162547

Commerce One reported network revenues of $10.1 million, a
sequential increase of $3 million. This number is important
because it represents the amount of revenue sharing that
occurred on active marketplaces and will substantially increase
as more exchanges go live. Moreover, it currently represents
mostly auction and subscription fees. However, as exchanges
mature, it will include a greater amount of value-added and
transaction-based revenue.

Deferred revenues took a jump from $62 million in the previous
period to $95 million. Deferred revenues are a good liability
because they represent cash that has been realized before at
least a portion of the services have been completed. It's an
important figure because it provides up-front investment capital
and signifies management isn't overstating business. This
quarter's increase can in part be attributed to the company's
partnership with SAP (NYSE: SAP); however, management would not
disclose to what amount.

The alliance with SAP continued to show major traction, despite
being just 90 days old. Through the joint partnership, the
company announced several mega-exchanges that include eHitex
(high tech), Enporion (utility), Quadrem (mining and metals),
and ForestExpress (paper and forest products). This gives the
company 60% market share for top vertical exchanges. To hear
Ariba CEO Keith Krach comment on the Commerce One and SAP
alliance, check out Paul Commins' recent Rule Breaker column.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=162548

Overall, the company posted a solid quarter and continued to
execute, growing its total of 72 marketplaces to 107. Meanwhile,
the number of live exchanges improved to 47, and the customer
count improved by 96 to 316. The quarter was particularly
impressive considering the acquisition of AppNet was only on the
books for two weeks, and significant contributions will be made
in the services portion of revenue upon a full quarter of
contribution.

NEWS TO GO

Fiber optic equipment maker Corvis Corp. (Nasdaq: CORV)
announced better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings
after the market's close yesterday. The company reported a pro
forma loss, excluding goodwill expense and equity-based pay, of
$23.9 million, or $0.07 per share. The Street consensus called
for a loss of $0.09 per share. Revenue came in at $22.9 million.
However, the company still relies heavily on Broadwing (NYSE:
BRW), which began commercial deployment of Corvis' suite of
optical products in the quarter. Corvis closed at $59.60 per
share in the regular session and jumped as high as $71 per share
in after-hours trading.

Internet auction company eBay Inc. (Nasdaq: EBAY) announced its
third-quarter earnings, exceeding Street expectations. The
company said its earnings, excluding charges, were $19.1
million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $3 million, or $0.01
per share, in the year-ago period. The Street consensus estimate
was $0.04 per share. Revenues improved year-over-year from $58.5
million to $113.4 million. In a conference call yesterday, eBay
management stated the positive results were due to increased
exposure in new geographic regions and additional product areas.
Also, it cited a shift toward higher-margin products, such as
cars.

Voice recognition software provider SpeechWorks (Nasdaq: SPWX)
reported third-quarter earnings after the market's close
yesterday, with revenues improving nearly threefold
year-over-year and earnings that exceeded Street expectations.
The Boston-based company reported a loss, excluding charges, of
$5.4 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to a pro forma loss
of $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period last
year. The Street consensus forecasted a loss of $0.23 per share.
The company reported revenue of $8.6 million, a 237%
year-over-year increase.

The world's largest maker of cellular phones, Ericsson (Nasdaq:
ERICY), reported fiscal third-quarter earnings this morning and
cut sales forecasts and profit figures for full-year 2000. The
company attributed the revised outlook to losses in its mobile
phone division and will now place a greater emphasis on wireless
network equipment. The Swedish company is losing valuable market
share to Finnish phone maker Nokia (NYSE: NOK), which yesterday
predicted profitability in the fourth quarter. It also announced
that it would move Swedish and U.S. phone production to Asia,
Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Stay tuned for more on this
story.

BROADVISION SAYS, "THANK YOU, PAINEWEBBER"
BroadVision lands on the S&P 500. Index fund managers set
phasers to &"Buy."

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

"Thank you, PaineWebber!"

That's the heartfelt gratitude coming from the BroadVision
(Nasdaq: BVSN) camp this morning after the e-commerce software
specialist was named the latest addition to the S&P 500.

The vacancy sign lit up after German financial titan UBS (NYSE:
UBS) agreed to acquire index member PaineWebber (NYSE: PWJ), the
fourth-largest domestic brokerage services company. The
transition will take place on Monday.

In a world where quality companies are acquired or fade away,
next week's index adjustment is hardly a rare event. Turnover
comes with the territory. There have been 178 company changes
within the S&P 500 over the pas five years, with no less than
two dozen switches in any given year during that time.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=157948

The process isn't that far removed from such events as getting
into a hot New York City nightspot during peak party hours or
landing Green Bay Packers season tickets. Someone has to bow out
first, by will or misconduct, and then the thorough selection
process begins. Making it to the end of the velvet rope or the
top of the waiting list is an honor. While BroadVision's shares
are nearly 75% off their March highs, the index inclusion
provides some sort of market validation.

Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, BroadVision's new role
may seem inconsequential. The stock will make up just 0.05% (or
1/2,000th) of the index's total market capitalization. But the
numbers add up in a hurry. With speculators trying to jump the
gun before the index-based vehicles adjust their portfolios, the
buy orders should be streaming in this week. For instance, the
$105 billion Vanguard 500 Index Fund alone will have to buy up
at least a $50 million stake in BroadVision come Monday.

So PaineWebber, whose mutual funds were ranked 100 out of 101
fund families by SmartMoney this year, finally found a way to
enrich investors -- BroadVision's shareholders.

NEWS TO GO

Earning disappointments are a disease and McAfee (Nasdaq: MCAF)
has the cure. The anti-virus software company reported a
narrower loss than expected (before non-cash charges) on an 86%
spike in revenues. Users have taken to safe computing as a
result of well-publicized viral outbreaks such as the "I Love
You" virus earlier this year. Traffic at the McAfee site has now
grown to 400,000 daily, and the company has lined up 650,000
paying subscribers. McAfee is majority-owned by Network
Associates (Nasdaq: NETA), which also announced
better-than-expected earnings.

>From a whisper number to a scream, shares of chip maker Altera
(Nasdaq: ALTR) should open lower this morning after the company
reported third-quarter results. While the $0.28-a-share showing
was in line with estimates, it came a penny shy of Wall Street's
whisper number. If no one wants to step in and pick up shares at
half the price they were fetching just last month, Altera will.
The company doubled its buyback plans from 24 million shares to
48 million. That means that as much as 9% of the outstanding
stock might be bought back in the open market.

Drive-in theaters might have become flea market stomping
grounds, but drive-in restaurants are motoring.
Burger-to-your-car chain Sonic (Nasdaq: SONC) closed out a

firm earned $1.41 the year before. Unit production remains
lettuce-crisp. Sonic has grown same-store sales for 14
consecutive years now.

Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) reported analyst-topping earnings
despite a slowdown in its investment banking division. Earnings
climbed by 52% to $0.94 a share -- eight pennies above projections.
With tensions running high given recent market volatility, the
company was able to grow commissions to 26% of quarterly revenues.
In boxing terms, this is a TKO.

Historians marvel at Galileo, and now Marvell Tech (Nasdaq:
MRVL) wants Galileo Tech (Nasdaq: GALT). In a $2.7 billion
proposed stock swap, Marvell will offer 0.674 of a share for
each share of the Israeli semiconductor company. Though the
original Galileo -- 17th century Italian philosopher and
astronomer Galileo Galilei -- was an independent thinker,
Galileo Tech will no longer be an independent company.

"It is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd
fashion." -- Anatole France


AGILENT EARNS ITS "A"
Agilent tops estimates and moves to the head of the class.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

If there were truth in ticker symbols, Agilent (NYSE: A) would
be holding up its "A" report card proudly. With quarterly
estimates pegged at $0.53 a share, the electronics testing
equipment maker powered up expectations with a $0.69-a-share showing.

That was a 77% surge in bottom-line growth before charges on
$3.4 billion in revenues for the September period. That's
welcome news for a company that has seen its shares fall sharply
since peaking at $162 back in March.

However, a slowdown in microchip testing equipment as well as
weakness in the wireless market has the company warning of
slower growth ahead. With a healthy backlog of orders, Agilent
still expects to meet estimates of $0.45 for the current
quarter.

Spun off by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) last year, Agilent will
be deploying new capital into areas where it sees higher growth:
communications and life sciences. I guess that gives the company
an "A" for effort too.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Chipped off the old block, semiconductor distributor Avnet
(NYSE: AVT) announced that earnings for the current quarter
would come in between a nickel to a dime below the $0.85-a-share
forecast. While acknowledging the cyclical ways of the chip
industry, the company believes that earnings for the rest of the
year will remain on track.

Attention holiday shoppers, Nieman Marcus (NYSE: NMG.A) reported
stronger-than-expected profits but warned of slow action at the
registers so far this month. That's critical as the upscale
department store chain heads into the important buying season.
Nobody wants to see the Grinch steal Christmas (well, OK, it did
top the box office this past weekend, but that's another story).

EDGAR Hoovered? The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)
site for electronic financial filing and data retrieval will go
down on Friday for a "major upgrade." The Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system -- thankfully better
known as EDGAR -- will be back up on Monday morning.

Has Ozzy Osbourne bitten off more than he can chew -- again? The
legendary showman is suing Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH) and
MCY.com (Nasdaq: MCYC) for broadcasting an Ozzfest 2000 concert
tour stop to Hughes' DirecTV subscribers. Osbourne claims that
tour sponsor MCY.com only had rights to a Web cast of the rock
event. Mr. Crowley will not be his legal counsel.

Deere (NYSE: DE) John? An epic Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL)? Hit the
Fluor (NYSE: FLR)? These questions and more will be answered as
the companies get set to release earnings today.

"Why not go out on a limb? That's where the fruit is."
--Mark Twain


PEPSI COURTING QUAKER, AGAIN
Quaker Oats and Pepsi are talking once more, but will the
outcome be the same?

By Mike Trigg

The Quaker Oats (NYSE: OAT) story took another spin yesterday,
when the world's second-largest soft drink company, PepsiCo
(NYSE: PEP), resumed talks to purchase the maker of Gatorade for
$14.3 billion. Not long ago, similar discussions were brought to
a halt after Quaker rejected Pepsi's offer, citing a dispute in
price.

The story with Quaker is an interesting one. After similar talks
with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and French food conglomerate Groupe
Danone (NSYE: DA) failed to materialize, investors are left to
ask: Is this time for real?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=3D223139

According to The Wall Street Journal, the two sides appear close
to agreement, with the deal potentially wrapping up in the next
couple of days. If the two sides in fact do reach agreement, an
announcement would be made Monday morning. Both companies have
planned board meetings for this Saturday.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D223140

Apparently, the proposed deal is no different than the last.
Quaker Oats shareholders would receive 2.3 shares of Pepsi
stock, valued at $104.36, based on Pepsi's closing price of
$43.38 yesterday. That's a 27% premium to Quaker Oats=01, stock
price as of November 2, the day original talks were made public.
Pepsi hasn't offered a "collar" -- the original deal breaker --
to Quaker, which is a form of price protection that fixes a
price within a set limit of how far the buyer's shares can rise
or fall. The same Wall Street Journal article reports that an
arrangement is being negotiated that would allow Quaker to
abandon the deal if the value provided to Quaker shareholders
became less than $90 per share upon closing.

If the deal does go through this time around Pepsi would surpass
Coca-Cola as the leader in the non-carbonated U.S drinks market,
holding nearly one-third of the market, compared to Coca-Cola's
21%. According to the Street, Pepsi would also be able to jump
start sales of Quaker Chewy Granola bars, selling them through
its Frito-Lay food division.

NEWS TO GO

Information transfer device maker Crossroads Systems (Nasdaq:
CRDS) announced better-than-expected third-quarter results after
the market's close yesterday, reporting a net loss (excluding
goodwill and stock compensation) of $4.8 million, or $0.18 per
share, compared to a loss of $870,000, or $0.04 per share, in
the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for the company
to lose $0.21 per share. Crossroads=01, top line came in at $8.4
million, an 18% increase year-over-year.

Discount airline company Cheap Tickets (Nasdaq: CTIX) announced
that CFO Dale Jorgensen plans on retiring in February. Jorgenson
will remain with the company after his retirement to aid in the
transition and provide assistance on certain projects. ``While
my time with Cheap Tickets has been very rewarding, I have
decided to devote more time to my family and other personal
interests. I am very pleased to have been part of the progress
the company has made moving into the public market and see a
great future for Cheap Tickets' unique multi-channel revenue and
distribution model,'' said Jorgensen.

Carbon dioxide seller Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP)
announced a deal with GATX Corp. (NYSE: GMT) to purchase two oil
product pipelines and 12 storage terminals for $1.15 billion in
cash and debt. Kinder Morgan Partners Chairman and CEO Richard
Kinder estimated the deal would increase earnings per share
between $1.62 and $1.75 in 2001, with the Street consensus
calling for the company to earn between $1.50 and $1.62 a share
in the coming year. The deal is expected to close in the first
quarter of next year.

Heating and cooling products provider Modine Manufacturing
(Nasdaq: MODI) announced that it was revising earnings and sales
forecasts for its third quarter and the full fiscal year (ends
March 31, 2001). The Racine, Wisconsin-based company expects
third-quarter revenue to be down 10% to 13% and earnings 55% to
65%. For the full year, sales should be down 7% to 10% with
earnings dropping between 25% and 30%. The company cited a weak
euro and lower sales in the heavy-truck and light-vehicle
markets. Modine earned $2.20 per share in the previous year.

Steel processing company Worthington Industries (NYSE: WOR)
announced that its second-quarter (ended yesterday) earnings
would fall short of expectations and that it had halted its
proposed $300 million acquisition of three Pennsylvania limited
partnerships: MetalTech, NexTech, and GalvTech. The company said
earnings would be substantially lower than the $0.15 per share
it posted in the previous quarter and that the full-year Street
earnings expectation of $1.07 was unrealistic. The Street
consensus called for the company to earn $0.22 per share in the
second quarter. The company cited the weakness in several of its
business, including its steel-processed products operations.

"The scalded cat fears even cold water." -- Thomas Fuller


MIXED NEWS FROM APPLIED MATERIALS
The company reports a strong fourth quarter, but warns that next
quarter's earnings will miss expectations.

By Chris Rugaber

Leading semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (Nasdaq:
AMAT) reported strong fourth-quarter results after the closing
bell yesterday, doubling profits on an 81% increase in sales.
However, the company also warned that fiscal first-quarter
earnings would miss current forecasts.

Nevertheless, the company's fourth quarter (ended October 29)
was solid, to say the least. Net income jumped to $663.8
million, or $0.77 per share, from $303.8 million, or $0.37 per
share, in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts expected the
company to earn $0.76 per share. Sales reached $2.92 billion, up
from $1.61 billion, while new orders more than doubled to $3.6
billion and backlog increased to $4.38 billion, from $3.69
billion last year. Margins also improved, with gross margin
increasing to 51.7%, up from 49.6% in the year-earlier period,
and net margin rising to 22.7%, 3.9 points higher than the
year-earlier figure.

Despite the strong showing, the company is cautious about future
results, which is not too surprising given the cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry. While Applied Materials benefited
from capacity increases at many chipmakers earlier this year,
concerns over slowing mobile phone and PC sales have muddied the
waters regarding revenue and earnings for the second half of
next year. "Conditions in our industry have become more complex
and uncertain," Chief Financial Officer Joseph Bronson told
Bloomberg News. "It is unclear what the impact of this
uncertainty will be on our markets."

For next quarter, the company stated that earnings per share
(EPS) were likely to come in between $0.75 and $0.78, below
current analysts' estimates of $0.80. Revenue should be between
$2.9 billion and $2.95 billion, below previous expectations of
$3.12 billion.

Investors that have held on through Applied Materials' ups and
downs have done pretty well over the years, though recent times
have been tougher. For more information about the company, check
out a Daily Double from Rick Munarriz this past spring.

NEWS TO GO

In a long-expected move, AT&T (NYSE: T) announced yesterday that
it would spin off cable TV programming division Liberty Media
(NYSE: LMG.A), which it received as part of its purchase of
cable giant Tele-Communications, Inc. last year. While the
decision is dependent on a favorable tax ruling, AT&T plans to
convert the company's tracking stock to an asset-based equity
and distribute shares to holders of the tracking stock in the
second quarter of 2001. By selling Liberty, which owns stakes in
the E! Entertainment Network and Courtroom Television Network,
AT&T may satisfy regulatory conditions placed on it for the
approval of its purchase of cable operator MediaOne Group.

The mega-merger between America Online (NYSE: AOL) and Time
Warner (NYSE: TWX) may be delayed past the two companies'
self-imposed deadline of December 21, according to a report in
today's Wall Street Journal. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
wants the two companies to strike a cable-access deal with an
Internet service provider (ISP) as a condition of the merger,
and last week the FTC delayed a vote on the merger until
November 30 to give the two companies time to strike a deal with
an ISP. Nevertheless, the FTC would have to approve a
cable-access deal before the merger vote, and may not be able to
do so in time. The Journal also reported that the two companies
disagreed on strategy, as Time Warner wanted last week's vote to
proceed, while AOL did not. An AOL vice president denied that
there were any disagreements.

Retailer Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) reported dismal third-quarter
earnings after yesterday's market close. The company, under new
management led by Nordstrom family members, saw profit from
operations drop 41% to $23.4 million, or $0.18 per share, from
$39.7 million, or $0.29 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales rose 13%, to $1.25 billion, from $1.11 billion. The
company used steep price markdowns to clear out summer and fall
merchandise, and also saw an increase in operating expenses,
with sales, general and administrative (SG&A) costs jumping to
34.8% of revenue from 31.7% a year earlier.

The world's second-largest auction house, Sotheby's (NYSE: BID),
reported a disappointing third quarter and warned that
fourth-quarter and fiscal 2000 earnings would be below last
year's. Third-quarter sales dropped 6%, from $45.3 million last
year to $42.6 million, and losses from operations increased to
$0.45 per share, from $0.41. In addition, the company took a
pre-tax charge of $184.8 million, or $2.68 per share, as a
result of its settlement of shareholder lawsuits and an
antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. The
company pleaded guilty last month to conspiring with its rival
Christie's on auction commission fees.

GATEWAY BUSTS OUT WITH STRONG Q3
The personal computer maker reported third-quarter earnings
after the close yesterday, reaffirming its beyond-the-box
strategy.

By Mike Trigg

Personal computer (PC) maker Gateway (NYSE: GTW) announced
earnings in line with Street expectations after the market's
close yesterday, citing strong consumer and small business sales
and continued growth in Europe. After warnings from stalwart
technology firms Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), and
Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) sent PC stocks tumbling in recent weeks,
the news was an affirmation of the company's beyond-the-box
business strategy.

Gateway reported fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net
income of $152.6 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $113.2
million, or $0.35 per share, one year ago. A quick look at
profits shows this was its third consecutive quarter of 30%-plus
net income growth.

On the revenue side, the San Diego, Ca. company reported sales
of $2.53 billion, an increase of 16% from $2.18 billion in the
same period a year ago. As a percentage of sales, gross margins
improved one percentage point from the year-ago period to 23.1%.
Here, we begin to see the effect of the company's strategy of
diversifying its product offering.

More than 50% of sales from the quarter came from hardware,
software, and services other than the PC. This exceeded company
expectations, which called for 45% by the end of the fourth
quarter. By gaining traction with its beyond-the-box strategy,
the company sets itself up for further margin expansion. Non-PC
products and services are high-margin businesses, thus allowing
a greater proportion of sales to trickle down to the bottom
line. CFO John Todd discussed this subject in the conference
call last night, noting the company sees a day when the majority
of revenues come from products and services outside the box.

Internationally, revenues in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa
increased 13%. The company indicated that, without currency
difficulties, top-line growth would have seen a 27%
year-over-year improvement. Moreover, Gateway's Asia Pacific arm
saw an 8% growth in revenue and was adversely affected by
problems with suppliers of disk drives, which have since been
solved.

This quarter was especially good for Gateway. Next quarter is
typically its strongest, and the company is comfortable with the
consensus estimate calling for 48% profit growth. The consumer
segment and software revenue related to the PC will continue to
drive growth in coming quarters

NEWS TO GO

Internet router provider Juniper Networks (Nasdaq: JNPR)
announced fiscal third-quarter net income of $58.2 million, or
$0.17 per share, compared to a loss of $1.6 million, or $0.01
per share, year-over-year. The Street consensus called for the
company to earn $0.09 per share. Revenue was $201.2 million, a
78% sequential increase. CEO Scott Kriens cited strong demand
among service providers to handle the increased amount of
Internet traffic. The company directly competes with Cisco
(Nasdaq: CSCO) and is gaining serious market traction in the
space, which apparently hasn't been affected by the technology
slowdown.

Data availability software provider Veritas (Nasdaq: VRTS)
reported better-than-expected earnings after the market's close
yesterday, citing continued international strength, steady
revenue, and market share growth in the Windows NT space, and
expansion of its Unix business. Veritas' fiscal third-quarter
net income excluding adjustments was $70.3 million, or $0.16 per
share, compared to $38.9 million, or $0.09 per share, a year
ago. The Street consensus called for the company to earn $0.14
per share. CFO Ken Lonchar added in a prepared release that the
company continues to see strong growth of its Hewlett-Packard
(NYSE: HWP) business.

Internet advertising company DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK)
announced third-quarter earnings after the close yesterday in
line with Street expectations. The company's net income totaled
$3.7 million, or $0.03 per share, versus a loss of $3.8 million,
or $0.03 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenues were $135.2
million, compared to $75.3 million. Specifically, the media unit
reported revenue of $64.3 million, an 86% increase. The number
of advertisers fell 10% from the prior quarter. Moreover, it
maintained a bearish outlook for the rest of the year, adding
that current conditions likely won't change till the second
quarter of next year.

Communications chip maker PMC-Sierra (Nasdaq: PMCS) reported
that fiscal third-quarter profits had tripled, citing strong
sales to makers of computer networking gear. The company also
forecasted that sales would rise 15% in the next period. Net
income excluding onetime items was $56 million, or $0.31 per
share, compared to $18.7 million, or $0.11 per share,
year-over-year. The Street consensus called for $0.26 per share.
Revenue came in at $198.1 million versus the year-ago figure of
$82.5 million. The company added a number of acquisitions in
order to expand its broadband and communications expertise and
serve larger markets this quarter. Purchases include Malleable
Technologies, Quantum Effect Devices, and Datum Telegraphic.

PRICELINE THINS ITS RANKS
The Internet discount company announced a third-quarter loss,
the resignation of its CFO, and a restructuring plan.

By Mike Trigg

Embattled name-your-price Internet discount company
priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) announced a third-quarter loss
after the market's close yesterday that met lowered Street
expectations. In addition, the company announced the resignation
of CFO Heidi Miller and a restructuring plan that includes
cutting 16% of its workforce.

Priceline posted a fiscal third-quarter (ended September 30) net
loss of $2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a lose of
$11.9 million, or $0.08 per share, a year ago. Revenue came in
at $341 million, slightly below expectations. Moreover, the
company forecasts a sequential revenue decline for the fourth
quarter, continuing to see signs of weak demand.

President and CEO Daniel Schulman blamed the revenue shortfall
on negative publicity and problems with its airline ticket
business. Priceline continues to be dogged by consumer
complaints, highlighted by the revelation that popular company
spokesman William Shatner has never used the services himself.
In the airline business, the company has experienced adverse
effects from rising fuel prices and airlines' own discounts.

Looking to perform some damage control, the company also
announced a number of restructuring moves. Priceline announced
it would fire 87 of its 535 employees, forcing it to take a
charge for an undisclosed amount that will hurt fourth-quarter
results. Also, the company will take a $9 million non-cash
charge due to a change in a warrant held by Delta Air Lines
(NYSE: DAL).

The company finished the quarter with $131 million in cash and
short-term investments, not all that bad depending on the burn
rate, although no guidance has been given. Nevertheless, the
debate still wages on with this company regarding the
survivability of is business model. With 80% of its revenues
derived from airline ticket sales, it comes as no surprise that
even the slightest misstep can cause damage. Of course, shutting
different business lines down, such as Priceline WebHouse Club,
only makes matters worse and leads many to question whether this
notion of diversification is fact or fiction. At this point, we
can only wait and see.

NEWS TO GO

Mobile phone equipment company Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) reported
better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results after the
market's close yesterday. However, revenues fell short of
expectations because of slow demand in its largest market, South
Korea. The San Diego-based company reported net income of $200.8
million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $182.9 million, or
$0.24 per share, in the same period last year. That beat the
Street consensus estimate by a penny. Revenues fell to $635
million from the year-ago figure of $716 million, a decrease of
11%. The revenue shortfall was caused by the South Korean
government, which banned mobile phone discounts, cutting demand.
Chairman and CEO Irwin Jacobs reiterated that CDMA-based
wireless data and Internet access applications would fuel
industry growth.

Information technology and consulting company Computer Sciences
(NYSE: CSC) reported second-quarter earnings that met Street
expectations, citing strong U.S. and international sales despite
difficult conditions in Australia and Europe. The company
reported earnings of $109 million, or $0.64 per share, compared
to $93.1 million, or $0.55 per share, a year ago. While
suffering from a weak euro, revenue still came in at $2.5
billion, a 12% increase from the year-ago period. Key
announcements in the quarter include a $3 billion contract from
Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT)

During an investors conference in Atlanta, United Parcel Service
(NYSE: UPS) discussed the company's current performance and
outlook. It noted that it's in-line to meet Street expectations
for the fourth quarter, but that there could be a slowdown in
the growth rate. For the coming year, company goals include
revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth in the
mid-teens, and a return on equity of about 30%. The world's
largest express carrier is also expecting a strong holiday
season with peak day deliveries of 19 million or greater.

The number three media company, Viacom (NYSE: VIA), announced
today it has agreed to acquire privately held BET Holding II,
the parent company of Black Entertainment Television. The deal
is valued at $3 billion in stock and debt. BET Chairman and
majority owner Robert Johnson will remain chairman and CEO of
the cable channel geared to African Americans. It joins a Viacom
portfolio that includes CBS, MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Paramount
films, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., and King World Productions.
Viacom Chairman and CEO Sumner Redstone noted regarding the
purchase that the addition of Robert Johnson, Black
Entertainment Television, and other holdings would contribute
significantly to the company's existing brands and management
expertise.

PEPSI BOTTLING CAPS THE S&P 500
PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) is the choice of the new S&P Generation.
Pepsi Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG), the cola company's leading
bottler, will be joining its sugar-water daddy in the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index over the weekend. The move is fitting since
both Coke (NYSE: KO) and its largest distributor, Coca Cola
Enterprises (NYSE: CCE), are already on board.

Terra firmer? Online giant Terra Networks (Nasdaq: TRLY)
reported a smaller-than-expected loss as cost-cutting helped
offset a sluggish advertising market. The Spanish standout,
whose buying spree eventually included the popular and then
profitable portal Lycos, saw revenues take a 6% dip. The company
also announced that it will lay off 15% of its workforce. I'll
be back to scratch beneath this story's surface later this
morning.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=405059

The Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) tolls, as the company announced that it
is cozy with first-quarter sales and earnings estimates but will
lay off some of its workers in the process. The company will let
go 3000 to 4000 employees -- as many as 10% of its workforce --
to offset falling demand and pricing pressures in the personal
computer space. Our own Mike Trigg (TMF Tonto) will take a
closer look at Dell's report later today.

Comcast's (Nasdaq: CMCSA) billion? The country's third-largest
cable television operator reported a cool billion-dollar
quarterly profit this morning -- but the 10-figure showing was
actually the result of large investment gains. Sales clocked in
13% higher, at $2.2 billion. Comcast is beginning to reap the
rewards of its costly buildout of digital broadband as
entertainment-starved consumers clamor for more cable channels
and faster Internet speeds.

In the beginning, Genesis Microchip (Nasdaq: GNSS) announced
earnings, and they were good. The company reported a 75% uptick
in revenue and a narrower-than-expected loss of $0.15 a share.
Catering to the flat-panel monitor market, which is anything but
flat nowadays, the integrated circuits maker also announced that
top-line growth would exceed projections over the next few
quarters.

REDBACK RAMPS UP
The network equipment maker quadruples revenues and reports its
first pro forma profit.

By Chris Rugaber

Network equipment maker Redback Networks (Nasdaq: RBAK) reported
third-quarter results after yesterday's market close, almost
quadrupling revenues to $80.6 million from last year's $20.6
million. On a pro forma basis, Redback eked out $3.2 million in
profit, or $0.02 per share, ahead of analysts' consensus
estimates of a $0.02 per share loss.

Including costs related to its acquisitions of Siara Systems and
Abatis Systems, as well as stock compensation expenses, the
company reported a loss of $308.1 million, or $2.50 per share.

Redback makes subscriber management systems that enable telecom
service providers to handle heavy traffic on high-speed
networks, including cable, DSL, and wireless connections. The
company also recently began ramping up sales of its optical
networking products, which are being used in regional fiber
optic networks.

The company, which was a Daily Double this spring, added 70 new
customers during the quarter, bringing its total to more than
300. This is particularly important for a company like Redback,
since many small networking equipment companies rely
inordinately on only a few customers, and can get slammed if
just one or two buyers delay or cancel a purchase. This may
still be an issue for Redback, however. While the company added
Qwest Communications' (NYSE: Q) U S West unit as a new customer,
the former Baby Bell accounted for 24% of the company's revenues
in the quarter.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152397

Redback's CFO Craig Genter told analysts in a conference call
that revenues should hit $100 million next quarter, and continue
to grow 20% each quarter next year. As a result, the company
expects sales to hit $645 million in 2001. While such growth is
impressive, at a market cap of $19 billion, the market clearly
expects great things from the company.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Among the many companies reporting earnings last night was
Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD), which beat analysts'
consensus estimates by two pennies. The microprocessor and flash
memory maker reported net income (excluding onetime charges) of
$219 million, or $0.64 per share, and sales of $1.2 billion. For
more info, check out yesterday's news report.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152398

Motorcycle maker Harley Davidson (NYSE: HDI) reported a solid
third quarter yesterday. Net income reached $83 million, or
$0.27 per share, a 27% increase over last year's $65.4 million,
or $0.21 per share. Sales were up 15% to $714.1 million. The
company, which makes over 25% of the heavyweight bikes sold
worldwide, shipped 48,077 motorcycles in the quarter, 13% more
than the year-earlier period, and expects to ship 203,000 this
year. However, sales did fall 38% in the company's Buell
division, which makes a lightweight bike called the Blast, and
which just maybe doesn't appeal to Harley's regular customers.
For more information on Harley Davidson, check out the Drip
Portfolio's recent analysis of the company.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152399

Fiber optic cable and components maker Corning (NYSE: GLW)
announced yesterday that third-quarter earnings would beat
analysts' estimates, thanks to strong demand. The company
expects to report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.34-$0.35 for
the quarter, 75% above last year's figure and ahead of consensus
estimates of $0.30 per share. For more information on fiber
optics components, be sure to check out our new Internet Report
on the subject.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=152400

Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST) reported
a 9% increase in fourth-quarter profit yesterday. Earnings
reached $200.2 million, or $0.43 per share, 10% higher than the
$0.39 per share reached a year ago. Sales rose 20% to $10.6
billion for the quarter. Same-store sales -- sales at warehouses
open at least a year -- were up 9%.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=152401

Fast food company Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM)
announced mixed third-quarter results last night, with net
income up 2.7% to $115 million, or $0.77 per share, ahead of
analysts' consensus estimates of $0.70. However, revenues
declined 8.5% to $1.66 billion from $1.81 billion in the
year-earlier period. The operator of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and
KFC restaurants also reported that same-store sales rose 1% at
Pizza Hut, fell 2% at Taco Bell (probably thanks to all that
great publicity over recalled shells), and were "little changed"

HEWLETT-PACKARD SETTLES GERMAN COPYRIGHT SUIT
The computer giant will pay for each past and future CD burner
sale.

By Tom Jacobs

Computer behemoth Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) settled German
copyright test case litigation Thursday. The company agreed to
pay GEMA, Germany's top licensing entity, $1.54 for each compact
disc (CD) burner sold since February 1998 and $5.16 for each
future sale. A CD burner allows illegal copying of music off the
Web and onto a personal CD. Industry experts estimate that $500
million is lost annually to CD pirating, with a total of 25
million pirated music files available online. Hewlett-Packard
closed at $35.56 Friday, up 5.57% and 10% above its 52-week low
of $32.63.

GEMA sued Hewlett-Packard in May because it's the German market
leader in CD burners. GEMA initially sought up to $12.90 per CD
burner, now often available for under $200. Hewlett-Packard
spokesperson Jeannette Weisschuh wouldn't estimate the cost to
the company, but she noted that foreign online retailers would
gain an advantage by selling cheaper CD burners -- without
having to pay the fees. "This was a trial to send an example for
the whole market," she said. "It's unfair to the consumers who
have to pay more and unfair to the manufactures because it gives
us a competitive disadvantage."

Most countries have agencies similar to GEMA (the U.S. has ASCAP
and BMI, for example), which collect license fees and pay them
to copyright owners through recording houses and music
distributors. Pre-digital-age copyright laws zapped makers of
equipment such as tape recorders and video players that could be
used to violate copyright laws, but now those laws have been
expanded into a world of CD burners, computer printers, hard
drives, and high-speed modems.

With music industry estimates of $5 billion a year lost through
bootlegging, other countries' licensing bodies are likely
watching Germany and making their own plans. Last Friday, Rex
Moore (TMF Orangeblood) covered developments in the U.S. with
online music file-sharing company Napster, now in cahoots with
-- get this -- German's media giant Bertelsmann.

NEWS TO GO

General Electric (NYSE: GE) ended speculation this morning by
naming Jeffrey R. Immelt, currently president and CEO of GE Medical
Systems, to succeed CEO Jack Welch when he retires at the end of 2001.
Effective immediately, Immelt is GE's president and chairman-elect,
and will serve on the GE board of directors and join Mr. Welch and
Vice Chairmen Dennis D. Dammerman and Robert C. Wright as a member
of the corporate executive office.

E-tailer Amazon.com's (Nasdaq: AMZN) website was down for 30
minutes the Friday after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest
shopping day of the year. Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said, "It
was totally internal, it was a bug in the system that is now
exterminated. It had nothing to do with holiday traffic." The
system was back up by 9:30 am.

After denying a possible merger with Gemstar-TV Guide (Nasdaq:
GMST) last Tuesday, bookseller Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS)
spokesperson Mary Ellen Keating on Friday would not rule it out,
saying that talks between the two companies spanned a wide range
of options.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=212089

Troubled cable and telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) stated it will
purchase no more equipment for cable upgrades from Antec Corp.
(Nasdaq: ANTC) or CommScope Inc. (NYSE: CTV) before next year.
The two companies' shares plummeted more than 20 % Friday on the
news. Shares of Scientific-Atlanta Inc. (NYSE: SFA), C-Cor.net
Corp. (Nasdaq: CCBL), and Harmonic (Nasdaq: HLIT), which also
sell cable TV equipment to AT&T, dropped on news they stopped
shipments. AT&T is Harmonic's biggest customer, and its shares
trade near a 52-week low due to continued losses and investor
concerns over AT&T's health.

Bloomberg reports that Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE: MWD)
has abandoned plans to buy Japan's Nippon Global Securities, and
instead will pursue its own retail offices in Japan. Many
international banks and brokerage firms have targeted Japan,
where most married households -- traditionally through the wives
-- maintained their savings in low or negative interest Post
Office accounts. Financial market liberalization -- the
so-called Big Bang -- has allowed foreign companies recently to
attack the Japanese securities market, known for requiring years
of building personal relationships to achieve business success.

"Only a fool holds out for the top dollar." -- Joseph Kennedy


AUTO SALES SLOWDOWN
After a bang-up year, car companies report slow sales in October.

By Chris Rugaber

To the surprise of some observers, many U.S. and international
automakers reported sales declines for the month of October,
with the exception of General Motors (NYSE: GM), which benefited
from heavy discounts. Figures from Autodata Corp. show that
industrywide sales fell 0.9% from October of last year, while
forecasts were for a 3.6% increase, according to a Bloomberg
report.

Sales of Ford's (NYSE: F) North American-built vehicles dropped
6.3%, partly due to a 16% decline in sales of its Explorer
model. Ford cut production of the Explorer in September in order
to redirect tires to the company's Explorer recall effort. The
Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) reported an 8.4%
drop, while Honda's (NYSE: HMC) sales fell 5.6% and Toyota
(NYSE: TM) experienced a 5.7% downturn. The monthly sales
decline was Honda's first since August 1998, and Toyota's first
since December 1999.

GM bucked the trend, reporting a 7% increase in sales. The
world's largest automaker increased its U.S. market share to
30.3%, up 2.1% since last October. What effect this will have on
the company's bottom line is unclear, given that the company
aggressively utilized cash-back incentives and low-rate loans,
partly in response to similar efforts from Chrysler. Yesterday,
GM announced new promotions for its full-size pickups, while
Chrysler said earlier this week that it would offer new
discounts for its 2001 minivans.

October's slowdown comes after robust sales earlier this year,
and the industry is still on track to beat last year's sales
record. Nevertheless, according to a Wall Street Journal report,
industry observers now forecast a decline next year, from an
estimated 17.2 million units in 2000 to 16.5 million in 2001,
and a 5% decline in production from the "Big Three" U.S.
automakers.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Media conglomerate Seagram (NYSE: VO) benefited from strong
music and film sales in its fiscal first quarter (ended
September 30), with profit from operations reaching $21 million,
or $0.05 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $0.03 per
share. Revenues dipped 2.9%, however, to $5.34 billion, which
the company attributed to the strong dollar and the sales of
several businesses. Paris-based Vivendi (NYSE: V) plans to
purchase Seagram and this may be the company's last report as an
independent entity. Shareholders for Seagram and Vivendi are
scheduled to vote on the transaction on December 5, with the
acquisition expected to close several days later.

Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) reported another decline in same-store
sales yesterday. The largest U.S. clothing chain announced that
October same-store sales dropped 2%, thanks to discounts on
back-to-school merchandise. CFO Heidi Kunz said that the company
expects a "significant" decline in gross margin for the third
quarter (ended October 28), according to a Bloomberg report, and
that earnings will be between $0.20 and $0.22 per share, below
current estimates of $0.23 per share. Prior to lowering
expectations in August, estimates were for the company to earn
$0.41 per share.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=179470

Domestic queen Martha Stewart Omnimedia (NYSE: MSO) reported
strong revenue and earnings growth this morning, thanks to sales
increases in the company's publishing, television, and
Internet/direct commerce divisions. Net income more than doubled
from the year-ago period to $3.8 million, or $0.08 per share,
handily beating analysts' estimates of $0.01 per share. Revenue
increased 24.2% to $61.9 million, from $49.8 million in last
year's third quarter.

Laser-maker Coherent (Nasdaq: COHR) cut through fourth-quarter
analysts' estimates last night, reporting strong sales and
earnings growth and sending the company's shares up in
after-hours trading. Sales jumped 18% over last year's fourth
quarter to $155 million, and net income, excluding an
extraordinary gain, was up 56% to $11.4 million, or $0.45 per
share. The company was expected to earn $0.36 per share.
Revenues for the full year were up 21% to $568.3 million, and
earnings were up 61% to $36.3 million. Coherent also reported an
after-tax gain of $32.3 million from its 60% ownership in a
German subsidiary that went public in September.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- Q. What does it mean when a company is said to be "stuffing
the channel"? A company I was interested in has been accused of
this.

-- A. When a company stuffs the channel, it ships inventory
ahead of schedule, filling its distribution channels with more
product than is needed. Since companies often record sales as
soon as they ship products, channel stuffing can make it appear
that business is booming. In reality, the products not sold may
well be returned to the manufacturer. This means sales already
claimed may never occur. In a sense, sales from past quarters
are made at the expense of sales in future quarters.

See if accounts receivable growth is outpacing sales growth. If
so, that's a red flag. Alternatively, calculate "days sales
outstanding" (DSO). First, divide the last four quarters'
revenues by 365. Then divide accounts receivable by that number.
This reveals how many days' worth of sales the current accounts
receivable represents. Between 30 and 45 days is typical. You
can also follow the same process for the last quarter, dividing
last quarter's revenues by 91.25 (days in a quarter, on
average).

A company with a low DSO is getting its cash back quicker and,
ideally, putting it immediately to use, getting an edge on the
competition. Rising numbers can signify channel stuffing.
Remember this isn't useful for all companies. Restaurants and
cash-based businesses, for example, aren't going to have much,
if any, receivables.

-- Q. What's a holding company?

-- A. Holding companies own the securities of other firms. They
usually maintain voting control of these companies, as well. A
good example is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns
GEICO, See's candy and Dexter shoes.

INVESTING BASICS - ONLINE ATTRACTIONS

We're probably preaching to the choir here. Odds are you're a
somewhat seasoned computer user. Even so, though, you might do a
friend a favor by printing out the following article and
offering it to an offline friend, along with a little discussion
about why you find the Internet so darn useful.

Online. There's no place like it. Each day, more and more people
are using the Internet to find information, jobs, homes and
apartments, and friends. You've heard us sing of the way that
cyberspace is revolutionizing investing. It's got a lot to offer
you in many other arenas, as well.

Take shopping. You probably already know that you can buy books
and music online, at sites such as amazon.com and half.com. But
you can also head to wal-mart.com and buy an outdoor grill
without leaving your house. Visit 1800flowers.com and choose a
bouquet of flowers to be sent to your sweetie from the comfort
of your desk at work. Find items you collect, such as comic
books or antiques, on sale at auction sites like ebay.com. Apply
for and get a mortgage for your new home at eloan.com.

lot of time and money to get. Many sites, such as fool.com and
marketguide.com, offer much data and information -- for free. At
the Fool, for example, you can scour our message boards for
opinions on companies, read through our news and portfolio
reports, and set up and track your portfolio's progress. Visit
excite.transium.com and you can read articles from a company's
industry trade journals.

The Internet has much to offer just about anyone, from kids
(agirllikeu.com and nick.com) to seniors (thirdage.com and
aarp.com). Besides Web sites, there's e-mail, which allows you
to communicate instantly and inexpensively with friends around
the world. You owe it to yourself to explore cyberspace at least
a little. If you don't have a computer, ask a friend with one to
give you an online tour. Many public libraries offer computer
access, as well.

ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. I'm embarrassed to ask such a basic question, but here
goes. What does it mean when I hear, "AT&T is up 2 1/2 today"?
Is that dollars per share, or what?

-- A. Don't be embarrassed. Most of us were never taught these
things in school. Asking about them is the only way to learn.

Prices of stocks are always in dollars per share. They're not
always in whole numbers, though. The world of stock prices is
full of fractions, all the way down to 64ths and occasionally
even smaller ones. So if the film editing firm Splice Girls Inc.
(ticker: SPLIC) is listed at 28, that means it last traded at
$28 per share. Similarly, 15 17/32 means 15.53125 or $15.53 per
share.

Another way to think of it is to consider how much total market
value the company has gained or lost with each price move. Find
how many shares outstanding the company has. (Do this via online
stock research tools, your newspaper or the firm's financial
statements.) Multiply that number by the share price. If SPLIC
has 200 million shares outstanding and drops by $2 per share,
the company has lost $400 million in market value.

-- Q. What are buy-side and sell-side analysts?

-- A. Buy-side analysts work in-house for institutions such as
mutual funds or pension funds. They study possible investments
and recommend which securities the institutions should buy or
sell. Sell-side analysts work for brokerages, trying to sell
their ideas to institutions. If an institution likes a
brokerage's research, it might do business (placing trades)
through that brokerage.

The research of sell-side analysts also makes its way to
individual investors, through brokerages.

_________________________________________________________________


INVESTING BASICS - THE EARNINGS YIELD

One way to think about what you're paying for a company is to
consider its price-to-earnings ratio, or "P/E." Another way is
to calculate its inverse, which is its "earnings yield."

Consider the example of Fryyndar and Ulf Scandinavian
Pharmaceuticals (ticker: FANDU), whose motto is "Vars+god och
sv,lj!" (That's Swedish for "Here, swallow this pill!") To
calculate its P/E ratio, you simply divide the current stock
price by the annual earnings per share (EPS). If its current
annual EPS is $3 and the stock is trading for $111 per share,
the P/E is $111 divided by $3, or 37. While 37 might seem steep,
it's not meaningful until you compare it with the P/E ratios of
industry peers and consider its growth prospects. A high P/E
means the market is assuming rapid growth. (Is that assumption
reasonable?)

To calculate Fryyndar and Ulf's earnings yield, just reverse the
P/E ratio, dividing the annual EPS by the current stock price.
$3 divided by $111 equals 0.027, or 2.7 percent. Compared to
risk-free Treasury bond rates of roughly 5 percent, this doesn't
appear to be a bargain. But remember: Whereas bond rates are
fixed, earnings typically grow. Imagine that FANDU is expected
to increase earnings by 10 percent per year. If so, in 10 years
EPS should grow to $7.78. Assuming we bought shares when they
were at $111, the earnings yield for us has now become 7
percent, considerably better. ($7.78 divided by $111 is 0.07.)

It can be instructive to see how long it takes for the growing
earnings yield to pass the current 30-year bond rate, which is
now about 5.5 percent. FANDU passes it in six years.

If your desired rate of return on your invested dollars is 15
percent, it will take FANDU 18 years to reach that target -- if
earnings actually grow at the estimated pace, that is. Perhaps
you can find another investment that will get you there more
quickly. With riskier companies, you might look for them to pass
your target rate sooner rather than later.

The earnings yield is just one of many investor tools. It can
help you think more effectively about your expectations for
investments.

the Hill" article.

companies for investors.

"My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in
the fewness of my wants." -- J. Brotherton

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

COMPAQ DOES NOT COMPUTE
Hardware specialist Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) reported lackluster
first-quarter results. Sales and operating profits of $9.2
billion and $200 million, respectively, declined during the
period with Compaq falling short of analyst earnings estimates.
Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) continued to eat away at the company's
computing market share. Compaq also announced 2000 layoffs, on
top of 5000 jobs that were slashed just last month.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=396920

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Call waiting? Third-generation (3G) cell phone services will be
put on hold as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NYSE: NTT)
subsidiary DoCoMo will be delaying its May 30 launch until
October in order to fully test the network. Enabling faster
rates of wireless data transmission, 3G is the key to
revolutionary information services through your handset. Until
then, it'll just be another space on the Battleship grid.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=396921

The quest for success ends at Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX). The
lab diagnostics specialist reported that earnings more than
doubled to $35.7 million -- or $0.74 a share. That was 11 cents
higher than analyst expectations. The company sees 50%
bottom-line growth this year on a modest 5-7% uptick in sales.
In other words, the lab results are in and the prognosis on
margin expansion looks pretty healthy.

Chips and dips. Novellus (Nasdaq: NVLS) reported an 8.7% slide
in sequential income growth while still managing to quadruple
profits. The microchip equipment maker announced that shipments
fell by 13.5% during the quarter. The semi stocks continue to
feel the hurt as the book-to-bill ratio -- the gauge for
determining chip demand by pitting orders against actual
shipments -- sank for the seventh consecutive month.

Once a data-munching beast, Informix (Nasdaq: IFMX) will now be
selling its database unit to IBM (NYSE: IBM) for a billion in
cash. The asset sale was reported along with first-quarter
results, which fell both sequentially and year-over-year for the
Massachusetts-based company.

So happy together, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) -- the result of
the merger between Glaxo Pharmaceuticals and SmithKline Beecham
-- reported its first quarterly financials since its union.
Results came in ahead of expectations, and -- given merger cost
savings -- GlaxoSmithKline is comfortable with its 13% earnings
growth guidance for the full year.

NEWS CORP. REPORTS DROP IN EARNINGS
The company's profits decline due to a ratings downturn at the
Fox TV network.

By Chris Rugaber

Multinational media conglomerate News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) reported
a decline in profits for its fiscal first quarter last night,
thanks to an accounting change and reduced ad revenues from its
Fox TV network.

After-tax operating profit fell to $149 million, or $0.14 per
American depositary receipt (ADR), from $165 million, or $0.16
per ADR, in the year-earlier period. (Like most other non-U.S.
based companies, News Corp. shares trade as ADRs.) The reduced
profits did meet average analysts' estimates. Revenues rose 2.6%
to $3.24 billion.

Thanks to a change in accounting for the company's film
business, News Corp. took a non-cash charge of $417 million,
resulting in a net loss for the quarter of $268 million, or
$0.27 per ADR. All Hollywood studios have been adjusting their
finances to reflect new accounting standards, which affect
marketing and development costs, among other things.

The decline in News Corp.'s operating profits was primarily a
result of lower ratings and advertising revenue for the Fox TV
network, which suffered from the success of CBS's Survivor and
the Olympics on NBC. The No. 4 U.S. network posted an operating
loss of $31 million, compared to $20 million in operating
earnings a year earlier. The network also reported higher
production and marketing costs, which may explain all those
promotions for the new series Dark Angel.

As a result, News Corp.'s separately traded U.S. media
subsidiary, the Fox Entertainment Group (NYSE: FOX), which owns
the television network and the 20th Century Fox film studio,
reported a 16% drop in fiscal first-quarter operating profit.
While the film studio's cash flow almost doubled to $119
million, from $62 million a year ago -- thanks largely to the
success of the movie X-Men -- this did not offset the declines
in television ad revenues.

Overall, profits declined in three of the six operating
divisions of the company -- television, magazines, and newspapers
-- while earnings improved for the movie studio, cable, and publishing
businesses. CEO Rupert Murdoch noted in a conference call that the company
planned to proceed with an IPO of its satellite unit, Sky Global
Networks, in the first calendar quarter of next year.

NEWS TO GO

The tougher climate for online businesses claimed more
casualties yesterday, as B2B holding company Internet Capital
Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) announced that it would cut 50 jobs, or 35%
of its workforce, and take a charge of $25 million to $30
million to pay for the cuts. The company's shares fell $3.50 in
after-hours trading to $12.75, on top of a 90% drop so far this
year. Investors in the company may be relieved to know that,
according to CEO Walter Buckley, "We're very much moving from a
land grab area to an execution area."

The drama continues at speech-recognition company Lernout &
Hauspie (Nasdaq: LHSP), makers of Dragon and Dictaphone
software, as the company's co-founders stepped down from their
executive positions today. The company will also delay its 10-Q
filing as it restates results for 1998, 1999, and the first half
of this year due to errors the company found in an internal
audit. But wait, there's more bad news: The company also said
that third-quarter revenue would fall short of previous
forecasts by about 24%.

ABC's hit show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? continues to
reward parent company Disney (NYSE: DIS), which today reported a
fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $167 million, or $0.11 per
share, thanks in part to increased ad sales at ABC. Excluding
the company's Internet properties, Disney earned $0.20 per
share, $0.02 ahead of consensus estimates. The company lost $126
million, or $0.02 per share, in last year's fiscal fourth
quarter. Revenues rose 5.8% to $6.12 billion. For the full year,
the company reported revenue growth of 9% to $25 billion, and
net income of $1.9 billion, or $1.92 per share.

Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:
BRK.A) announced last night that it will purchase paint maker
Benjamin Moore for about $1 billion in cash. Berkshire will pay
$37.82 per share for the company, a 51% premium to yesterday's
closing price. New Jersey-based Benjamin Moore makes home
exterior and interior paints, and is the second housing-related
acquisition for Berkshire in recent months. The company
purchased carpet-maker Shaw Industries in September.

COMPAQ UNSURPRISINGLY WARNS
Computer maker Compaq became a member of the warnings club
yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) joined its PC-related brethren
yesterday on the warning train. Gateway Computer (NYSE: GTW),
Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), and Advanced Micro
Devices (NYSE: AMD) have all warned the Street recently that
sales and earnings in their fourth quarters would be below expectations.

Compaq lowered guidance for the fourth quarter and for its next
fiscal year after the close of market yesterday. It also
announced that it will take a non-cash charge in the fourth
quarter related to the decline in value of some of its investments.

Compaq's revenues for the fourth quarter will now be between
$11.2 billion and $11.4 billion. That's below the expected $12.3
billion, but still above last year's $10.4 billion. Compaq
expects earnings, minus charges, to be in the range of
$0.28-$0.30 a share. Analysts were looking for $0.36 a share.
Compaq earned $0.19 a share last year.

The company blamed weak sales of its computers to U.S. consumers
and businesses, and softness in the demand for its servers.
Compaq is optimistic about the next fiscal year, but did lower
its guidance for results.

Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas said, "Our current 2001 plan
calls for 10% revenue growth and 25% growth in earnings per
share over the revised estimates for the fiscal year 2000.
Although this is lower than our previous guidance, it still
reflects strong year-over-year improvement." According to First
Call/Thompson Financial, analysts expected earnings to grow
about 40% in the next fiscal year.

Compaq also said that it will take a non-operating, non-cash
charge in the fourth quarter, related to the decline of some of
its investments. Internet incubator CMGI (Nasdaq: CMGI) and its
related assets are the main holdings that are causing this move.

NEWS TO GO

Biotech company Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) announced share repurchase
plans yesterday after the bell. The company plans to buy back up
to $2 billion in common stock between January 1, 2001 and
December 2002. Amgen also said that President and CEO Kevin
Sharer will be adding chairman to his title. The current
chairman, Gordon Binder, will retire December 31, as previously
announced.

Retailer Claire's Stores (NYSE: CLE) will miss fourth-quarter
earnings estimates. The company said yesterday that it sees
earnings per share for the fourth quarter of between $0.70 and
$0.80. Analysts had expected $1.12 a share. The company blamed
slow sales for the disappointing results.

Embedded computer maker Radisys (Nasdaq: RSYS) warned yesterday
that it will not meet current earnings and sales expectations.
Radisys is looking for fourth-quarter revenue of around $83
million, versus the $90.7 million it originally predicted.
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter will be between $0.20
and $0.24. Analysts, and the company itself, expected $0.41 a
share. The company also said that the first quarter of its new
fiscal year should return results about flat with the
fourth-quarter results. Analysts had expected Radisys to have
earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.42.

Internet consulting firm Razorfish (Nasdaq: RAZF) cut its
fourth-quarter outlook yesterday. This is the second time the
company has done so. Razorfish now expects to post a loss of
between $0.17 and $0.22 a share for the quarter, excluding
certain charges. Analysts were expecting a profit of $0.02 a
share.

QUESTIONS LEFT FOR ASK JEEVES TO ANSWER
The Internet search engine issued a waning yesterday, proving it
doesn't have all the answers.

By Mike Trigg

Internet know-it-all Ask Jeeves (Nasdaq: ASKJ), the provider of
a search engine that answers all our questions, issued an
earnings warning after the market's close yesterday. The company
attributed the shortfall to a slowing economy and reluctance
among companies to make additional outlays on online
advertisements. What's more, CEO Rob Wrubel also stepped down.

The Emeryville, California-based company, which makes money
through advertising and licensing, expects revenues of $25
million for the fourth quarter, about $10 million, or 30%, less
than the Street was expecting. Ask Jeeves also expects to post a
pro forma net loss of $18 million, or $0.50 per share, well
below the Street consensus of a $0.33-per-share loss. In the
previous quarter, the company posted a smaller-than-expected
loss of $12.6 million, or $0.36 per share.

"The broad-based economic slowdown has caused weakness in the
online advertising market, advertising pricing pressure, and a
decreased sense of urgency among Fortune 1000 companies to
implement their online initiatives," President Adam Klein said.
"Amongst this and other factors, we have experienced
weaker-than-anticipated demand for our solutions, however our
relationships with existing customers remain strong."

In other news, after more than two years on the job, CEO Rob
Wrubel will be stepping down from his board and CEO positions,
and assuming the role of executive vice president of market
development. (The Motley Fool interviewed Rubel back in
December.) Current board member George Battle will assume the
CEO position on an interim basis, while the company looks for a
replacement.

After becoming a Street favorite, even receiving Motley Fool
Daily Double recognition, and hitting its 52-week high of $144,
the stock was punished along with the rest of the e-commerce
sector at the beginning of the year. The recent shortfall
shouldn't come as a complete shock. Advertising makes up a great
deal of the company's revenues and, with the dot-com demise,
demand for online advertising has diminished. Even Rule Maker
Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) has been hurt this year, in part, over
similar concerns.

Despite the unfortunate news, the company still remains
optimistic. Regarding 2001 revenue and earnings guidance, the
company for once wasn't giving all the answers, saying that it
was reviewing growth targets. Nevertheless, Ask Jeeves maintains
it has enough cash in the "engine" to keep answering questions
until reaching expected profitability in the fourth quarter of
2001. Whether that's the case will be the biggest question left
for the company to answer.

NEWS TO GO

Not long ago, a 23-year-old former employee of Internet Wire
produced a phony press release, falsely reporting that the CEO
of Emulex (Nasdaq: EMLX) had resigned, the company was restating
earnings, and there was a pending investigation by the SEC. The
hoax resulted in Emulex shares tumbling nearly 60% in one day.
It appears the maker of computer cards that increase data
transmission has moved beyond all that, announcing an agreement
to acquire closely held computer-networking company Giganet for
$645 million in stock. Emulex announced that it would issue
about 4 million shares and assumed options for Giganet. The
price was based on yesterday's closing price for Emulex shares,
$155.75. While not expected to reduce per-share profits for the
fiscal year (ending July 1), upon completing the acquisition,
the company plans on taking a non-cash charge of $10 million.

According to a statement published on the Standard & Poor's
website, copyright protection solutions provider Macrovision
(Nasdaq: MVSN) will be added to the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400
Index after the market's close on December 8. It will replace energy
services holding company LG&E Energy Corp. (NYSE: LGE).

Microwave telecommunications products maker California Amplifier
(Nasdaq: CAMP) issued a fourth-quarter earnings warning and
reported third-quarter results. The company expects earnings of
$0.08 or $0.09 per share and revenues between $29 million and
$31 million in the fourth quarter. The Street consensus estimate
called for the company to earn $0.17 per share. Moreover,
California Amplifier also reported third-quarter earnings of
$2.29 million, or $0.16 a share, meeting the Streets
expectations. Sales climbed to $32.6 million compared to $26.3
million in the same period last year.

Computer products seller CDW Computer Centers Inc. (Nasdaq:
CDWC) announced in a press release that it expects earnings
between $0.40 per share and $0.42 per share in the fourth
quarter. That's below the Street consensus expectation of $0.50
per share. The company also expects revenue to be between $990
million and $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year sales
growth between 34% and 36%. "Currently, we are facing
slower-than-expected demand due to economic uncertainties, which
we believe is an industry-wide phenomenon," CEO Michael Krasny
said in a statement. "These economic uncertainties make us
cautious about 2001, when we believe CDW will continue to
increase market share, but grow sales at lower rates than recent
quarters."

Maker of liquid crystal displays for mobile phones Three-Five
Systems Inc. (NYSE: TFS) announced that it expects a
fourth-quarter profit between $0.08 and $0.10 per share, well
below earlier profit guidance of $0.19 to $0.20 per share. The
Street consensus expectation called for the company to earn
$0.20 per share. The company also informed investors that it was
expecting sales between $36 million and $38 million. It had been
expecting $45 million in revenues. Commenting on the coming
year, President and CEO Jack L. Saltich remarked, "Our guidance
for 2001 remains unchanged. On a relative basis, sequential
revenue growth in the first quarter is expected, and that growth
should be in the range of 8% to 10%."

"I'm opposed to millionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer
me the position." -- Mark Twain


INFOSPACE MAKES MONEY FROM WIRELESS
The company reported a tripling in sales and estimate-beating
earnings yesterday.

By Chris Rugaber

Internet content aggregator InfoSpace (Nasdaq: INSP) reported
third-quarter financial results after yesterday's market close.
The company almost tripled revenues, and posted operating
profits of $9.47 million, or $0.03 per share, up from $2.97
million, or $0.01 per share, in last year's third quarter.
Analysts expected the company to break even, before acquisition
and amortization costs. Including those expenses, InfoSpace lost
$48.7 million, or $0.17 per share.

Revenues jumped to $57.7 million, from $19.9 million in the
year-earlier period, thanks in part to increasing sales to
wireless service providers, such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Alltel
(NYSE: AT), and Cingular Wireless, the partnership between SBC
Communications (NYSE: SBC) and BellSouth (NYSE: BLS). InfoSpace
enables wireless carriers to provide content and services such
as news, maps, and email for their wireless Web offerings. The
company reported that it counts 20 wireless carriers worldwide
as its customers.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169495

InfoSpace also provides broadband and wireline Internet
services, and the company recently expanded its reach with its
purchase of website operator Go2Net, which closed during the
quarter. "InfoSpace is better positioned than ever to leverage
four parallel areas with massive promise: wireless, merchant,
broadband, and wireline consumer services," said CEO Arun Sarin
in a prepared statement.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=169496

After skyrocketing last winter, the company's stock fell almost
as swiftly, declining 62% so far this year. Nevertheless, shares
rose in overnight trading as high as $24.50, from yesterday's
close at $20.31.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Just as PlayStation 2 units go on sale in the U.S., Sony Corp.
(NYSE: SNE) reported a 57% drop in profits for its fiscal second
quarter. Net income was down to 19.8 billion yen ($183 million),
from 46.5 billion yen ($430 million) in the year-earlier period.
Analysts' estimates were for 26.6 billion yen in profit. Revenue
rose only 3.7% to 1.69 trillion yen. Sales of the company's
electronic products were strong, and accounted for 80% of sales
in the quarter, but were offset by a 17% drop in revenue from
game operations and an 18% drop in sales from the music
division.

Electronic manufacturing services company SCI Systems (NYSE:
SCI) announced a 22% increase in sales and a 24% jump in
earnings yesterday for its first quarter 2001 (ended September
24). Net income reached $50.5 million, or $0.34 per share,
compared to $0.28 in the year-ago period. "Continued
telecommunication product diversification and a lower sales
concentration in PC finished products led to higher operating
margins in the quarter," CEO Gene Sapp noted in a prepared statement.

Biotech company Chiron Corp. (Nasdaq: CHIR) reported a 30% jump
in third-quarter profits after yesterday's market close. Net
income reached $43.1 million, or $0.23 per share, up from $33
million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-earlier period, and
ahead of analysts' estimates of $0.17 per share. Sales of the
company's vaccines rose 11% to $78 million, while the company's
lead drug, Proleukin, brought in $21 million in revenue,
compared to $19 million in last year's third quarter. Some
analysts expected sales of Proleukin to reach $30 million. The
company's shares dropped about $2, or 4%, in after-hours
trading.

Internet security and name-registration company VeriSign
(Nasdaq: VRSN) blew away third-quarter estimates, reporting an
operating profit last night (excluding acquisition costs) of
$38.4 million, or $0.18 per share, significantly higher than the
$0.06 per share analysts expected. Sales leapt to $173.1 million
from $22.8 million a year ago. The company benefited from a full
quarter of business from newly acquired domain registrar Network
Solutions, which VeriSign purchased in June. For more
information on VeriSign, check out our Network Security Internet Report.

"One hundred thousand lemmings can't be wrong." -- Graffito


3COM DISAPPOINTS
Can a cash-rich balance sheet offset a slowdown in orders?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

There was a time when 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) networking equipment
and U.S. Robotics modems meant techie heaven. That time has long
since gone. Citing a shortage of parts and a slowdown in orders
from telco carriers, the company warned that third-quarter
results would come in softer than expected.

3Com is now projecting revenues for the period to come in
between $765 million and $780 million -- more than $100 million
below analyst estimates. A loss of $0.19 to $0.23 a share is
also nearly three times as wide as Wall Street's forecast for an
$0.08 deficit.

3Com had already begun to fade away from the investing community
radar. Once the company completed its spin-off of personal
desktop assistant maker Palm (Nasdaq: PALM) back in July, growth
investors had little reason to stick around. Standard & Poor's
felt the same way. It ditched the company in favor of its Palm
sprout for its S&P 500 Index.

While there are no guarantees, shareholders might take solace in
knowing that 3Com remains cash-rich. With $2.7 billion in cash
and short-term investments, the company is stacked with $7.75 a
share in greenbacks. In theory that should help limit the
downside not much farther below the $9.50 the stock was fetching
in after-hours trading yesterday. But even that may prove to be
knobby-kneed shelter if losses continue to widen. However, 3Com
believes that the carrier orders have simply been put on hold --
not hung up on the receiver. Shareholders better hope that 3Com
is making the right call this time.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

A slowdown in orders will also be taking a toll on Xilinx
(Nasdaq: XLNX) this quarter. The specialty chip maker warned
that it too would be reporting revenues short of analyst
expectations. Like its rival Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR), who had
warned just last week, an inventory backlog will not be a
painless fix.

It's time to pay for play at MP3.com (Nasdaq: MPPP). The popular
digital music site has now unveiled a "Premier Service" upgrade
to its existing My.MP3.com listening solution. For $49.95 a
year, users can beam up to 500 CDs to their account and stream
as many as 300 songs in a row without interruption. While the
free service never capped the allowable discs, it did have to be
restarted after playing every 50 selections. So much for the
free music revolution -- though the free basic My.MP3.com
service seems set to continue.

Finland's Nokia (NYSE: NOK) should give the wireless sector a
roaming charge this morning after the top dog announced that it
expects revenues to grow in the 25-35% range through at least
2003. Nokia controls nearly a third of the global wireless
handset market.

While weakness in online advertising is certainly not news
anymore, industry leader DoubleClick (Nasdaq: DCLK) confirmed
the malaise by sending out pink slips yesterday. The layoffs are
minor relative to other realignment sackings -- less than 10% of
its workforce -- but it does confirm the hard times in the realm of
Internet marketing. Brother, can you spare a banner ad click?

The thong throng? According to Bloomberg.com, News Corp. (NYSE:
NWS) and Disney (NYSE: DIS) have received European Council
approval to team up with Brazil's Globosat Programadora for a
joint venture in the latter's home turf. So an Australian media
giant teams up with a stateside titan and a local behemoth to
produce Brazilian television programming -- and Europe nods?
It's a small world after all.

"It's kind of fun to do the impossible."-- Walt Disney


NORTEL'S THIRD QUARTER
Nortel Networks reports its Q3 results, with revenues and
earnings both growing.

By LouAnn Lofton

Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT) announced third-quarter results
yesterday after the market's closing bell. The company met
earnings expectations, but perceived top-line growth weakness
sent shares of the Canadian telecommunications company
plummeting as much as 20% in after-hours trading.

Nortel's income from operations, which excludes certain
acquisition costs, was $574 million, or $0.18 a share. In last
year's third quarter, the company's operating income was $314
million, and earnings per share (EPS) was $0.11. Analysts as
polled by First Call/Thompson Financial were looking for $0.17 a
share.

Revenues for Nortel increased 42% over last year's $5.15 billion
to $7.31 billion. Many analysts, though, were looking for
Nortel's revenues to come in between $7.5 and $7.63 billion. It
was this "shortfall" that sent Nortel's shares down in
after-hours trading.

Nortel saw its strongest growth from its optical networking
business, where revenues grew by 90% compared to last year. Its
wireless Internet solutions business also did very well, with
revenues up 50% in this quarter versus the year-ago quarter.

The company reiterated that it sees its revenue growth for 2000
in the low-40% range. It raised its target for EPS from
operations growth to the same range as revenue growth, up from
the previously expected high-30% level.

John Roth, Nortel's president and chief executive officer, said,
"We are extremely pleased with the strong growth in the quarter,
which reflected our continued strength and leadership in the key
growth areas of Optical Internet, Wireless Internet, Local
Internet and eBusiness Solutions. Carriers and service providers
around the world continued the drive to provide a broad range of
wireless, internet and eBusiness services to their customers."

AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE

AMAZON'S SOLID THIRD QUARTER
By LouAnn Lofton
E-commerce company Amazon.com reported its third-quarter results
today after the bell. Its pro forma net loss widened, but the
company's revenues and loss per share came in ahead of
expectations. Other positives included a growing gross margin,
key expenses shrinking, and an expanding customer base. The
company also used less cash in its operations for the quarter
than it did last year. This hurdle behind it, all eyes now turn
to the all-important holiday shopping season.

EXCITE@HOME'S THIRD QUARTER
By Nico Detourn
The company added a record number of subscribers during the

may have more influence on near-term perception of the company
than will the details its operational performance.

NEWS TO GO

Compaq Computer (NYSE: CPQ) reported third-quarter results
yesterday after the market's close. The computer maker said that
net income for the quarter, including an investment gain, was
$550 million, or $0.31 a share. Minus the gain, Compaq earned
$0.30 a share, which was ahead of analysts' expectations by a
penny. Sales grew 22% to $11.2 billion. Michael Capellas,
Compaq's chief executive officer, said, "Our revenue was the
highest in Compaq's history." In a conference call, Compaq CFO
Jesse Greene said that the weak euro will negatively impact
Compaq's fourth-quarter results by up to $100 million in pre-tax
profits. Compaq now expects earnings per share in the fourth
quarter to be about $0.37, below the current estimate of $0.41.

Chip maker LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI) announced third-quarter
earnings yesterday. Net income, excluding special items, more
than doubled to $114 million, from $55 million last year. On a
per-share basis, LSI Logic earned $0.33, compared to $0.17 in
the year-ago period. The consensus estimate according to First
Call/Thompson Financial for LSI Logic's third period was $0.32.
Revenues at the company increased 35% to $728 million. Wilfred
Corrigan, LSI's chief executive officer, said the company is
comfortable with fourth-quarter estimates of $0.36 a share.

Long-distance telephone company AT&T (NYSE: T) reported
third-quarter results this morning. Earnings, excluding onetime
items, fell 12% to $1.44 billion, or $0.38 a share, from $1.63
billion, or $0.50 a share, last year. Analysts were expecting
$0.36 a share. AT&T's sales rose 4% to $16.98 billion. Strong
wireless and data sales were overshadowed by AT&T's declining
sales of its long-distance services to residential customers.
Sales to consumers fell 11%, while corporate sales increased
2.5%. AT&T also announced that, as rumored, it will break up
into four smaller companies. The restructuring is expected to be
done in 2002.

Entertainment and media company Viacom (NYSE: VIA) announced
third-quarter earnings this morning. Viacom's net income was $33
million, down from last year's $97 million. On a per-share
basis, Viacom earned $0.02, compared to $0.14 in the year-ago
period. Analysts had expected Viacom to lose $0.02 a share.
Sales at the company grew 79% to $6 billion from $3.3 billion
last year. Higher taxes and costs associated with the company's
purchase of CBS affected results, though Viacom did see strong
advertising revenue growth.

ASK THE FOOL

This weekly e-mail offers answers to questions that perplex most
beginning and intermediate investors and throws in an
investing-related lesson, as well. Enjoy!

-- What causes mortgage rates to rise and fall?

-- A. They fluctuate along with other interest rates. Interest
rates are affected chiefly by inflation and the market for debt
(notes, bills, and bonds, among other instruments). With
inflation extremely low in recent years, we've enjoyed low
interest rates. But if signs of inflation begin to pop up, it's
expected that the Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, will
hike up short-term interest rates via an adjustment in the rate
of interest on "federal funds." The "fed funds" rate is the rate
of interest a bank can charge another bank for use of its excess
money. The Fed can also change the "discount rate," or the rate
paid by a bank to borrow short-term funds from the Fed. The
prime rate and other rates (such as mortgage rates) are based
primarily on these two interest rates.

The Fed raises these interest rates when the economy appears to
be growing too briskly, which can spur inflation. When the
economy is sluggish, it might cut these rates in order to give
American enterprise a boost. Lower rates give companies and
people (including house-shoppers) an incentive to borrow money.
However, remember that the money markets themselves (basic
supply and demand for money at each price point) exert the
biggest influence over interest rates, though the Fed is a big
influence on market expectations.

INVESTING BASICS - GATHERING COMPANY INFORMATION

You're intrigued by Wookie Cookies Inc. (ticker: CHEWY) and
being a good Foolish investor, you want to research it. Simply
give the firm a jingle and ask the investor relations department
to send you an investor information package. (They're free!)
Tell them you'd like to receive the most recent annual report,
the latest 10-K and 10-Q reports, any recent press releases, and
any available analyst reports. Alternatively, you can save a few
trees by gathering the information immediately online at
freeEdgar.com.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=3D207902

The annual report will probably feature glossy photos of smiling
customers (or assorted alien life forms) chomping on cookies.
But look to the back of the report where the numbers will tell
you the real story about the business. There are three main
financial statements there. The income statement shows the
company's sales and profits. The balance sheet lists assets and
liabilities, such as cash, inventories and debt. The statement
of cash flows reveals where cash is coming from and going to.

These statements also appear in the 10-Q and 10-K reports. The
10-K is issued once a year, along with the annual report, and
10-Qs are issued thrice a year, at the end of the intervening
quarters. The 10-Q summarizes quarterly performance, while the
10-K features a lengthy discussion of the firm's operations and
challenges.

Financial statements reveal how quickly sales are growing, how
the company is financing its growth, how much profit it's
making, and much more. Pay attention to trends, to see if the
firm's financial health is improving or declining. Compare the
company with its industry peers, to see how it stacks up.

Remember that you can improve your chances for success if you're
actually a consumer of Wookie Cookies and are familiar with the
company's offerings. Also, talk about the business with other
investors, perhaps in an investment club.

Don't neglect online resources. Most company Web sites feature
an investor information section, with press releases, financial
statements, annual reports, and answers to frequently-asked
questions. Investor information sites like ours at fool.com
also offer a wealth of information on companies and communities
of investors sharing information.

VA LINUX DOWN, BUT NOT OUT
Open-source software provider VA Linux reported first-quarter
results, meeting revised expectations.

By Mike Trigg

VA Linux (Nasdaq: LNUX), which makes software and computers
using the Linux operating system, reported its first-quarter
outcome after the market's close yesterday, in-line with revised
estimates. It was less than two weeks ago when the Freemont,
California-based company warned results would fall short of
expectations, citing slow sales growth from dot-com customers.
The market reacted harshly from that news with shares plummeting
42% in one day.

Excluding non-cash items, VA Linux's fiscal first-quarter (ended
October 27) net loss was $7 million, or $0.15 per share,
compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.27 per share, in
the year-ago period. The Street had expected a loss of $0.09 per
share prior to the warning. On the top line, the open-source
software provider reported $56.1 million in revenues, compared
to $14.8 million in the same period last year.

"While top and bottom-line results did not meet our expectations
for the quarter, we remain optimistic about our prospects for
growth in the future. We remain committed to profitability,
excluding non-cash charges, no later than the end of calendar
2001, and we anticipate revenue for fiscal 2001 to be
approximately 2.25 times fiscal 2000 revenue,'' said President
and CEO Dr. Larry M. Augustin.

VA Linux's stock, which closed last night at $12, is down
significantly from its 52-week high of $320. Clearly, the days
of unabashed enthusiasm for Linux stocks are gone. However,
investors continue to keep companies like VA Linux on the radar,
and being profitable one year from now would help the company's
prospects.

Management's ability to control costs while growing revenues is
critical. The other key to success will be monitoring the
commercial acceptance of Linux-based products, particularly
among Fortune 1000 companies. The fact remains that Linux
products are still something that appeal more to techies, and
until that changes investors will continue to have doubts about
VA Linux's ability to succeed

NEWS TO GO

Caffeine haven Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) announced fourth-quarter
earnings after the market's close yesterday. The company
(excluding non-cash items) reported income of $43.8 million, or
$0.22 per share, compared to $32.4 million, or $0.17 per share,
a year ago. That's a 35% increase. The Street consensus called
for the company to earn $0.22 per share. Revenues for the
quarter were $582 million, compared to $475 million a year ago.
Including non-cash charges to write down Internet investments,
Starbucks' profit was $0.01 per share. Same-sales stores grew
10%.

Southeastern U.S. local-phone company BellSouth Corp. (NYSE:
BLS) announced it expects earnings per share to grow between 7%
and 9% next year. The company previously forecasted 13% to 15%
growth. According to a spokesperson, the new estimate includes
the cost of entering Colombia and adding more customers for
digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet access, which was not
factored into the original forecast. BellSouth expects customers
for DSL service to expand threefold to 600,000 next year,
reducing earnings by $0.07 per share. Colombian acquisitions are
expected to cut earnings another $0.06 per share for the year.

Computer networking chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (Nasdaq:
MRVL) reported third-quarter results after the market's close
last night, exceeding Street expectations. Marvell's net income
was $1.8 million, or $0.02 per share. Excluding stock
compensation costs, profit was $3.4 million, or $0.04 per share,
compared to $5.5 million, or $0.07 per share, a year ago,
exceeding Street expectations by a penny. Revenue came in at
$36.2 million, a 54% year-over-year increase.

Semiconductor company Dallas Semiconductor (NYSE: DS) announced
that Chairman, CEO, and President Vin Prothro died yesterday
after suffering a heart attack. Prothro founded the company in
1984 and had served in his current duties since its inception.
The company announced its board would meet soon to start the
process of naming a successor. The 58-year-old Prothro had no
history of heart problems. Before trading was halted, Dallas
Semiconductor shares dropped $1.19 to $36.88.

"I wasn't affected by the crash of '29. I went broke in '28."
-- Gerald Lieberman

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PORTAL SOFTWARE'S Q1 SLUMP
Communications customer management and billing software company
Portal Software (Nasdaq: PRSF) today pre-announced fiscal
first-quarter (ended April 30) financial results, the company
pointing investors toward revenue&nbsp;of between
$42&nbsp;million&nbsp;and $44 million and pro forma losses
of&nbsp;$0.19 to $0.21 per share. Wall Street was looking for a
net profit of&nbsp;a penny per share.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=404418

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Online retailer Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been
"dramatically" scaling back the engineering and business
development resources devoted to its "Amazon Anywhere" mobile
commerce unit, according to The Wall Street Journal, despite
broad proclamations about the growth potential of wireless
commerce.

Optical network operator Qwest Communications (NYSE: Q)
announced four contracts for broadband Internet communications
services worth "more than $30 million."

Networking equipment giant Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) will provide
China Telecom with more than 500 high-speed routers over the
next year as the Chinese company works to establish a network
that spans the country. The equipment will be used in ChinaNet,
China Telecom's Internet service provider. Financial terms were
not disclosed.

Retailer Kmart's (NYSE: KM) BlueLight.com Internet service
operation agreed to an expanded service pact with broadband
carrier Level 3 Communications (Nasdaq: LVLT). Bluelight.com is
part-owned by Softbank, an investor in The Motley Fool, and
Martha Stewart Omnimedia (NYSE: MSO), the latter covered in Fool
News & Commentary last week.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=404419

Drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: WPI) said first-quarter
profits from operations were $0.40 per share, up from $0.37 last
year and in-line with market expectations. The company pointed
investors toward full-year profits of $2.23 to $2.25 per share.
Wall Street is currently looking for $2.26.

COKE MAY BE SOWING OATS
Coke makes $16 billion bid for Quaker Oats and its Gatorade
brand.

By Tom Jacobs

Reuters reports that soft drink giant Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO)
has offered $16 billion for Quaker Oats Co. (NYSE: OAT), eyeing
its powerful Gatorade brand sports drink. Coke's offer tops
PepsiCo's (NYSE: PEP) $14.8 billion proposed purchase, which
Quaker rebuffed earlier this month.

Coke is believed to be offering 1.9 shares per Quaker share, or
about $116.70. France's Groupe Danone (NYSE: DA) has reportedly
made an offer as well, and the Quaker board is probably prepared
to hear from PepsiCo again -- or even another possible suitor,
such as Nestle.

Coke is currently trying to regain investor confidence after
shaky times. The deal would give Coke a lock on the sport drink
market, which Quaker's Gatorade currently dominates with an 84%
market share, compared to 11% held by Coke's PowerAde and 3.1%
for PepsiCo's All-Sport. Industry analysts note that the
non-carbonated beverage market is growing faster than the bubbly
kind, and Gatorade is the solid-gold brand. The appeal of the
Gatorade label explains why other suitors may appear once they
know Gatorade's in play. But any buyer would have to deal with
Quaker's cereal business, and there's only so much you can do
with oats after you toast them or sugar them up in breakfast
bars.

Any deal for Quaker would join a gaggle of recent food world
acquisitions: Philip Morris (NYSE: MO) purchased Nabisco
Holdings (NYSE: NGH) in June; Unilever -- Anglo-Dutch parent of
Unilever PLC (NYSE: UL) and Unilever N.V. (NYSE: UN) -- acquired
Bestfoods Oct. 5; and Keebler Foods Co. (NYSE: KBL) combined with
Kellogg Co. (NYSE: K) on Oct. 26.

Coke closed Friday at $61.83, down $0.50, while Quaker finished
off $0.19 to $90.31, just shy of its 52-week high of $92. Quaker
has jumped 13% since its suitors appeared, while Coke stock
currently sells for 1997 prices.

NEWS TO GO

Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A) is selling its medical products
business to Dutch electronics whiz Philips Electronics for $1.7
billion, capping Philips' two-year, $4 billion buying spree in
the industry. The deal leaves Philips the number three medical
equipment maker, behind General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Siemens.
This is an interesting move for Agilent, which apparently views
its dragging medical equipment business separately from its
booming life science manufacturing biz, growing through
partnerships with such biotechs as Caliper Technologies (Nasdaq:
CALP) and Rosetta Inpharmatics (Nasdaq: RSTA).

Programmable logic company Xilinx (Nasdaq: XLNX) won its
seven-year-old patent infringement suit Friday against
competitor Altera (Nasdaq: ALTR) and said it would seek an
immediate injunction against the loser. Back atcha, Altera
promised an immediate appeal of the jury verdict. Altera sought
to minimize the damage, asserting that the verdict covers only
Flex 8000 product sales, representing just 2%, or $30 million,
of its annual revenues. Xilinx is a favorite of telecom guru
George Gilder.

Alas, still darker days for Sunbeam (NYSE: SOC). The Securities
and Exchange Commission has recommended enforcement action
against the company and individual officers -- including former
Chairman and CEO "Chainsaw" Al Dunlap -- for alleged accounting
irregularities that created a sunny picture of actual cloudy
days for the camping goods and appliance manufacturer. Sunbeam
limped home Friday to $0.68.

Online auto dealer Autoweb.com (Nasdaq: AWEB) is laying off 25%
of its staff in an effort to save $10 million a year and become
profitable. The company's difficulty in attracting buyers to
online car showrooms joins priceline.com's (Nasdaq: PCLN)
similar woes. Autoweb's chart since its March 1999 IPO is an
emblem for the dot-com debacle. The company squeaked home to
$0.53 on Friday, a true penny stock.

"To succeed in business, it is necessary to make others see
things as you see them." -- John H. Patterson


GENERAL ELECTRIC TO PURCHASE HONEYWELL
General Electric announced plans to buy Honeywell for nearly
$48.4 billion in stock and debt.

By Mike Trigg

Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric (NYSE: GE) announced
plans to purchase aerospace systems company Honeywell (NYSE:
HON) for nearly $48.4 billion in stock and debt, GE's biggest
deal ever. In addition, General Electric Chairman and CEO Jack
Welch agreed to stay on through next year in order to see the
acquisition through.

Under terms of the agreement, General Electric will pay 1.005
shares for the automated controls maker, or about $55.12 per
share based on Honeywell's closing price Friday. The equity and
debt mix is about $45 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
According to General Electric, the deal will add at least $0.10
per share in its first full year and is being accounted for as a
pooling of interest.

After planning to step down as chairman in April, it's a bonus
Welch will be staying on to supervise the transition, calming
Street concerns. He's been on the job for over two decades,
overseeing tremendous company success, and is considered a
top-notch corporate executive. The company still plans on going
through with earlier plans to name a successor, expected
sometime before the year's end. In European trading, General
Electric was up, while Honeywell traded down.

The announcement comes only days after aerospace parts company
United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) and Honeywell were in similar
talks for a deal reportedly worth $40 billion. It would have
created an aerospace parts company with over $48 billion in
annual sales based on last fiscal year's figures. According to
reports, United Technologies stepped away from the table,
unwilling to engage in a bidding war after learning General
Electric had entered the picture.

Likewise, this deal comes less than a year after AlligedSignal
bought Honeywell and became Honeywell International. Of course,
integration is always a concern with any acquisition, and this
one will have its fair share of changes, with surely more to
come. According to a Honeywell spokesperson, its headquarters in
Morristown, N.J. will be closed and about 500 employees will
potentially lose their jobs. Three Honeywell officials will be
added to GE's board, including CEO Michael Bonsignore.

Overall, the acquisition creates an industrial Goliath that
specializes in aerospace, chemicals, and plastics products and
systems, among others. According to Welch, Honeywell's core
businesses -- avionics, automated controls, performance
materials, and microturbine technology -- are a perfect fit with
four of General Electric's major business lines.

NEWS TO GO

Optical networking company Corning (NYSE: GLW) announced fiscal
third-quarter results this morning with profits more than
doubling. The company cited increased demand for optical fiber
and components used in communication networks. Corning reported
pro forma earnings of $317 million, or $0.35 per share, compared
to $148.1 million, or $0.17 per share, in the year-ago period.
The announcement was in line with the company's recently raised
forecast of $0.34 to $0.35 per share, with the Street consensus
calling for $0.34 per share. Revenues came in at $1.9 billion, a
54% increase from the year-ago figure of $1.25 billion.

Over the weekend, Lucent Technologies' (NYSE: LU) board of
directors named Henry Schacht the company's new chairman and
CEO. According to a press release, a need for a new set of
skills at this point in the company's life was the reason for
replacing existing Chairman and CEO Richard McGinn. Schacht is
returning to a position he held from 1995 to 1997. He will work
with senior management to run day-to-day operations and will
begin a search for his successor. The change could not come at a
better time, as Bill man recently commented. After yet another
earnings warning earlier this month, Lucent shareholders were
calling for the McGinn's removal. Hooray for them, I suppose.

According to The Wall Street Journal, AT&T (NYSE: T) is
contemplating a plan, "Project Grand Slam", that would split the
company into four businesses: consumer long distance, wireless,
business, and broadband. The Business Services division, its
largest and most profitable, would become the new AT&T. It would
create brand and licensing arrangements with the three other
businesses. That division generated 39% of the company's total
1999 revenue, or $25 billion. The proposal will be discussed at
the telecommunication provider's board meeting Monday and, if
approved, could be announced as soon as Wednesday.

ANALOG DEVICES' STRONG Q4
Circuit maker Analog Devices reported estimate-beating Q4
results yesterday.

By LouAnn Lofton

Integrated circuit maker Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) reported
fourth-quarter and fiscal year-end results yesterday after the
bell. The company earned $0.54 a share in the fourth quarter,
ahead of the First Call/Thompson Financial consensus estimate by
$0.04. In last year's fourth quarter, Analog Devices earned
$0.20.

Sales for the quarter were up 87% to $806 million from $431
million in the year-ago period. Net income increased to $206.5
million, compared to $73.2 million last year. The company's
gross margin improved during the quarter to 58.6% from 52.2%.

For the fiscal year, Analog Devices earned $588.8 million on
sales of $2.58 billion. In the previous fiscal year, the
company's sales were $1.45 billion, and its net income was
$204.8 million. On a per-share basis, Analog Devices earned
$1.54 a share in fiscal 2000, versus $0.57 in fiscal 1999.

The company also announced yesterday that it will be
repurchasing up to 15 million shares of its common stock.
Currently, there are about 356 million shares of Analog Devices
common stock outstanding. The shares are being bought back for
use in the company's stock option plans, as well as other
employee stock-based benefit plans.

Looking ahead to the first quarter of its new fiscal year,
Analog Devices expects 7-10% sequential revenue growth. The
company sees first-quarter earnings per share to come in between
$0.58 and $0.60 a share. The current consensus estimate for
Analog Devices' first quarter is $0.54. The company says it
believes its revenue growth will be constrained by supply, not
demand.

Analog Devices' President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman said, "Our
first look for the entire year of fiscal 2001 is also very
encouraging. We currently believe that fiscal 2001's revenues
could exceed fiscal 2000's by more than 50%, which would result
in fiscal 2001 revenues of more than $3.8 billion."
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

In an SEC filing yesterday, it was disclosed that the man who
has for so long believed in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also apparently
believes at least a little in Pepsi (NYSE: PEP). Warren
Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) has acquired
about a 1% stake in Tricon Global Restaurants (NYSE: YUM), the
Pepsi spin-off that includes fast-food restaurants Pizza Hut,
Taco Bell, and KFC. Close to 98% of those restaurants serve
Pepsi products. Buffett owns 8.1% of Coca-Cola and is also a
director for the company.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) said yesterday that it will allow
customers ordering new 2001 Explorers to elect to have Goodyear
tires on their vehicles over the standard Firestones. This move
formally allows customers to have the new Explorers delivered
with Goodyear tires, as opposed to switching off the Firestones
for the Goodyears before the purchase. It's estimated that
between 5-10% of Explorer customers have been asking dealers to
change the tires on their new trucks before driving them off of
the lot, thanks to the Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires. In
states where the tire problems were the worst, up to 40% of
customers have been asking for the switch.

E-commerce software company BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) reported
third-quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company's
pro forma net income was $31.3 million, or $0.07 a share. Last
year, the company's pro forma net income was $10.4 million, or
$0.03 a share. BEA beat the consensus estimate according to
First Call/Thompson Financial by a penny. Revenues grew 77% to
$244 million, from last year's $126.5 million.

Optical networking company Sycamore Networks (Nasdaq: SCMR)
announced fiscal first-quarter results after the market's close
yesterday. Sycamore's pro forma net income was $6 million, or
$0.02 a diluted share, for the quarter. Last year, it lost $4.1
million, or $0.02 a share, in the first quarter. The company
earned a penny more than analysts had expected. Revenues grew by
517% to $120.4 million, compared to the year-ago period's $19.5
million.

SCHERING FIGHTING FDA PANEL, MERGER RUMORS
It will no doubt be a busy day for investors following
drugmaking Rule Maker Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP), as the
company was thrust into the news for several reasons. First
among them: On Friday, an advisory panel recommended to the FDA
that Schering's Claritin allergy drug -- and similar offerings
from other companies, including Aventis (NYSE: AVE) and Pfizer
(NYSE: PFE), which make for a multibillion-dollar business --
should be cleared for over-the-counter, non-prescription sale.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Canadian networking equipment company Nortel (NYSE: NT) will
lose CEO John Roth to retirement next year. Likely successor and
COO Clarence Chandran, meanwhile, is quitting for medical
reasons, and so Roth will stick around to lead the search for
his replacement.

SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI) surprised investors by making a $14.7
billion bid for Wachovia (NYSE: WB), which is already betrothed
to First Union (NYSE: FTU). SunTrust's offer is 17% more than
First Union's based on Friday's closing prices for the competing
stock swap bids. For more on the First Union deal, read Brian
Graney's mid-April article.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408425

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A), Warren Buffett's insurance and
investing conglomerate, said first-quarter net earnings per
share were $397, down from $531 last year. Operating earnings,
meanwhile, improved to $462 million from $354 million. The
company's report can be viewed at its website.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=408426

Telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE: T) reportedly said in an
SEC filing that it will saddle its broadband business unit with
more debt than any of its other units, or approximately $28.4
billion, when it splits into four separate companies later this
year. For more on the company's current exchange offer of shares
of AT&T Wireless (NYSE: AWE), check out Bill Mann's column of
last week.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=408427

Pizza mover Papa John's (Nasdaq: PZZA) said April comparable
sales fell 5.3% even as total revenues rose 27%. Last year
comparables rose 7.3%. The company said some of the difference
can be attributed to its anniversary promotion, which ran in Q2
last year but Q1 this time around.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

KRISPY KREME HOPES TO KEEP DUNKING
What kind of visibility is there in looking through donut holes?
Quite a bit, apparently, as Krispy Kreme (Nasdaq: KREM) today
issued guidance through the end of fiscal 2003 even as it
reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2002
(ended April 29).

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=409791

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Preppy apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) said
fiscal Q1 (ended May 5) EPS rose to $0.20, up from $0.16 last
year and three pennies better than Wall Street's consensus. The
company pointed investors toward EPS of $0.22 for Q2, in-line
with current projections.

Gallium arsenide telecommunications chip maker TriQuint
Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TQNT) agreed to buy wireless
communications components company Sawtek (Nasdaq: SAWS) with
stock valued, as of last night's close, at $1.29 billion.
TriQuint's $29.92 per-share offer was a 15% premium over last
night's close for Sawtek.

Sporting equipment company Rawlings (Nasdaq: RAWL) sold its Vic
Hockey division to Vic Hockey Co. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed. "We now look forward to focusing our energy on
building our core brand equity," said Chairman and CEO Steve
O'Hara.

Leading jewelry retailer Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) said fiscal Q1
(ended April 30) net income rose slightly though EPS was flat,
year-over-year, at $0.20. That was a penny better than expected
by Wall Street. Revenues fell 2.5% to $336.4 million. While U.S.
and international retail sales fell year-over-year, direct
marketing revenues actually improved, though the base upon which
they grew was relatively small at less than 10% of total sales.

Middleware software vendor BEA Systems (Nasdaq: BEAS) turned in
fiscal Q1 (ended April 30) EPS of $0.05, up from last year's
$0.03 per-share loss. That figure included acquisition-related
costs, without which BEA came in a penny ahead of the Street's
$0.07 per-share estimate. The company also boosted its full-year
EPS guidance to $0.43 from $0.41.

IN THIS ISSUE:

Q&A: What exactly are "tech stocks"?
Q&A: Are Insider Stock Sales a Red Flag?
LESSON: Confronting Contradictory Advice


YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

-- Q. What exactly are "tech stocks" -- computer makers?

-- A. Great question. The term often refers to computer
companies and software makers. But these days, it can be hard to
think of companies that don't employ a fair amount of
technology.

Think of pharmaceutical firms, for instance. Drug chemistry and
drug delivery processes involve technology. Golf club
manufacturers apply technology to their new product development.
Pretty much any airplane-related enterprise uses technology
-- from building jets to booking flights. Likewise, Federal
Express and other delivery specialists rely heavily on
technology. Of course, some companies do so more than others.
Sun Microsystems, for example, is much more of a technology
company than Hershey.

When we hear that "tech stocks were up today," we have to wonder
what exactly is being said. A good way to think about the term
might be to use it for companies that draw most of their revenue
from directly using or creating technology.

-- Q. How bad a sign is it if a company's insiders are selling
shares?

-- A. It's not necessarily bad at all. Many executives these
days are compensated significantly with stock options. They may
simply be generating cash to buy a house or put a kid through
college. We wouldn't fret too much unless an awful lot of a
company's top brass were selling shares -- and selling
significant percentages of their holdings. Even that could be a
coincidence, but it might warrant a little scrutiny on your
part.

LESSON: CONFRONTING CONTRADICTORY ADVICE

Learning to invest successfully isn't a straightforward
endeavor. You'll frequently run across seemingly contradictory
advice, which will leave you scratching your head. The solution
to this confusion is to understand that investing is both 1.
simple and 2. complex.

At the beginning, it's simple. Your first steps should be to get
out of debt, read broadly on investing, and perhaps invest your
initial dollars in an index fund. But once you begin looking
into picking individual stocks on your own, you may run into
some contradictions. For example:

1. Don't waste your time trying to time the market. Always
   remain invested in stocks. And
2. Don't be afraid to stay out of the market, at least
   partially, for a while. Wait for the fat pitches.

Here's another pair:

1. Don't add money to a falling stock position. And
2. Dollar-cost average, investing regularly in a stock no matter
   whether it's up or down.

There are many such dilemmas that frustrate new investors.

1. Buy and hold forever (or at least for a very long time).
2. Sell when something much better comes along.

And

1. Let your winners run.
2. Rebalance your portfolio when one or more stocks come to
   dominate it in a big way.

There are some points on which most Fools will agree (penny
stocks are bad, technical analysis is dubious), but many points
on which we differ a little. Furthermore, scratch the surface of
a Fool and you'll likely find that many of us are a little
contradictory even within our own attitudes. That's fine. It
just means we're complex, and that investing can also be
complex. In some situations, buying and holding for decades
might work well. In others, it might make sense to sell when
something much more promising comes along.

If you're a good Foolish investor, you're always questioning,
examining, thinking and rethinking. You're continually changing
your perceptions of investing, perhaps after making some
regrettable moves and pondering how they came to pass.

1. Life is simple: Eat, drink, breathe, sleep.
2. Life is complicated: Prepare a tax return, study physics,
   raise children.

Wherever you go, even in investing, there are always
contradictions. But that's okay.

"They seek to change others because they cannot change

BUFFETT'S BERKSHIRE BAGS BETTER Q3
Holding company Berkshire Hathaway bests last year and moves
farther into household names.

By Tom Jacobs

Holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) announced Q3
earnings Friday of $523 per Class A share, 90% over last year's
$276. While earnings from operations jumped from last year's
$103 to $197, Berkshire also reaped substantial investment
gains. Class A shares closed Friday unchanged at $62,200, while
the Class B shares (non-voting shares worth 1/30th of each Class
A) for the commoners finished up $11 at $2043.

Warren Buffett and Charles Munger steer Berkshire, whose wholly
owned businesses include insurance, aviation, newspaper, candy,
shoe, jewelry, and home furnishing companies. Berkshire also
maintains large stock holdings in energy and name-brand U.S.
stocks, such as Gillette (NYSE: G) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).
Because of Berkshire's holdings and insurance business, not many
analysts follow the company -- The Motley Fool has one -- and
the quarterly numbers are not as simple as they seem. For one
thing, Berkshire's numbers vary considerably quarter-to-quarter,
and much of the insurance business action occurs in the fourth
quarter.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=191757
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=191758

A big factor for an insurance business is float -- money paid in
premiums that the insurer invests in hopes of a greater gain
against future payout for claims. Berkshire's float increased by
a healthy $1.3 billion in Q3. But underwriting losses at its
General Re unit -- which have plagued Berkshire in the last
several years --continued, with another $135 million loss on a
contract there. However, Buffett believes that the loss will
mean future investment benefits, stating, "From time to time we
will have such transactions in the future and we will post you
of their effects upon our current earnings. When priced
properly, this pain-today, gain-tomorrow business is welcomed by
us and benefits our shareholders." I'm one of those, and you
gotta love words like that from a CEO.

Buffett observed that advertising spent for Berkshire's GEICO
insurance unit has not realized more than a nominal gain in
policyholders. GEICO plans to cut back advertising for now, and
Buffett believes that increased rates will lead to some
improvement in profitability next year.

The quarter saw more Berkshire moves into home furnishings, with
proposed purchases of Shaw Industries (NYSE: SHX) and Benjamin
Moore Paint. Berkshire shareholders tend to be rabid about their
company and are already debating the numbers.

NEWS TO GO

Fresh pork and processed meat producer and marketer Smithfield
Foods (NYSE: SFD) offered to acquire all outstanding stock of
No. 1 U.S. beef producer IBP (NYSE: IBP). The other white meat
maker would pay $4.1 billion in stock and assumed debt for
what's for dinner. This means Smithfield pays $25 per IBP share,
20% above IBP's Friday close of $20.88.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers meets
this week in Marina del Rey, California, with its 800 members
leading up to adding as many as 14 new domain names to join
existing Internet suffixes .org, .com, .net, .edu, and .gov. New
names would mean competition for VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) ) whose
Network Solutions purchase gave it control over the database for
.com, .org, and .net. -- with full pricing and registration
power. ICANN received 44 complete applications at $50,000 a
crack. Some names reported include .web, .biz, .ecom, and .info
for general topics; .nom, .per, and .i for personal home pages;
and .health, .museum, and .union for specific content. (And
.tom9 for -- just kidding!) ICANN has taken some heat for
rejecting .kids and .xxx for porn sites, but ICANN staff held
firm, saying that defining kids' sites would be problematic, and
that porn sites couldn't be forced to take an .xxx suffix. The
board's 19 members will act Thursday and it's reported that the
new domains will be operational in Q2 2001.

Netpliance (Nasdaq: NPLI) announced Sunday it would cut 38% of
its workforce and refocus its business away from its
poor-selling I-Opener Internet appliance, which combined the
device with Internet access and Netpliance's consumer portal.
Netpliance reported Friday a $41.9 million loss, or $0.69 per
share, versus a loss of $6.5 million, or $0.20 per share, a year
ago. The company intends to reorganize into two business units:
Netpliance.net, offering next-generation services and hosted
applications to broadband service providers, and Netpliance IPG,
which will develop core infrastructure products to be installed
in data centers, points-of-presence, and residential access
devices. Though the company had $76.6 million in cash at the end
of the September quarter, it's hard to see how it can expect to
make headway in this area already filled with cash-rich competitors.

A federal court in Delaware has ruled against GeneChip DNA array
maker Affymetrix (Nasdaq: AFFX) in favor of the U.K.'s Oxford
Gene Technology in a patent infringement case involving
technology fundamental to Affymetrix's product technology. Two
weeks ago a British appeals court ruled in favor of Affymetrix
that it had a license when it purchased part of Beckman Coulter
(NYSE: BEC) in 1999. According to reports, the U.S. court agreed
with the British court on the Beckman Coulter-Affymetrix license
transfer, so the sole issue is a 17-month period when Affymetrix
paid no royalties to Oxford. Oxford sought $40 million -- which
will not be tripled because the court reportedly found that
Affymetrix did not willfully or knowingly infringe the patents.
Affymetrix expects about $190 million in revenues from its
GeneChip arrays and related equipment this year. CEO Stephen
Fodor stated that "We don't think [the decision] will have a
long-term effect. Our future is secure. So we're now talking
about the past -- of about 17 months at the most and no trebling
of damages.''

Reuters reports that chip giant Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) will
announce two new Celeron processors chips, running at 733
megahertz and 766 megahertz, to further its hold on the
sub-$1,000 PC market in the face of stiffening competition from
Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD). AMD currently has the
speediest chip on the market and is said to be undercutting
Intel on price by 25%. The 766 will cost $170 per thousand and
the 733 will cost $112 per thousand, giving you a pretty good
idea of where the prices are in a low-cost PC box. Intel said
that Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) will
introduce systems using the chips.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

"GAME ON" FOR ACTIVISION
Video game software publisher Activision (Nasdaq: ATVI)
announced better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter (ended
March 31) results after the market's close yesterday and raised
its full-year guidance. The company earned $0.03 per share,
beating Wall Street's estimate by two cents. Meanwhile, revenues
increased 22% over the year-ago period to $127 million.

>>FULL STORY:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fiber optic telecom firm Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) beat Wall
Street's first-quarter expectations after the market's close
yesterday, though its loss nearly doubled from the previous
year. The company posted a loss of $675.4 million, or $0.76 per
share, compared to a loss of $348.1 million, or $0.45 per share,
in the year-ago period. That was well ahead of Wall Street's
estimate for a loss of $0.88 per share. Revenue grew to $1.1
billion from $906.6 million year-over-year.

Network storage firm EMC (NYSE: EMC) announced plans to
repurchase 50 million shares of stock. With 2.2 billion shares
outstanding, the repurchase translates to about 2.2% of the
total float. According to the company's press release, stock
purchased under the program will be available for various
purposes, including employee stock option and employee stock
purchase plans. The company said the news indicates the shares
are a good investment.

Holding company Internet Capital Group (Nasdaq: ICGE) posted a
pro forma net loss of $185 million, or $0.66 per share, compared
to a net loss of $35 million, or $0.13 per share, in the
year-ago period. The company cut 30 jobs in the quarter and will
slice another 15 next month. Moreover, Internet Capital Group
took a $1.2 billion charge because the value of its holdings has
plummeted. For example, ICGE saw a $700 million drop in
privately held software vendor Rightworks, which was recently
acquired by to i2 Technologies (Nasdaq: ITWO).

Bar code maker Brady (NYSE: BRC) said yesterday it expects
third-quarter earnings between $0.42 and $0.45 per share, well
below the $0.51 per share it posted in the year-ago period. Wall
Street's estimate calls for earnings of $0.49 per share. The
company expects sales of $134 million, versus $142.5 million in
the year-ago period. Brady also expects 2001 sales of $535
million to $550 million and earnings of $1.60 to $1.75 per
share.

CHEVRON GUZZLES TEXACO
Two U.S. oil powers agreed this weekend to form the world's
fourth-largest oil and gas company.

By Tom Jacobs

The Texaco (NYSE: TX) board yesterday approved Chevron's (NYSE:
CHV) $35.1 billion stock purchase offer. The deal between the
No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. oil companies would create the
fourth-largest world oil and gas concern, Chevron Texaco, and
increase competition for world leader Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM).

Chevron will pay 0.77 of a share for each Texaco share and
assume $8 billion in debt, for a total of $45.4 billion. The
per-share price -- slightly higher than the 0.765 that Chevron
offered in 1999 talks that stalled -- values Texaco at $64.87,
an 18% premium to its Friday close of $55.13. Chevron
shareholders will have 61% control of Chevron Texaco and nine of
the 15 board seats.

Attention immediately focused on regulatory and political
obstacles to the marriage. The new company would have major
control of West Coast refining capacity and gas stations. Middle
East upheavals could bring political scrutiny as well. But the
new company's $85 billion market capitalization appears puny
compared to BP Amoco's (NYSE: BP) $207 billion, and the smaller
Chevron Texaco would arguably pose less of a threat to world gas
prices.

Texaco abruptly broke off prior merger talks in June 1999,
allegedly due to bad chemistry between former Chevron CEO
Kenneth Derr and Texaco Chairman Peter Bijur. Derr has since
retired. The new CEO, David O'Reilly, assumed command nine
months ago and reportedly has good relations with Bijur,
including several golf dates. Reilly would be CEO of the new
combined entity and Bijur would stay on as number two.

The deal came just days after Texaco purchased General Motors'
(NYSE: GM) interest in GM Ovonic, a joint venture between GM and
Ovonic Battery Company, a subsidiary of Energy Conversion
Devices (Nasdaq: ENER). Ovonic Battery was the originator of
nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries for electric and hybrid
vehicles. The joint venture develops production and
manufacturing processes to commercialize the NiMH battery
technology for use in 2003 model year cars. Texaco's share of
the joint venture is 50%, adding to its 20% ownership of Energy
Conversion Devices. There is no information whether the Chevron
purchase will affect this deal.

All told, the deal looks good for Texaco. Though both companies'
revenues are approximately $36 billion, Texaco's profits are 60%
of Chevron's. On Friday's huge up day, Texaco closed at $55.13,
off $1.88, while Chevron shed $3.06 to finish at $84.25.

NEWS TO GO

European regulators switched course Friday and approved
Vivendi's (NYSE: V) $34 billion acquisition of Canada's Seagram
(NYSE: VO), after the European Commission indicated it might
subject the deal to a time-consuming further investigation. The
key shift occurred when Vivendi agreed not to discriminate
against competitors seeking access to Seagram's Universal unit's
film and music libraries. Observers are surprised that this deal
practically flew by in comparison with the five-month probe of
the Time Warner (NYSE: TWX)-America Online (NYSE: AOL) deal.

Qualcomm's (Nasdaq: QCOM) on-again, off-again affair with China
Unicom over increased Chinese penetration of Qualcomm's CDMA
(code division multiple access) wireless technology is back on.
The companies announced that they will join Shenzhen Zhongxing
Telecom, the leading Chinese CDMA phone equipment manufacturer,
to produce a CDMA handset for sale in China. A cool feature is
that it allows users to remove subscriber identification module
cards and switch phones, and retain their number and service.
Would be a good idea for the U.S., wouldn't it? Dream on.

Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) announced today third-quarter
earnings of $2.24 a share, a 54% jump over last year. This
exceeded First Call consensus estimates of $2.19 a share (click
here for a Foolish take on earnings estimates). The company
trumpeted its 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Passenger
revenue increased in every geographic market, ranging from 12.2%
domestically and 27.9% for transatlantic traffic.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=155936

Continental may be smiling, but Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL)
isn't. Its pilots' contract proposal seeks huge pay increases
and parity with pilots for United Airlines (NYSE: UAL). The
pilots agreed in 1996 to a 2% pay cut and other work concessions
to assist Delta's turnaround. They now want 30-49% raises over
three years, which would bring basic pay for a 777 captain with
12 years experience to $267,600. (Would we feel safer?) Gregg
Holm, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, called
this "United [Airlines] plus."

BANK OF AMERICA TIGHTENS CREDIT
The company also issued a fourth-quarter profit warning
yesterday.

By Chris Rugaber

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) lowered its earnings guidance for
the fourth quarter yesterday, due to increased write-offs of bad
loans. The company also announced that it would not renew $20
billion in corporate loans over the next two years. It is the
second time in the past month that the company has reduced its
fourth-quarter profit projections.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank now expects
fourth-quarter profits of about $1.4 billion, or $0.85 to $0.90
per share, down from last year's $1.23 per share and below
estimates of $1.17. As recently as September, estimates for the
fourth quarter were $1.35 per share. Earnings projections were
also reduced for next year, from $5.46 to $5.10 per share. The
company plans to write off between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion
in bad debt this quarter, almost triple the third quarter's
total of $435 million. Bank of America's shares fell about 10%
yesterday, and other bank stocks declined as well, including
Citigroup (NYSE: C), Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB), First Union
(NYSE: FTU), and Bank One (NYSE: ONE).

Last month, the company indicated that a loan of $500 million --
widely believed to be held by the Sunbeam Corporation (NYSE:
SOC) -- is "nonperforming," meaning it is not paying interest.
In addition, Bank of America holds loans to companies such as
Owens Corning (NYSE: OWC), which filed for bankruptcy October 5
as a result of asbestos litigation, and ICG Communications
(Nasdaq: ICGXQ), which filed for bankruptcy on November 14. The
company also lent to Regal Cinemas, which defaulted on its bank
debt last month and is considering filing for bankruptcy.

Bank of America seems to have a negative outlook at this point.
"We're pessimistic about the economy, we're pessimistic about
the capital markets and the ability of companies to refinance,
and it's very easy for companies to throw in the towel,'' said
Chief Financial Officer James Hance at an investors' conference
yesterday. "We're taking a very conservative outlook.''

Part of that conservative outlook was announced later yesterday
when the company said it would not renew about $20 billion in
loans over the next two years. CFO Hance noted that "We are not
interested in renting out our balance sheet to clients who are
not delivering us additional fee-based business." The move comes
after Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan urged banks on
Tuesday not to overly tighten their credit standards.

NEWS TO GO

Motorola (NYSE: MOT) greeted investors this morning with an
earnings warning, stating that it will not meet earlier revenue
and earnings guidance. The company blamed delays in cost-cutting
measures in its personal communications segment and "slowing
market conditions" for its semiconductor products. Motorola now
expects fourth-quarter sales of $10 billion and earnings per
share of $0.15, down from earlier guidance of $10.5 billion and
$0.27, respectively. In a press release the company stated that
it "continues to expect robust growth in the global wireless
telephone market, with unit sales in the range of 525-575
million in 2001, up from an estimated 420 million units this
year, and expects to fully participate in that growth." The
company announced additional manufacturing outsourcing
yesterday.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=232133

Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) may soon be a has-been (sorry). The company
warned last night that it will at best break even this year, and
may post a loss of $0.10 to $0.20 per share, thanks to slowing
sales, particularly in trading-card games. Hasbro also said it
will sell its Hasbro Interactive and Games.com divisions to
French company Infogrames Entertainment for $100 million in cash
and stock. The company was expected to earn $0.43 per share this
year, and pulled in $1.42 per share last year.

Internet-commerce consultant Scient (Nasdaq: SCNT) announced
last night that its fiscal third-quarter earnings would come in
below expectations, and that it would cut 460 jobs. The company
cited slowing spending among its clients -- which included AT&T
(NYSE: T) and Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB) -- on Web services and
growing competition from management consulting firms as the culprits.

The world's fifth-largest media company, News Corp. (NYSE: NWS),
said that it has initiated a hiring freeze in order to control
costs as advertising revenue growth slows. President Peter
Chernin said he expects the U.S. ad market to be "tough" over
the next couple of quarters. Yesterday, other news organizations
such as Dow Jones Inc. (NYSE: DJ) and Knight-Ridder (NYSE: KRI)
also cited slowing ad sales as a reason behind their negative
announcements. Dow Jones reduced earnings projections for its
fourth quarter, while Knight Ridder said it would lay off as
much as 2% of its workforce.

SHELL INKS $4.05 BILLION CHINA DEAL
After 12 years of talks, Shell and China National Offshore Oil
Corp. agreed to the largest Sino-foreign pact yet.

By Tom Jacobs

Patience is a virtue -- especially for foreign businesses in
China. According to Reuters, Shell Chemicals topped off 12 years
of negotiations with China National Offshore Oil Corp. by
signing a $4.05 billion petrochemical contract over the weekend.
The Chinese Xinhua news agency heralded the deal as the largest
joint venture yet between China and a foreign partner. Shell is
majority-owned by Netherlands-based energy powerhouse Royal
Dutch Petroleum (NYSE: RD), now facing increased worldwide
competition from the proposed merger between Chevron (NYSE: CHV)
and Texaco (NYSE: TX).

The companies will build a petrochemical complex in the southern
city of Huizhou, Guangdong province, which will at first produce
ethylene and petrochemical products. Reuters reports Xinhua's
assertion that the new project brings technology for China to
make low-end chemical products. The $4.05 billion involves only
the Huizhou complex, for which construction will begin in 2003.
More cash will be pumped into a subsequent phase involving oil
refineries, according to Xinhua.

The deal supports one view that foreign business deals with
China and many Asian nations require years of relationship
development. Shell already operates more than 20 oil and
chemical projects in China, but even after talks extended from
1988 to an agreed-upon framework in 1997, it took until this
weekend to ink the final details.

Xinhua reports $330 billion in foreign direct investment in
China since economic liberalization began in the 1970s.
Front-page placement on the People's Daily showcases China's
current commitment to foreign deals. Others this year include
Motorola's (NYSE: MOT) $1.9 billion chip-making complex
contract, announced in August, and the on-again, off-again CDMA
phone deal with Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM).

NEWS TO GO

Publishers Reed Elsevier (47% owned by Elsevier (NYSE: ENL)) and
Thomson Corp. announced a $4.45 billion cash purchase of rival
educational publisher Harcourt General (NYSE: H) on Friday. Reed
plans to keep Harcourt's medical, scientific, and technical
businesses. It will also retain the elementary and secondary
school textbook operations, but sell Harcourt's higher-education
and professional businesses to Thomson for $2.06 billion.
Harcourt closed Friday up 9.05% to $56.81.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)
and News Corp. (NYSE: NWS) are in talks over a possible
Microsoft $1 billion investment in Sky Global, News Corp.'s
global satellite TV asset and investment arm. News Corp. had
hoped to spin off Sky Global this year, but the move has been
reportedly postponed until next year due to the softening market
for public offerings.

DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: DCX) said it would shut down seven North
American manufacturing plants for a week -- four in the U.S. and
three in Canada. Spokesman Juergen Wittman told Reuters: "We
want to catch up with demand. We need to balance our inventory."
Wittman also said the action has nothing do with earnings or
Friday's 1.4 million unit Dodge, Chrysler, and Plymouth minivan
recall due to seal leaks.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Loral Space &
Communications (NYSE: LOR) CEO Bernard Schwartz is in talks with
Societe Europeene des Satellites about injecting cash or
partnering with the weakened company. Loral has been hit by
stumbles of its 40%-owned low-earth orbit satellite venture,
Globalstar (Nasdaq: GSTRF) -- whose satellite communications
system has seen a slower subscriber ramp -- and the hangover
from the failed Iridium satellite telephony venture. The Journal
reported that Schwartz promises not to put more cash into
Globalstar unless it makes sense compared to other stand-alone
investments. Loral has already pumped in $1 billion of the $4.3
billion Globalstar cash diet, and is slated to assume $500
million in debt by the end of the year. Loral's share price
closed Friday at $5.19 -- less than Globalstar's finish at $6.
