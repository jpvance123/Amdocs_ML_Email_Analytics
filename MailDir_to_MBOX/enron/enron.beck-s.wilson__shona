Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain 
non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be 
categorized as:

"morning report" - daily
Component V@R - daily
Adhoc V@R - as needed
Book reconciliation - as needed
Stress testing - as needed
Back testing - weekly
Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly


I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the 
upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC 
to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we 
need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these 
reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk 
management groups).

In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports 
prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the 
best way to go forward.

Best regards

Shona

I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on 
the 7th.  In doing this, I was reviewing the global operations presentation 
and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is "creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions." I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

Thanks

Rick, Rick,

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Thanks,
Richard

Dear Mike,

As we discussed, you will be heavily involved in constructing and 
implementing global standards and global reporting.  This is a strategic 
initative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey.  This 
absolutely must be in place by the end of the year.

Essentially, there are three main areas:

develop global (minimum) standards
develop & implement exception reporting to these standards
develop & implement global operation reporting

I have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects:

Global operating performance

This  will be the monthly reporting package.  Currently we do this for N. 
America.  We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations 
currently not included in this package.  The package is not intended to be 
incorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our 
own.

Timeline:
Aug 31 - Finalize what will be reported
Sept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each 
location and who is receiving and consolidating it)
Sept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated 
reporting package to report
Oct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting 
if necessary (continual improvements)

Global standards time line (daily reporting)

This will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we 
create.  This will be a daily reporting package.

Timeline:
August 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets
Quantitative (to be reported daily)
Qualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews)
Sept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards
Sept 30 - Finalize reporting format for quantitative reporting lines (who do 
we get it from, who consolidates it, who sees it, how often)
Nov 30 - Have reporting implemented - start reporting

Regards

SHona

PS - I'm also working on developing a monthly reporting summary for each 
office concerning what the latest developements are, much like they have in 
London.  I have Maria working on developing a list of all offices.

Here is a high level chart for you (you may want to check this with someone - 
I don't know if it is completely correct - I do know that there the middle 
office and commercial report to the office of the chair, not the board of 
directors).  Please let me know if this is what you need.  I'm working on the 
rest, I don't have any info on the systems flow, but am working with the 
trading office data I have to provide something to you.

I thank you all for volunteering to be members of the global standards task 
force.  To keep you up to date on what is going on:

I am receiving sporadic reporting from most groups. 
I have hired someone to be dedicated to this process (starting 1/1/01 - until 
then, it is me and one person starting 12/11 who can dedicate some time)
The key focus is report A01 and getting that consolidated - I am taking a 
stab at it today.
I am meeting with an Access programmer to develop a reporting tool to replace 
the current Excel format
By the end of the year my goal is to have daily reporting from all groups, to 
have someone dedicated to review this daily reporting and raise issues, and 
to have a dedicated IT person developing the Access database, to have weekly 
consolidated reporting for A01, to determine the appropriate time frames for 
reporting escalation and audience

What I would like the task force to concentrate on is to:
Help review the individual reporting to determine if:
It is adequate
Where we should go from the current reporting guidelines
Decide on appropriate audiences and levels for issue communication
Decide on reporting formats
Steer the process

I will send you copies of the reporting for the next couple of days so you 
can get an understanding of what I am receiving and the problems people are 
having.  Let me know your thoughts and concerns and I will consolidate them 
and then we can discuss them as part of the task force.

Best regards

Dear Sally,

I may have already sent this to you.  It is a process flow for how we should 
structure, execute, and follow up findings.  Let me know if you have any 
changes.  I've already given it to Donna, Cassandra, and Lynn Bellinghausen 
as a draft.

Also, just to let you know, the schedule is still being revised.  The latest 
version is with Cassandra.  I'll send you a new copy once they've revised 
it.  It will then goto Lynn's group.

Best regards

Dear Mike,

Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a 
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through 
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine 
how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding 
of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.

My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to 
determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to 
work on.

I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.

Thanks

Shona

Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an 
internal approach to internal audit

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Wow - lets chat about this

Mike

I would like you to join me in discussing the DPR, this Thursday at 9:30am.  
Topics I would like to discuss are:

what is currently reported in the DPR (accrual vs mtm)
company/location groups - what we are currently not capturing
relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

I strongly encourage you to attend as your input will be very valuable in 
helping us determine how we should go forward.  Please let Pamela Sonnier 
(X37531) know whether you can attend or not.

Thanks

Based on my discussions with Sally, and her discussions with Ted and Rick 
Carson, I've updated the process flows for Doorstep teams.  I've defined the 
roles and responsibilities for each group as well, which were not included in 
the original draft.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Best regards

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Dear John,

The following are the amounts that make up the $5.8 mil.  I have looked into 
your query and noted that there was a late adjustment not exported to us (so 
not captured in the DPR).  The adjustment will be reflected in today's DPR.

Please call me at 713 408 4315 if you have any questions.



Best regards

 Shona

Shona,
Pls do the following asap:

 Introduce yourself to John and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways 
to get information regarding the content of the DPR and Executive Reports.
 Pls consider this request.  I think it is a good idea to either put comments 
on the Corp DPR or each business unit should have their own summary executive 
report that could give more detail.

John,
FYI, Shona works in Sally Beck's Global Operations group and (among 5,000 
other things) is in charge of the group that puts together the DPR.
Cassandra Schultz, who is also copied here, is a VP who works for me in 
charge of Policy issues and works closely with Shona.

My first day physicallyt at Enron House is planned for 1/8/01.

Our DPR shows a $5.8 million loss in other for the day.  Can we add notes 
onto this report so we can see what is happening here - I am not
sure what this is.

Thanks!

Dear Vanessa,

I know our meeting to discuss putting trading offices on the web site keeps 
moving, but here is what we receive from London which represents Enron Europe 
information.  We should put this on the site.  I also have a list of all 
trading offices world-wide.  At some point, I'd like to merge the two.

Best regards

Dear David,

Thanks for your message.  To make our request clearer, for the past two weeks 
we have put out a preliminary DPR every morning at 8 am our time (seen by 
commercial heads, Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, RAC, anyone with access to the 
DPR).  All groups world-wide are able to provide us preliminary figures by 7 
am our time for:

positions, 
maturity gap,
VAR, and
P&L

This is the information that we would like you to provide as well.

I understand that you have some hurdles to get over to be able to provide us 
these figures, and while you keep working to get over these hurdles, we would 
be happy if you provide us the information you are currently able to (i.e. if 
you can only provide P&L we'd like to start with that, if you can only 
provide us with one commodities information we would like to have that). 
Please remember that the information we are requesting is preliminary 
information.  We would expect that there would be some changes between what 
you give us at 7 am and the final information you give us by 11 am.

Best regards

Shona

Subject: DPR Summary

Shona,

Just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday:

Preliminary P/L due @ 1PM Local (7pm Houston)

As I understand, Sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of 
presenting Skilling with a DPR by 8a.m. the following day.
I have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this.  We will discuss 
this in meeting early next week. 
A major obstacle that we face, is limited IT resource to re-engineer and 
expedite our processes.  This will require buy in of senior mgmt and 
commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects. 
(James to discuss.)
Additionally, there are certain dependencies on depts in Houston, which are 
prerequisite for DPR completion in London. Notably Continental Power has a 
dependency on Portcalc IT support in Houston.  
Shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult (not impossible) to implement 
in London as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions 
would make Enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer.  Bear in mind 
that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best 
talent.  A decision to use shift's would have to be made at the highest level 
considering the possible implications on the corporate image.  This might 
suggest that additional IT resource is the only feasible way forward.

I could easily say that we can do the preliminary p/l but I assume that we 
wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting.  Therefore I have 
tempered my comments to reflect what I believe are real issues that we in 
London will have to address.   We will get back to you with our proposals., 
after we have discussed these issues early next week.

Same day DPR

This is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to 
be sponsored at the highest level here in Europe.
James to discuss with Fernley & Mike. 


Regards,

Dave

As a follow up from our discussions on global standards, I have made some 
minimal changes to the operating standards and have started putting together 
a contact list.  In the upcoming week, I will be finalizing the daily 
reporting formats and will send those out to you next week.

In the mean time, could you please review the contact listing attached below 
and give Pamela Sonnier any updates.  Also, please designate resources in 
your team who will be responsible for the reporting going forward.

If you have any questions or comments please call me at 713 853 9123. 

Looking forward to working with you.

Dear Rick,

Thanks for the update.  I appreciate your input as I do not know what your 
discussions with Rick Buy have been.  To address your points below:

1)  I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each 
individual review although I am under the impression that Ted & Sally (by 
proxy Cassandra and I) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your 
group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process.  If my 
understanding is incorrect, please let me know.  

2) I agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings.  
However, due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to 
delivery of the report to Ted and Sally, your group really has to be focused 
on completing the deal test.    We don't need three different people 
obtaining the same information at the same meetings.  If there has been a 
change in your group's role from what I originally understood (we need lower 
level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test) , we 
may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it 
is done on time (by the time we leave the site). 

3)  Agreed - I'd like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far 
as the database is concerned before we meet again.

Best regards

Shona

Shona:  Thank you for your memo.  I think it is a good idea to define roles 
and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the 
initiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:

1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort, 
therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning 
and post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before 
presentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy 
and Causey.

2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is 
sometimes necessary to "divide and conquer".  However, where logistically 
possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in 
meetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding 
operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as 
furthering our goal of educating "multi-functional" people so that we can 
continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.

3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding 
the database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.

Please let me know if you have any questions,         Regards,       Rick

Dear Sally,

Hope all is going well.  The following is a list of things I'm working on.  

I'm midway through putting together the "straw-man" for the doorstep review - 
which will consist of a proposal on what our goals are, what should be done 
to meet those goals, who should do it, and when it should be done.  I hope to 
have it ready for your review during the week of the 12th.  I'm working 
together with Rick Carson on it, and also obtaining input from all the people 
who participated in previous doorstep reviews.
I'm working with Mike to determine what gaps we have in the DPR process 
(certain info may not be complete, some books are not received on a timely 
basis).  We have some thoughts, I just need to write them up and do a bit of 
research to determine how to deal with these issues.
I have a meeting set up with Jan-Erland for next Friday to discuss Japan.  
I've been attending the conference calls, but need to establish my role in 
the process.  I also received a message from Joe Hirl, and will set up a 
meeting with him while I'm in Japan.
I've made initial contact with India, and will start attending their 
conference calls.  Milind Laad has asked me to fly down to see the office, 
but before I do that, I need to get up to speed with what they have done 
already.
I've met with Eugenio and we have discussed the projects he works on.  He and 
I need to structure what his future projects are and the resources needed for 
those projects.
I'll be in London next week (I leave this Sunday and will be back in the 
office on Friday) working with Brent.  I expect he will be able to give me a 
lot of information to help with the doorstep straw-man.

Patti is trying to set up a weekly or bi-weekly discussion for us, starting 
the week of the 12th. Until that time, I'll keep you updated through e-mail 
and voice mail.  If you need me, I have given Patti all my contact info for 
next week.

Have a good week-end.

Shona

Shona - 

I just wanted to make sure you knew what a great job Chris does as a liason 
between your group and Market Risk Management on all the DPR and limit 
issues.  He is extremely responsive to our (MRM) inquiries and requests for 
information, and has been instrumental in helping me gather information and 
understand the DPR reporting process so that I can prepare better and more 
meaninful analyses for the BOD and for Rick Buy.  And he's been a pleasure to 
work with throughout all the changes to the notification process, and appears 
willing to embrace suggestions on how to improve risk reporting processes 
further.

Your entire group's teamwork and work ethic has enabled me to add value in my 
new position here, and while I got the opportunity to express this via PEP 
for you and Eugenio, I didn't do a review on Chris, so I wanted to make sure 
you knew.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Paul,

Thanks for the update.  Can you liase with Al Pennisi and Marcelo Parra to 
look at the R&N information?  We are trying to get a handle on how 
comfortable we are outsourcing the majority of the middle office for the US 
brokerage business.  Not just settlements, but nearly all functions.  Al is 
putting together some information regarding R&N.  Together with Al, Kevin 
Rhodes and Marcelo we should be able to come to a recommendation (either the 
middle office operations is something we should start to do ourselves, or 
that we think it is best to continue to use R&N as an outsourcer for the 
brokerage business).

If you want to discuss call me at 713 853 9123.

Regards

Shona

Hi Shona,

Ideally I think Will Morley (recent hire to London Documentation team) should 
be looking after the Documentation area as he is managing the London
side (I will confirm this)

On the Settlements side I am happy to look at the Rolfe & Nowlan side as I 
have around 10 years experience using and developing R&N in my
previous employments

thanks

Rebeccan and I had a meeting today with AA who is also planning to do some 
power west work.  In order to better coordinate with them, we are planning to 
move the Portland doorstep review from next week (the 18th) to the following 
week (the 25th).  Please let me know if you have any concerns about this.

Thanks,

Dear Sally,

Since we may not be able to have our bi-weekly meeting, I thought I'd let you 
know what's going on:

DPR
I'm working with London to determine how to report the MG DPR to us.  Nothing 
has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies & risk 
limits from our guys in London.
As you know, plenty of V@R questions have been coming our way, and are 
somewhat difficult for Mike's team to answer.  I talked with Eugenio and he 
is in the process of putting together some V@R analytics/graphs Mike's guys 
can easily create to answer simpler V@R questions.
Burton, a book analyst in Brent's group is coming back to Mike's DPR group to 
support Gary Stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve 
validations.  Jenifer Bagwell has taken Burton's place in Brent's group.

A while back, Eugenio created a database to capture information and allows 
book & commodity analysis.  He has been showing this to Business Unit 
controllers & the RAC group, but has not distributed it yet, due to security 
issues.  Currently, the database does not restrict different users to 
different commodities (power people can see gas and vice versa).  It will 
slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in, but it 
may be necessary.  I think the business controllers would not share the 
information with commercial, but I'm not sure about the analysts in the RAC 
group.  I'd like to get your opinion on this.

Doorstep
I've updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for 
offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year
Donna, Ted, Richard L. and I have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow 
up of the first visits - I'll update you after the meeting.

Hope you had a good vacation!

Regards

Here is a revised summary of the 13 candidates I sent to Tony Vasut.  I 
believe he has made initial contact with each of them.  If you decide you 
would like to talk to them, please don't mention my name, as some of them are 
former clients of mine, used to work with me, or still work with my husband 
(I think you get the picture - I've been gone from PwC less than a month).  
However, I would be pleased to talk to you about any of the people mentioned 
below.

I have categorized them into 5 categories - senior level, IT/Risk, mid level, 
junior level, and admin assistants.  I have not spoken to the majority of 
these people about giving our recruiting department their name (see note 
above), with the exception of Mark Smith, Dave Simpson, and Connie Shugart.  
All of these people have indicated great interest in coming to Enron.

Again, please call me with any questions, or need of further info.  My 
extension is 39123.

Best regards

Shona

Senior level risk people

Andy Dunn
until 3 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.  Due 
to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left 
the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit 
personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  I have worked 
with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to Enron.  
The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot, 
but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in 
leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith
Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.  We worked 
very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva 
trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had 
many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked 
in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).  
Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are extremely impressed with his 
knowledge and background.  I would highly recommend him for a leadership role 
at Enron.  I spoke to him and he is interested in pursuing opportunities at 
Enron.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  His cell phone number is 713 412 
3890.



IT/Risk people


Shawn lafferty, Alan Beaton, & Carolyn Johnson
These people are all senior managers in KPMG's Information risk management 
department and are all looking for opportunities outside KPMG.  They all have 
8+ years work experience in the IT field.  KPMG's main number is 713 319 2000.


Mid level risk people


Marilyn Chee 
She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for 
derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and all mtm 
accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was their auditor.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Scott Barnes
Scott is an audit manager at PwC.  He has worked in energy for his career, 
which he spent in Houston and Moscow and New York.  He has worked as an audit 
manager, a special projects manager for the managing partner of the Houston 
office, a manager in the capital markets group (the group responsible for 
helping non-US companies prepare to register and list with the SEC), and the 
transaction support group (the group that is resposnible for performing due 
diligence procedures for PwC clients).  He is looking for opportunities 
outside PwC.  The PwC general line is 713 356 4000.

Keith Considine
He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best senior PwC 
Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked 
with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of work experience 
(all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked for me on the 
Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both 
myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any 
of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working on a project at one 
of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .  He definitely 
does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently 
planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.  I actually 
recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to 
capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. His 
number is 713 356 5617.


Junior level risk people

Robin Manspeaker 
currently works as a scheduler at Equiva Trading.  She has been there about a 
year and a half.  Before that, she worked at Novarco in White Plains (a 
subsidiary of Marc Rich).  She was there about 3 years.  I do not know where 
she was before that.  I have worked with her during my audits of Marc Rich.  
She seemed very well versed in her knowledge of her job and processes 
surrounding it. I do not have her number, but you can call Shell information 
at 713 241 6161 and they will transfer you.

Dave Simpson
Analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work 
experience of about 2 years.  He is very interested in leaving Koch.  I know 
him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a good guy and 
very likeable.  His phone number is 713 544 7649

Robert Hernandez
is someone who may be able to fill an open position at Enron South America.  
Last year, Robert worked for me at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the 
external audit of Coral Energy.  He was a great worker and very good at his 
job.  He speaks fluent Spanish as well as fluent English.

Before working at PwC, Robert worked in the gas trading industry in the 
mid/back office.  I'm not sure of all of his responsibilities, but I do know 
he was involved in gas actualizations. In total, I think he has about 4 years 
of work experience.

He left PwC in March to take a position with Heins in their internal audit 
department.  I have not spoken to him since he left, but do know he paid a 
recruiter to find him this position.  I do not know if he is happy at his 
current company or not.

I do not know his number, but he can surely be found by using the general 
line.  I looked it up for you and came up with two - 713 785 1494, 713 225 
0565.


Admin assistants


Connie Shugart
she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.  She is also 
involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal 
audit service lines.  She is very interested in Enron and has asked me a few 
times to get her a contact here.  I have not worked directly with her but due 
to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was 
very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).  I have spoken to her 
about giving her name to Tony and she is very excited about coming over and 
interviewing.  She really wants to work for Enron!

Ellen Robertson
She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have 
never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she 
should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

Dear Kathy & Darren,
     I've spoken with Marcelo Parra here in New York regarding phone 
recording for the Enron Metals offices.  The RAC group insists that recording 
is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the 
equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is 
responsible, please let me know.  
     I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a 
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office 
in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital 
recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading 
desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in 
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in 
stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick 
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday 
afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?
    Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the 
Enron Metals people are moving to the existing Enron Chicago facilities 
before the end of the year.

Best  regards,
Mike

Dear Eugenio,

I did not want to say this when everyone else was around, but I am concerned 
that no attempt was made to meet the deadline of this morning that we 
discussed last Friday. (to decide on a name for the database).  Only Maria 
Teresa had her information to me this am as requested. The deadline could 
have been easily met by working diligently this morning, but Jennifer did not 
come in until 8:30 and MT until 8:15.

I thought we had discussed the urgency of this - to have something to present 
at the 10am meeting.  We need to discuss this to ensure it does not happen 
again.

Best regards

Thanks for your note.  With the increased focus on our middle office products 
and the possible outsourcing of those, I am in very stong agreement that all 
groups need to start documenting their processes and procedures and believe 
it falls under my responsibility to ensure they do so. 

I would be very interested in knowing a bit more about SCOR as any tools - I 
just received the package you sent me. I'll look it over and get back to you 
on how I intend to approach this.

Thanks

Subject: Your Input please

Shona

Sent a message to Sally earlier this week that I realised afterwards would 
have been best directed to you in the first instance. Apologies for that.

I was and still am, seeking input on the whole issue of the level of written 
control procedures we should have and the best way to achieve that. When I 
first started here I was a little surprised at the lack of written 
procedures. While I believe the actual control structure is good, there is 
very little in writing, even in the most generic form. In discussing this 
with Paul Quilkey, he noted that policy, at least when he was in Houston, was 
to deliberately minimise the written procedures to prevent it being too 
transportable.

The reason for my query is that I last week looked at SCOR, a control review 
process marketed by the Aust Financial Markets Association. It is a risk 
control review process which allows you to benchmark your processes and which 
provide detailed documentation which can be personalised to your business, to 
create controls review. It is very detailed and has been subscribed to by 
most of our competitors in the energy market. 

I am interested in subscribing, it we want/need detailed review notes, 
however in light of PQ's comments I wanted your feed back on exactly what is 
required/desirable to have for each site. 

With thanks

Heidi

I agree with the exception of point 3 below.  I plan for them to be one of 
several authorisers of bills (in no case however, the only authorisers).  
Also, I spoke to Sally about the "agency" office and she agrees that in the 
short term, the agency plan is what we need to implement.  However, a 
mentioned by both Ted and Sally, we need to discuss what the ultimate goal is 
for these offices (will they continue to exist?).  Let's call what we plan to 
implement now "Phase I".

Subject: Re: Trading v Origination Offices  

Thanks - I think this is a good start as far as roles go, but as I outlined 
to Shona last week, we should apply some basic rules to the process, (forgive 
me if obvious) for example:

Rule 1: No confirmations issued, chased or matched by remote offices

This should be done centrally and further all the customers of the remote 
office should be given contact numbers (e.g. fax) at the operations hub. That 
way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group.

Rule 2: No cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or 
reconciled by remote offices

Operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position.

Rule 3: No physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions 
approved or reconciled by remote offices

This splits the logistics process somewhat, but is essentially as with cash 
in that every movement of physical product should be approved (where 
necessary) and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs. 
The "initiation/optimisation" aspect of logistics could remain remote, since 
arguably it involves pseudo - trading.

Not exhaustive but helpful I hope.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these 
reviews.

Best regards

Shona

As referenced below, we have this information.  Let's meet tomorrow to go 
over an implementation approach.

Subject: ERMS DISCOUNTING Solution

Since December 1996, we have reserved for the over statement of our books 
because ERMS discounts from the first day of production rather than payment 
date (e.g. for gas the 25th of the following month).  The Calculaton for the 
ERMS Discounting Reserve is currently performed  monthly by Risk Controls and 
Reporting.  The December Reserve was ($7.8 million).  

At an ERMS/TAGG meeting this morning,  Zhiyong Wei and Jeremy Wong said that 
ERMS discounting could be corrected in two months.  Debbie Brackett, Chris 
Abel and I suggested that April 1st may be the best time to implement.  

Please advise Debbie, Chris or I of any concerns you may have with us 
implementing this ERMS calculation correction for a April 1st date.
Thanks, Sheila

Judging by the length of the spreadsheet, it looks like a pervasive problem.  
Nancy and I will work with debbie/some in credit to determine 
physical/financial guidelines and roll this out to the risk management groups.

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).

Dear Steve and Zhiyong,

I have had a chance to review the elaboration document for the executive 
report viewer.  I agree with the goals and objectives for this project.  As 
you are aware, this project is extremely high priority.  John Lavorato is 
expecting that several new reports be available as soon as possible.

We agreed that Hal would be fully dedicated to this project and the Risk 
Controls group.  Please confirm to me that Hal is fully dedicated to this 
project now and will continue to be until it is completed.  I would actually 
like his to sit with our group at least until the project is complete.

I would also like a breakdown of what the other IT people listed in the 
elaboration document will be responsible for, and discuss the 65 day 
estimation with you.

Thanks

Shona

Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday in the U.S., the NYMEX and equity markets 
will be closed on Thursday the 23rd and the NYMEX will be closed on Friday 
the 24th.  The consolidated DPR will report the 22nd's data on Monday the 
27th.  Additionally, the data for Thursday and Friday will be combined into 
one consolidated DPR and also reported on the 27th.  Although the reporting 
for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th are combined into one daily 
position report, violations will still be reported based on daily information.

Please continue to export your data as in the past.  We will need the data 
for each day separated and not combined for Thursday and Friday due to the 
need to assess the information against limits.  However, if your market is 
closed and there is no trading for the day, we do not need an export.

Please call me with any questions or comments X39123.

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments  

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use "WSCC", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the "Re:" say "Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000"
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona
