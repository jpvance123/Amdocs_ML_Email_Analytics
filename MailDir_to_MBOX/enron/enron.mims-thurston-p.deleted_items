Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with
you?  How are the proceedings coming along?

Everything on my end is okay...still a lot of unanswered questions and i'm
just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for
the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation,
whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.

I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm
wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on
Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?

By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really
wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not
behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked
out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.

Write back!!!!

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Hey girl!  I'm just getting back to the office.  I've been gone since about
11:30.  Hope and I went to Arnie's to buy the items we needed for the
shower.  The shower is at 4:00 pm on Saturday at Pappadeaux's on
Westheimer.

I'm certainly not going to church tonight, however, I may go on Friday.  My
mom and cousin are spending the night on Friday, so we'll see.

Are you going tonight?  I think I'm just going to go tomorrow.  What's
happening?  What time is the shower on Saturday?

   I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to
   look
   up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go
   together.

   I'll let you know what I find out.

      Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after
      you.
      I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston
   was
      burning rubber.

      Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
      grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
      she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them
   up
      early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue
   to
      pray
      for her.
      How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

      We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to
      Institute
      Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

      I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the
      problem
      was.

      Hey Sister Sims,

      You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
      rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a
      hard
      time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do
   need
      to
      look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

      How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going
      well
      for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for
      Jordan
      and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very
      immature.
      She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

      You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and
   facials
      and
      talk.

      Write back

         Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has
   to
      be
         EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo
      crazy.
         Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you
      weren't
         in
         Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it
      make
         you
         feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm,
   fuzzy
         feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the
   pictures.

         I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd
      call a
         plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

         I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on
      Sunday?
         I
         was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she
   sang
         with
         the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
         Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see
   what
         all
         the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

         After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was
      giving
         a
         small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go,
   but
         Steve
         asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how
      much
         he
         loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.
   He
         also
         apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to
      Siera
         for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the
   way
      he
         treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of
   her
      for
         speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.
   I
      felt
         like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you
   know
         what.
         He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
         snuggle
         up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.
   He
         immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!
   He
         then
         jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as
   if
         he's
         6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel
   so
         just
         go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and
   can't
         ask
         where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just
      really
         don't have time for his mess.

         So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write
   back.

         Hey girl,

         What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I
   really
         could
         have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last
      night I
         had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club
   and
         they
         had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.
   It
      was
         nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got
   their
      at
         6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and
      seating
         at
         6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But,
      girl,
         Ms
         Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in
   my
         semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my
      favorite
         stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my
      floor
         length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The
      top
         that
         I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and
   gold!
      I
         wore
         my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the
      ones I
         wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black
   high
         heel
         sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my
   appearance.
         When
         I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
         "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo
   the
         husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan
      take
         some
         pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

         We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home,
      Todd
         said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that
   really
         entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

         Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of
   rehearsal, I
         was
         wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday
   that
         she's
         back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

         How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe
      we'll
         get
         a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to
   be
      home
         until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to
      Power
         Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a
   change
         too.
         Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing
      much.
         All
         we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule
      different,
         independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean
      break
         and
         new environment.

         Oh well, talk with you later!

         Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

            Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've
      been
            extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received
   her
         report
            card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself
   into
            sickness.
            I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God,
      but
         she
            still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right
   now.
      The
            4th
            grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her
   lifted
      up
         in
            prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks
   that
         she's
            dumb
            and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
         letter
            last
            night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because
      she's
            not.
            She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That
      hurt
         me
            so
            bad.

            Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great
   job.
      The
            best
            thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

            How's the school search going for Jordan?

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Yes this is an Enron company.  You're right, just like old shoes and I hope everyone is well taken care of.

Get out of here!!!!  Is this an Enron company?  If so, I am so happy for you Lizzie, I will certainly miss you.  You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable! (just like "old shoes") .  I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job!

The confirmation for deal 1060746 was faxed this morning to Emma.  I called her and left her a message that if the confirmation was not received to please get back with me.

I also wanted to let you know that October 22nd is my last day.  I have accepted a position  with Freight Markets.  I am in the process of training Sean Riordan who will be taking my place.

ow
How are ya doing?  I hear you are doing  origination now with Laura Luce (sp?).  Are you liking it?  I have  been thinking of  you.
 
Me and the boys are just doing nothing but fun kids  stuff.   They go to Mothers Day out about twice and week from 9:00 to  2:00 and I really enjoy my alone time...  I have been trying to update my  house since we will be here for a while.  I updated my kitchen and am  redecorating the boys room.  I am also getting the entire upstairs painted  but the paint I picked might be a little dark.  I have a hard time picking  colors and paint but I am sticking with it for at least a year before I  repaint.    I think the color is starting to grow on me  already.
 
Hope the boys are doing great, I know they can be  handful!

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Patrice,
	Kaztex is saying that deal #1074625 should be at the flat gas daily price of $1.87, and that deal #1074647 should be at gas daily + 0.01 or $1.88.  Can you please either confirm that our prices are correct, or change them to match Kaztex's prices?  Please let me know as soon as possible - I need to get this finalized today.  Thank you!!!

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

We are going to try to get to the point of uploading our nomination into pegasys this month so we are changing the meters to correctly reflect what Sitara has vs what PGLC has.   

The trade zone TTP is available now and I am going forward and moving November deals into the new trade zone.  I am making a list of all the deals I am changing if anyone needs it.  



THESE ARE THE CORRECT METERS TO BE USED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2001

PGLC/TTP/TTP - All buys and sales that are not being nominated from a contract - ALL "CHICAGO PEOPLES" EOL DEALS ARE MAPPED TO THIS METER

PGLC/NGPL/NGPL - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NGPL Transport  Contract

PGLC/NBPL/NBPL01 - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NBPL Transport Contract

PGLC/ANR/ANR -All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an ANR Transport Contract

PGLC/MIDW/MIDW -All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Midwestern Transport Contract

PGLC/TRKL/TRNK - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Trunkline Transport Contract

PGLC/Alliance/ALNC - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Alliance Transport Contract Contract

PGLC/NGPL/MALV - ALL HUB DEALS

PGLC/NIG/NICOR - All deals at Skokie

PGLC/NGPL/PGL - - this meter is used for end users and city gate deliveries for PGLC, such as RFG

PGLC/NGPL/NSG - this meter is used for end users and city gate deliveries for Northshore Gas such as RFG

DO NOT USE THESE METERS AFTER OCTOBER 31, 2001

PGLC/NGPL/HUB
PGLC/NGPL/909285
PGLC/NBPL/103
PGLC/NBPL/81
PGLC/MGT/027062
PGLC/TRKL/80601
PGLC/ALLIANCE/ALNCE
PGLC/NGPL/HUB

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Cora,

Melba and I have a few questions regarding your email.  We left you a voice mail around 4:30.  Please call us as soon as you get this email, and we can discuss. Also, we are putting these products out on production, because we have questions regarding the set-up of Patrices products.  Please call us.  Thanks TARA

Originally we sent you this but now this is what we need to have set up:

We asked for

PGLC/NBPL/NBPL should be NBPL/Peoples/82 - Northern Border Manhattan
PGLC/NGPL/NGPL should be NGPL/Peoples/909285 - NGPL Peoples
PGLC/TTP/TTP should be PGLC/TTP/TTP - This was formerly PGLC/NGPL/909285 which is and INCORRECT meter on PGLC's side.  PGLC/TTP/TTP is the POOL for PGLC.  This product should be called Peoples Pool on EOL rather than PGLC/NGPL/Non Pool

Let me know

Cora, and Jad,

Please take a look at these two test deals that Patrice has requested.  I am still waiting on global to get the tradezone TTP added. I will let you know as soon as I hear from Sylvia Campos.  In the mean time please take a look at the other two test deals in sitara Parallel.  The deal numbers are as follows:

Nicor/E.Dubuque = 4037411
NBPL/Manhattan = 4037412

Please get back to me ASAP if these two products look good, and we can release them for production.
Thanks

Everything right now is currently mapped to PGLC/NGPL/909285 when deals are done on EOL.  THere are deals out there right now with this meter for future months.    These deals will need to be changed to PGLC/TTP/TTP manually.  The meter PGLC/NGPL/909285 should not be used after these new trade zones are set up.

This is how it needs to be set up :

PIPE/TRADE ZONE/FACILITY:

PGLC/NGPL/NGPL
PGLC/NBPL/NBPL
PGLC/TTP/TTP - We need to set up this trade zone.  Spoke with Russ Severenson

I know you had asked me in the past to go ahead and pass on to you traders which are pressuring us to get stuff out.  Do you mind calling or e-mailing Patrice Thurston-Mims and explaining to her the enormous back log we have in the testing area and the under staffed that we are.  Let me know if you any questions.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Dear Mrs. Thurston,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
http://continentalairlines.rsc01.net/servlet/cc4?JHEVCU*itptlQLgkhgEJht*z*UA
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard!

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

Subject:	ALLIANCE WINDFALL OUTAGE

I was just talking to Alliance about how they are going to handle the Windfall outage for June 5th and 6th.  Alliance is 95% sure that they will be taking AOS to zero for the weekend prior to the outage, so this will mean AOS will be zero for June 2-6 inclusive and the plants will be affected for Gas Days 5 and 6 only.

Any questions give me a call 

Thanks

Liz

            <p>Let us know what's going on and you could WIN $500!</p>
			<p>Now we want to know if you've bought a car yet, or if there's something more we can do to help you.
			    Your feedback is <i><b>very important</b></i>, as it will tell us whether or not we can close this request, and will also help us improve the way we do business in the future.</p>
			<p>In addition, you can rate the performance
              of StoneAge.com and our dealerships. Each month we select one customer
              and award them $500 just for responding! After you update your request you are automatically
              entered in the drawing.<p>

I have the eye creme and the eye liner.  However, I will be out of the office until Monday.  So I will bring it then.  Also, I will see if I can get the stress free cologne.  I don't have that.

Hello,

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.  

Thanks!

Patrice,
I know you guys are in a new building now.  Would it be possible if you could fax over your new address on letter head?  Our fax number is 630-983-4583.

Patrice my home life really has me sick to my stomach.  I am so angry at him, I would like to scratch his eyes out.  Pray for me.  It just isn't fair.

Attached is a copy of my resume.  I was informed by another admin. coord. that most companies are not familiar with the job title Admin. Coord. which is comparable to Executive Assistant for most companies.  Let me know what you think or if you see something I should change.  Thanks for your help.

 a 2.5+ GPA who would use the scholarship to attend an undergraduate or gra=
duate program full-time at an accredited four-year college.  Some scholarsh=
ips are available to students who attend two-year colleges.  Partial schola=
rships are sometimes available to students who attend part-time.  Individua=
l results vary. Students may receive more or less than $20,000 in combined =

Yes, I have a reservation at the Westin. What time do you want to head out on Tuesday? Call my room in the morning when you get up and moving around. My cell phone, just in case, is 281-300-3225. 

Jason Williams in credit, Jeff Hodge, and I had a conference call late Friday. You already know everything we talked about I'm sure. Jeff advised that we should have a number in mind that they may be asking for. Hopefully Jason called you...............

See you in the morning!
Valerie

Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?  It is the Westin.  Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?  As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).  Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.  Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.  I'll be in the office until around 10:30.

Thanks

Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.

Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.  His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from this day forward.

I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.

An outage that was previously scheduled for the 21st @ Morinville & Albert Lea compressors on Alliance was moved to the 20th and AOS was reduced to 10% for 1 day only, the rest of the month we should see high AOS at least over 20%.  There was also maintenance scheduled for the 27th but this has been cancelled.  


Any questions give me a call

Thanks

Liz

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Congratulations!
We're ready to send your FREE GIFT

Congratulations! You've been chosen to receive the best-selling, Meikai
 35 mm Switchable Panorama Camera - absolutely FREE!

To claim your FREE 35mm Panorama Camera, click the link below

http://www.play4keeps.com/rd.cgi?camera

How can I afford to give away the camera people have paid as much as $65 for?"

Simply put, I can't. At least not to everyone, but you were smart enough to request free products from your-free-present, so you're entitled!

But here's the catch! There is very limited supply - we will not be getting this camera again and folks have been ordering this camera like crazy.

In fact, just before I sent this email my inventory quantities showed only 83 left. So, I need you to click the link below so I can ship yours before they're gone! Do it now, and I guarantee you'll be one of the very lucky folks to receive this terrific camera - FREE!

<>, I look forward to sending you more top quality products in the future. However, if you don't want to receive emails with free merchandise (although I can't imagine why!) simply click the link below and we'll pass your offer on to someone else.

http://www.play4keeps.com/rd.cgi?camera
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!

Lori Anderson
Customer Service

- Lightweight, pocket-sized (4.25" X 2.75") size is perfect for trips!

Patrice,
 we were invoiced by Crestar Energy Marketing Corp for 263,155 USD on deal 1074411 however the commodity price is 0 and there are no other charges.  Settlements are confused on how to procede. Do you recognize the deal? Any information you could offer would be most helpful!

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.

The basic reason we are changing meters in Sitara is because when PGLC was originally set up, the meters were set up using the same name as what the pipeline called them, i.e. NGPL/909265. This is the NGPL meter number NOT the PGLC meter number.  The PGLC Meter number is PGLC/NGPL.  The only reason we are doing this is so we can have everything correctly reflected so we can upload noms into pegasys with the meter number PGLC specifically used. 

The 3 products that will be in place for November at PGLC are:

NBPL/Manhattan - this is where we are buying Northern Border Specific Gas to take to PGLC at the NBPL/Peoples/82 (Manhattan transfer point).  We will then have a meter bounce ticket to take it from NBPL/PGLC/82 to PGLC/NBPL/NB01 and take it into our pool.

NGPL/Peoples - this is where we are buying NGPL specific gas to take to PGLC at the NGPL/Peoples/909285 Meter.  We will then have a meter bounce ticket to take it from NGPL/Peoples/909285 to PGLC/NGPL/NGPL and take it into our pool.

CHI Peoples - this is where we are buying pool gas at PGLC at the TTP pool. - this is the product that has been out there but all deals will be mapped to the TTP point. THis is where the majority of customers give us our gas.


The only time we will be using the meter PGLC/NGPL/NGPL, PGLC/NBPL/NB01, PGLC/ANR/ANR,  and other PGLC/pipeline specific meters is when gas is actually being delivered on a contract into the gate.  For the most part all of our gas will be at meter PGLC/TTP/TTP.


Thanks!!

Cora

The confirmation for deal 1060746 was faxed this morning to Emma.  I called her and left her a message that if the confirmation was not received to please get back with me.

I also wanted to let you know that October 22nd is my last day.  I have accepted a position  with Freight Markets.  I am in the process of training Sean Riordan who will be taking my place.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Hey Patrice,
I realize that you are a busy girl, but I would appreciate it if you could find some time to fill out the performance evaluations for Margie Straight and Jessica White.  Your opinion does matter in that these girls are new to the gates and I need to make sure that you feel that your needs are addressed.
Thanks Lisa

Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

Let me know how the test goes.

Thanks,
Marlo

Subject:	RE: Nicor Hub contracts

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know. 

Thanks,

Cora

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

Vonda,=20

These are the changes that Enron Legal would like you to consider.  Please =
review and let me know if these changes are acceptable. These changes would=
 be be inserted and would replace the sections under Demand Charge, Transac=
tion Default Price, Reference Price and Flexible Pricing.

I know.......let me know what you think.=20

Thanks


Demand Charge for Physical Call Option

Buyer shall pay Seller $0.03 per MMBtu multiplied by the FMDQ, plus fuel, m=
ultiplied by the number of days in the Month of Delivery.

Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Customer=
 may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed =
Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours re=
questing any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled dur=
ing selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request m=
ust be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the =
last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month. =
 A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible =
Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fixe=
d dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which =
a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original C=
ontract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to =
the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acc=
eptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless=
 for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity=
 of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quanti=
ty of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without l=
imitation events of Force Majeure.

What's happening down in your area?  It's very scary.  You just don't know what's going to happen!  It's a crying shame what's happening to Enron.  Who would have ever thought this?

Originally we sent you this but now this is what we need to have set up:

We asked for

PGLC/NBPL/NBPL should be NBPL/Peoples/82 - Northern Border Manhattan
PGLC/NGPL/NGPL should be NGPL/Peoples/909285 - NGPL Peoples
PGLC/TTP/TTP should be PGLC/TTP/TTP - This was formerly PGLC/NGPL/909285 which is and INCORRECT meter on PGLC's side.  PGLC/TTP/TTP is the POOL for PGLC.  This product should be called Peoples Pool on EOL rather than PGLC/NGPL/Non Pool

Let me know

Cora, and Jad,

Please take a look at these two test deals that Patrice has requested.  I am still waiting on global to get the tradezone TTP added. I will let you know as soon as I hear from Sylvia Campos.  In the mean time please take a look at the other two test deals in sitara Parallel.  The deal numbers are as follows:

Nicor/E.Dubuque = 4037411
NBPL/Manhattan = 4037412

Please get back to me ASAP if these two products look good, and we can release them for production.
Thanks
TARA

Everything right now is currently mapped to PGLC/NGPL/909285 when deals are done on EOL.  THere are deals out there right now with this meter for future months.    These deals will need to be changed to PGLC/TTP/TTP manually.  The meter PGLC/NGPL/909285 should not be used after these new trade zones are set up.

This is how it needs to be set up :

PIPE/TRADE ZONE/FACILITY:

PGLC/NGPL/NGPL
PGLC/NBPL/NBPL
PGLC/TTP/TTP - We need to set up this trade zone.  Spoke with Russ Severenson

I know you had asked me in the past to go ahead and pass on to you traders which are pressuring us to get stuff out.  Do you mind calling or e-mailing Patrice Thurston-Mims and explaining to her the enormous back log we have in the testing area and the under staffed that we are.  Let me know if you any questions.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

You With your knowledge, experience, and all those who know you, you would never have to worry about finding another job.  You might have to leave TEX.  But, mirant and elpaso is growing, just as well as AEP and Aquila.  There are a lot of rainbows on you side.  :)  By no means should you ever be worried.

       Dear Amazon Customer,   A little bird told us you just placed your f=
irst order at  Amazon.com. (Actually it was an ultrasecure, heavily guarded=
 computer  system--but the bird sounds friendlier.) At any rate, I'd like t=
o take  this opportunity to welcome you to Amazon.com and introduce you to =
 some fun, free services every Amazon shopper should know  about.    [IMAGE=
]    [IMAGE]    First off,  sign up for Delivers . Our expert editors will =
send you  information-packed e-mails about the topics that interest you mos=
t. Choose  from over 100 subjects--from DVD New Releases and Mystery  Books=
 to Bargain Music and Children's Software.       [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]    Next=
, are there authors you adore, musicians you  admire, actors or directors y=
ou absolutely love? Then sign up for  Amazon.com Alerts . We'll send you an=
 e-mail to let you know  when a new release from that person first becomes =
 available.       [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]    Last order of  business--send an e-=
Card . It's a fun way to keep in touch with  friends. Our wacky e-Card crea=
tive team has come up with clever  greetings for every occasion under the s=
un. When they run out of  holidays, they create their own--such as Bad Hair=
 Day.           That's it. Thanks again for shopping at Amazon.com. We hope=
 you'll  stop in again soon and put these special services to work for  you=
.     Sincerely, [IMAGE] Jennifer Cast  General Manager and Avid Amazon Sho=
pper   We hope you enjoyed receiving this message. [IMAGE]   Prefer not to =
receive these e-mails or want to adjust your e-mail  preferences? Please vi=
sit your Amazon.com  Account page  and click the  "Update your communicatio=
ns preferences" link.      =09

Money

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>

 

It can buy a House

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/house.jpg>

But not a Home

 

It can buy a Bed

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/tired_lg_wht.gif>

But not Sleep



 

It can buy a Clock

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/italian_pendulum_clock_swaying_sm_wht.gif>

But not Time

 

It can buy you a Book

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/book_page_flip_md_wht.gif>

But not Knowledge

 



It can buy you a Position

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/whiteman_cellphone_talking_md_wht.gif>

But not Respect

 



It can buy you Medicine

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bottle_spill_md_wht.gif>

But not Health

 

It can buy you Blood

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bloodbag.jpg>

But not Life

 



So you see money isn't everything.
And it often causes pain and suffering.
I tell you this because I am your Friend,
and as your Friend I want to
take away your pain and suffering!

  <http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>

So send me all your money and I will suffer for you! Cash only please.

To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

 <p align=center><b><font
 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=red
 size=5>Welcome and let us introduce you to the best kept secret in
 the financial markets today. A secret that your
 bank would like to keep to itself.</font></b></p>
 <p align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size=3><b>WHAT IS THIS BIG SECRET AND WHY DOESN'T YOUR BANK </b></font></p>
 <p align=center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size=3><b>WANT YOU TO KNOW IT??</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The
 secret is Tax Defaulted Paper and the reason
 they don't want you to know about it is simple
 .For decades they have been using your passbook
 savings and CD money at low, low, low rates
 of interest to purchase high yielding Tax lien
 and deed certificates. </font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>How
 does this sound? Your bank borrows your money
 at 3% and uses that money to purchase tax lien
 certificates at 24%. <b><u><font color=blue>That
 is a spread of 21% or $2100.00 per ten thousand
 dollars that is invested.</font></u></b> In
 short, you get $300.00 and they get $2100.00
 profit per ten thousand dollars. That is a profit
 to the bank of over 700% on your money. What
 a great way for the rich banks to get richer.
 Up until now, this was a secret known only to
 a select few.</font></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>So
 what is this product? And why is it such a lucrative
 investment vehicle? We call it TDP, Tax Defaulted
 Paper. It's simple and straightforward. Local
 governments are in the business of running their
 government. They have to pay their government
 employees, police, fire, school teachers, pave
 the roads, fix the sewers, run the hospitals
 and public transportation, collect the garbage,
 etc. The money they use does not grow on trees.
 The money they spend is raised from your local
 real estate taxes. As we all know not everyone
 pays their taxes. There are over 3000 counties
 across the United States in need of real estate
 tax revenue. When they can't collect they start
 getting serious about getting it collected.
 This creates a great opportunity for serious
 investors in the know.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=blue
 size=3><b>Hard to believe this is true? In just one day, we bought
 approximately $80,000 in tax lien certificates
 paying 18% and we are currently researching
 tens of thousands of dollars in additional TDP
 that we are planning to purchase.</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>What
 kind of owner doesn't pay their taxes and what
 kind of property is this? These properties include
 everything from single-family homes to large
 commercial properties.&nbsp; For example, we
 researched a tax lien on a commercial property
 with a $23,000.00 tax lien levied against it.&nbsp;
 The property was a Walgreen's drug store!!!&nbsp;
 </font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Not
 only does the investor earn 18% on that money
 till Walgreen's pays off, but, he or she gets
 a crack at the underlying real estate worth
 over $1,200,000. That's the possibility of owning
 real estate for just pennies on the dollar.&nbsp;
 <b><u><font color=blue>That investor could be
 you.</font></u></b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=blue
 size=3><b>Why don't we own it?&nbsp; Someone beat us to it. Timing
 is everything and in this business, time is
 money.&nbsp; Getting started tomorrow instead
 of today, costs you money.&nbsp; Spending months
 or even years trying to learn it yourself, instead
 of letting an expert teach you, costs you money.</b></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>This
 is why our customers buy our programs. We provide
 turnkey programs for the serious entrepreneur
 and investor, with advice and guidance on how
 to take full advantage of this high yielding
 and very profitable industry. Without a doubt,
 this is a multi-billion dollar industry of which
 the true potential has not been tapped. Yes,
 there are other people who know how it works
 but they can't help you get the job done effectively.

 know that so far it sounds too good to be true.
 But, it gets even better because investing your
 money our way is risk free. <b><u><font
 color=blue>There is virtually no risk of losing your money.</font></u></b>
 Your money is secured by the underlying real
 estate.How does that work? It's simple, you
 give the local government your money for someone's
 past due property taxes. Then, when the property
 owner pays the back taxes, the county pays you
 back your money plus interest so high you will
 be upset that you didn't know how to do this
 before you lost all that money in the stock
 market. What if the tax lien is not paid off?
 Simple, you get the property. Once again owning
 the underlying real estate for just pennies
 on the dollar.</font></p>

 this out for size. If you lost a chunk of your
 IRA?s value and are concerned that it will take
 too long for the market to come back, here is
 your solution. Our programs will teach you how
 to use your self-directed IRA to repair the
 damage done by the market. You can purchase
 TDP?s in your IRA with rates high enough that
 in no time you can replace what you have lost.
 Think of it this way, how long will it take
 for you to double your money at 24% or better?
 Answer! <b><u><font
 color=blue>Less than three years.</font></u></b> Not too bad verses
 a market that will take decades to repair itself
 and doing it in TDP?s is risk free to boot.
 Its kind of like you have your cake and can
 eat it too. Here is a quiz for you. What will
 $5,000 be worth in twenty years growing tax
 deferred at 24%? Approximately $3,174,000.00.
 Not too bad for totally risk free investing.

Whoever is doing gas settlements should know whether we are getting paid.  The contract was terminated as of the date of the sale.

Subject:	Heartland Steel---CSN 

Hey Guys,


I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Val,
I know you don't know me that well, but I am a minister at my church and I =
am in charge of the prophetic ministry there. I train people to operate pro=
perly in prophetic ministry if they have a prophetic gift. I have a team of=
 people that I work with.

I just wanted to let you know, when I got on the elevator a little while ag=
o, my prophetic gift activated.  Sometimes it happens when I least expect i=
t, but that's God.   Anyway, when I looked at you, I clearly heard the Lord=
 say, "I am going to bless her immensely in the days to come.  Everything t=
hat has been taken from her, I will restore. I will restore to her, healing=
 and joy." God is even going to restore material things to you.  It will be=
 just like Job, the end of your story will be greater than the beginning.  =
 I seen you with this man and you were so happy.  You have went through a l=
ot of devastation emotionally and God said He is going to restore you.  The=
 husband I seen in the vision loved you so much, a portion of your healing =
will come through him by God, but ultimately all healing comes from the Mas=
ter.  God has already begun the healing process in you.  I have watched you=
 over the past few months and I could tell something was wrong with you, bu=
t recently, a change has taken place for you in the spirit realm and God is=
 doing a work in you, strengthening you and reshaping you.  You are going t=
o be ok and so blessed in the end and God will get the glory.  He loves you=
 and He cares so much about you.   He wants you to know that He is doing th=
e work that you cannot.

Stay encouraged because you have the victory!
Love,
June

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

We have created a web based control panel that will give your
company most of the features previously only available in a dedicated server, at a fraction of the cost!

Our comprehensive control panel not only enables you to provision your
customers services, it also allows YOUR end users to control most
aspects of their hosting right from their browser.

You may customize the graphics that are displayed on the interface your client sees,
so YOUR customers never even know we exist. We can also help you register
aliased name servers to provide total anonymity.

Your Virtual Dedicated Server will have all of the following features:
*- Add/Delete Domain Names at your convenience
*- Automated DNS Provisioning
*- Add/Delete MYSQL Databases
*- Complete Web based E-mail Provisioning
.and too many additional features to list

   >>I walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in
   >>buying groceries.  I wasn't hungry.
   >>
   >>The pain of losing my husband of 37 years was still too raw.  And
   >>this grocery store held so many sweet memories.
   >>
   >>Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd pretend to go
   >>off and look for something special.
   >>
   >>I knew what he was up to.  I'd always spot him walking down the
   >>aisle with the three yellow roses in his hands.  Rudy knew I loved
   yellow
   >>roses.  With a heart filled with grief, I only wanted to buy my few
   >>items and leave, but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy
   >>had  passed on.  Shopping for one took time, a little more thought
   than
   >>it
   >>had for two.
   >>
   >>Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and
   >>remembered how Rudy had loved his steak.
   >>
   >>Suddenly a woman came beside me.  She was blond, slim and lovely in
   >>a soft green pantsuit.  I watched as she picked up a large pack of
   >>T-bones, dropped them  in her basket, hesitated, and then put them
   back.
   >>She
   >>turned to go and once again reached for the pack of steaks.
   >>
   >>She saw me watching her and she smiled.  "My husband loves T-bones,
   >>but honestly, at these prices, I don't know."
   >>I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes.
   >>"My  husband passed away eight days ago," I told her.  Glancing at
the
   >>package in her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice.
   >>"Buy him the steaks.  And cherish every moment you have together."
   >>
   >>She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed
   >>the package in her basket and wheeled away.
   >>
   >>I turned and pushed my cart across the length of the store to the
   >>dairy products.  There I stood, trying to decide which size milk I
   should
   >>buy.  A quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream
   >>section near the front of the store.  If nothing else, I could
   >>always fix myself an ice cream cone.  I placed the ice cream in my
   cart
   >>and looked down the aisle toward the front.
   >>
   >>I saw first the green suit, then recognized the pretty lady coming
   >>towards me.  In her arms she carried a package.
   >>On her face was the brightest smile I had ever seen.  I
   >>would swear a soft halo encircled her blond hair as she kept
   >>walking toward me, her eyes holding mine.  As she came closer, I saw
   what
   >>she held and tears began misting in my eyes.
   >>"These are for you," she said and placed three beautiful long
   >>stemmed yellow roses in my arms.  "When you go through the line, they
   >>will
   >>know these are paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on
   my
   >>cheek, then
   >>smiled again.
   >>
   >>I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the roses meant, but
   >>still unable to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded
   my
   >>vision.  I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green
   >>tissue wrapping and found it almost unreal.  How did she know?
   >>Suddenly  the answer seemed so clear.  I wasn't alone.
   >>"Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you?  I whispered, with
   >>tears in my eyes.  He was still with me, and she was his angel.
   >>
   >>Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you are.
   >>[Please read all of this, it is really nice]
   >>This is a simple request.  If you appreciate life, send this to
   >>your friends, including the person that sent it to you.
   >>
   >>Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the alarm
   >>rings,thank you, Lord, that I can hear.
   >>There are many who are deaf.
   >>
   >>Even though I keep my eyes closed against the morning light as long
   >>as possible, thank you, Lord, that I can see.
   >>Many are blind.
   >>
   >>Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, thank you, Lord,
   >>that I have the strength to rise.
   >>There are many who are bedridden.
   >>
   >>Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are
   >>lost, toast is burned and tempers are short, my children are so loud,
   >>thank you, Lord, for my family.
   >>There are many who are lonely.
   >>
   >>Even though our breakfast table never looks like the pictures in
   >>magazines and the menu is at times unbalanced, thank you,Lord, for
   >>the food we have.
   >>There are many who are hungry.
   >>
   >>Even though the routine of my job often is monotonous,
   >>thank you, Lord, for the opportunity to work.
   >>There are many who have no job.
   >>
   >>Even though I grumble and bemoan my fate from day to day and wish
   >>my circumstances were not so modest, thank you, Lord, for life.
   >>
   >>Pass this on to the friends you know, it might help a bit to make
   >>this world a better place to live, right?
   >>PASS IT ON....
   >>A friend is someone we turn to when our spirits need a lift.
   >>A friend is someone to treasure.  For friendship is a gift.
   >>A friend is someone who fills our lives with Beauty, Joy and Grace
   >>And makes the world we live in a better and happier place.
   >>YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM HONORED!
   >>
   >>Now send this to every friend you have.
   >>this was sent to me by a friend, and is now passed on to YOU, my
   >>friend

"Instead of using a lubricant, I use Vitara?. It feels more natural and 
definitely makes sex more fun." -Pattie, 42 years old
Ever since the launch of Viagra?, women all over the world have been asking
"Where's mine?"  In today's world, it would be naive to think that men were 
the only ones interested in achieving sexual pleasure. 
Vitara? has been patient tested for over 2 years to ensure that every 
woman that uses it gets the most from their sexual experience. 
Vitara? is a topical cream that is completely safe, non-toxic, and easy to use.Click Here for More! 
"I like the extra sensitivity Vitara? adds, now I know I'll have an orgasm
every time." -Tricia, 28 years old
Take control of your sex life and raise the level of your intimate relationship
to heights you've always dreamed of and deserve!
Vitara? is proud to be listed in the 2001 Physicians Desk Reference (PDR)
used by Doctors nationwide. In fact, Vitara? is the only product listed 
within this text under the heading Female Sexual Aids/Enhancers. Click Here for More! 
"I thought I knew sexual pleasure before, but I have never in my life 
experienced such an incredible orgasm. Thank you so much for this
incredible product. My life will never be the same again." -Sherry, Las Vegas, NV

"For the first time in years I am able to enjoy sex as much as my husband. 
He says the feelings during sex remind him of when we were first married."
Wendy - 51 years old
Several studies have shown that in excess of 40% of females suffer from
some type of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction has been divided into 
four subclasses. Three of these four subclasses can be attributed to a 
decrease in blood flow to the female genitalia. In particular, the lack of 
blood flow to the clitoris makes reaching orgasm very difficult or impossible 
to obtain. Vitara? causes increased blood flow instantaneously to the 
genitalia, which, with manual stimulation has shown to allow women to 
experience an orgasm. Also, the natural-occurring estrogens and hormonal 
precursors found in the yams and DHEA increase vaginal moisture.Click Here for More!

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.  Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.  The EAP counseling service is provided at no cost to employees and their family members.  To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

Informational Brochures
Additional information about EAP programs will be available in the Body Shop, the Health Center on the third floor of Enron Center North and soon in the common kitchen areas on all floors of the Enron Buildings.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

I do not remember his mother's name.  I know his sister name, Brenda Coates.  His name is Ronald Antonio Coates.  I have tried as close as I can get to his old friends.  My brother in law is his friend.  I am going to try to ask cust service to see.  My other direction is to call the University to find maybe an address.  I was told he might live in Kansas, but that is not for sure.

Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst
of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?
Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely,
someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go,
go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his
full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma
have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

   Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to
   remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy
   here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.
   His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so
   that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual
   activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He
   would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i
   told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last
   statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from
   this day forward.

   I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look
   at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.

Thanks.  I've sent you the NGPL presentation.  Nothing Earth shattering, but you may find some of the expansion & storage info interesting.

Subject:	PEPL Class
Importance:	Low

Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven

Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d


Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7

Kimberly, please have the staff e-mail you the comments that they made yesterday about the states/areas/accounts they are covering.  I want you to put together a summary for everyone on this matter.  In addition, I want to get a list from everyone of any markets that are no longer willing to transact with ENA due to credit issues.  Need the list today.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't in
Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make you
feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?  I
was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang with
the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what all
the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving a
small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but Steve
asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much he
loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He also
apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what.
He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle
up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He then
jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's
6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just
go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't ask
where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
don't have time for his mess.

So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

Nytasha

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could
have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they
had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at
6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms
Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that
I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore
my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel
sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When
I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some
pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was
wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's
back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get
a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.
Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All
we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and
new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

   Subject:  Hello

   Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
   extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
   card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
   sickness.
   I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
   still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
   4th
   grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
   prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's
   dumb
   and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter
   last
   night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
   not.
   She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me
   so
   bad.

   Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
   best
   thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

   How's the school search going for Jordan?
