 -----Original Message-----
From:  Burk, Bart  
Sent: Wednesday, May 02, 2001 12:33 PM

Subject: The Price Anderson Act - Nuclear Power

I called the Nuclear Information and Resource Service in D.C. and spoke to a 
representative. He mentioned that the Price Anderson Act has brought about 
opposition in the past, but has typically breezed through the renewal 
process. The NIRS website seemed to more anti-nuclear power focused, so it 
was interesting that he did not see the Act as having any trouble in its 
renewal.

My perspective is that nuclear power accounted for about 20% of all power 
generation last year, and would cause rolling black-outs if ceased. Politics 
and recent surveys of the positive turn in public opinion suggests that it 
would be highly unlikely for nuclear power to be phased out. Nuclear plants 
nearing the end of their initial useful life period - around 30 years - have 
already begun an extension process. Five reactors have been licensed for 
another 20 years of operation. The WSJ article stated that within the next 15 
years, 40% of the 103 licensed U.S. reactors are likely to request similar 
extensions.

Independents are buying-up the plants from utilities and taking advantage of 
high power prices and low nuclear fuel costs. The new technologies mentioned 
in the article suggest that an overrun of construction permits may be filed 
in the near future. Smaller megawatt units operate at lower temperatures, and 
are thus less susceptible to catastrophic failure if their cooling systems 
are crippled. Investment costs are modest, construction times are faster, 
power could be supplied in a shorter period of time, and the NRC has improved 
the time for the approval process. Companies could re-coup their costs and 
make decent profits within a short period, even if there were fears of 
negative opposition down the road.

A negative outcome for the Price Anderson Act renewal could slow plans to 
build new nuclear plants, but it is likely that existing plants will continue 
to operate. At a minimum, base load nuclear power generation should be flat 
over the next couple of years.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

I have done a crappy job of being a witness and a friend.  You are correct,
and rightly so about the way I have patronized you.  It has not been a
conscious effort, but I understand your perspective and as I look at me, I
am forced to admit you are correct.  Christian hypocrites are a dime a
dozen, and I am ashamed that I have fallen far short of what He has called
me to be.

I am very thankful for your business over that last 3 years.  I know that my
success here has been largely because of your help and business and I and my
family thank you for it.

I have taken your name off the Daily Word distribution list as you have
requested.  My best to you and your family and your success in business.  It
is my hope that I can be a better friend, witness and more to you again.

Thanks for

Todd Gross

Lon,

I added sensitivity of the ostrip premium to the basis offset (output 10)
for the forward start options in OSTRIP2 model

I added forward vega (7) gas daily vega (8) and Charm (9) previously
for Larry May.


Please find the example spreadsheet and Exotica add-in.   (you need to
delink your Exotica addin and Browse to select the new addin).
After you test it, we can put into the release version.   Use the attached 
addin
as the temporary one.

Let me know your comments.

Zimin

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.  


Thanks,

Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am
sending you.'
John 20:21 (NIV)

Jesus again identified himself with his Father. He told the disciples by
whose authority he did his work. Then he passed the job to his disciples of
spreading the gospel of salvation around the world. Whatever God has asked
you to do, remember: (1) your authority comes from God, and (2) Jesus has
demonstrated by words and actions how to accomplish the job he has given
you. As the Father sent Jesus, Jesus sends his followers...and you.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Dear AMU Student:

Thank you registering for classes at AMU.  This e-mail is your
confirmation that we have received your registration and that you are
enrolled in one or more courses.  We wish you the best of luck in your
class.

To ensure that you are properly prepared for your course, there are three
(3) more quick things you need to do:

Step 1: If Eligible, Get Tuition Assistance

If you have not already done so, you will need to go to your Education
Center or Human Resource Office to get completed Tuition Assistance (TA)
paperwork.   In order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or
HR professional and accepted by AMU, the following information must be
correct:

- Course Number and Title

- Course Start and End dates

- The amount per credit hour ($250 per semester hour).

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not
provide access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid
Office has received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be
faxed to 703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the
semester.  If you encounter any problems with your TA paperwork please
immediately send an e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398
ext 117.

Step 2: Order Your Books

In order to provide the best possible customer service and to allow
students to track the status of their book shipments, AMU changed its book
ordering process effective April 9, 2001.  It is now requested that
student contact MSB directly to order books.

Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

Call 1-800-325-3252

Give Customer Service your name, and the AMU course(s) you=01,re taking.

Step 3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you=01,re done.

After MBS has confirmed your book order, you will be issued a UPS tracking
number that you can use to check to the status of your book(s).  If you
encounter any problems with your book shipment, or if your book(s) do not
arrive, you will need to contact MBS at the number listed above (please
note that APO/FPO shipping times generally take longer than regular CONUS
mail so please order your books as soon possible).

MBS can be reached toll free 1-800-325-3252 during the following hours
(Central Time):

Monday - Thursday 7 am - 10 PM

Friday 7 am - 6 PM

Saturday 8 am  - 5 PM

Sunday  12pm - 4 PM

All foreign or APO/FPO students may want to use the MBS commercial number
which is (573) 441-9179.

Graduate students are required to purchase their books.  You may order
books from our preferred provider, MBS Direct,  by going to
http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.  If you order your books on-line, MBS
discounts the UPS shipping charges by 20%.  You can also call MBS
toll-free at: 800-325-3252.  For more information on shipping charges to
foreign addresses, you can contact MBS at 573-446-5299.  Please know that
the standard shipping time for books is 5 business days so please remember
to order your books as soon as possible before the start of your class.

Step 3: Maintain Your Student ID and Password

Your Student ID and password are your keys to access the Electronic
Classroom.  If you have do not remember or if you have lost your Student
ID and password, please immediately send an e-mail to
techsupport@amunet.edu.

Complete these 3 steps and you'll be on your way to success.  If you have
any questions or need any assistance, please contact the registrar at
(703) 330-5398 ext 104.

Best of luck to you in your courses!

Sincerely,

AMU Office of Student Services & Technology

* if you were a student prior to February 1999, and were allowed to
continue under the old tuition rate, you must still purchase your own book
either through MBS or another book vendor as the AMU Book Grant will not
cover the cost your books.

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Larry

Larry,

In the system we have Allegheny Ludium Corporation and Alleghey Western

So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'  But [Thomas]
said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger
where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe
it.'....
Then [Jesus] said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.'" Thomas said
to him, 'My Lord and my God!'"
John 20:25, 27-28 (NIV)

Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts. Despite his skepticism, Thomas
was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus himself. Some people need to
doubt before they believe. If doubt leads to questions, questions lead to
answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done good work. It is
when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style that
doubt harms faith. When you doubt, don't stop there. Let your doubt deepen
your faith as you continue to search for the answer.

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.  


Thanks,

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

NYMEX/Location/Basis Options

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of
John, do you truly love me more than these?'
'Yes Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
Jesus said, 'Feed my lambs.'...
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' He
said, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.'
John 21:15,  17b (NIV)

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. The first time Jesus said,
"Do you truly love (Greek agape: volitional, self-sacrificial love) me more
than these?" The second time, Jesus focused on Peter alone and still used
the word translated into Greek, phileo (signifying affection, affinity, or
brotherly love) and asked, in effect, "Are you even my friend?" Each time
Peter responded with the word translated into Greek as phileo. Jesus doesn't
settle for quick, superficial answers. He has a way of getting to the heart
of the matter. Peter had to face his true feelings and motives when Jesus
confronted him. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you truly love
me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even his friend?

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <

This past weekend was the MS 150 bike tour from Houston to Austin.  This was 
my third year riding in the event, and it keeps getting better every year.  

We started out bright and early on Saturday morning with some 9,500 other 
riders eager to make the 175 mile trip to Austin.  Team Enron was first out 
of the gate again this year.  The course was more congested than last year 
because of the huge increase in ridership.  The event has been growing 20 
percent each year.  The crowd started to thin out after about 15 miles, and 
it was smooth sailing until lunch in Bellville.  After a quick sandwich, I 
was on my way again to LaGrange.  There were a few more hills this year than 
last, and the wind started to pick up towards the end.  Visions of a cold 
Miller Lite and a relaxing message inspired me onward.  I arrived in LaGrange 
about 1:15, plenty of time to shower and relax in the tent before Enron's 
famous barbecue dinner.

The next morning, we awoke bright and early to the call to the MS Society's 
pancake breakfast.  Getting up at 5am and back on your bike after having 
ridden 100 miles the previous day was no fun task, but everything was fine 
after about 10 miles.  Sunday morning was fairly uneventful until the 
infamous Bastrop State Park with its killer hills.  After the park was lunch, 
then the homestretch to Austin.  This year we had a nice tailwind to help us 
along.    

Last year, with the support of people like you, the Texas MS society raised 
over $3.5 million for multiple sclerosis research.  This year, we will 
certainly break through that goal. Each of us probably know at least one 
person touched by this terrible disease, and this money goes a long way 
towards finding a cure.  

If I haven't already collected your pledge, I'd appreciate it if you'd drop 
it by.  For those of you not on 45, I'll stop by your floor sometime next 
week.  Thank you for your support!  


Brian

John,

VCM is not an eligible swap counterparty.  Until established, we could 
possibly face FERC audit if we opened them up prematurly.  We consider the 
issue a high priority and will let you know when the guaranty comes in.

Subject: OPEC LOG


OPEC LOG: SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10TH

THE AGREEMENT

OPEC will complete deliberations on Monday but for all practical purposes
the deal is done. They have agreed to raise allocations by 800 MB/D on a
prorata basis beginning October 1st. The increase is until the next meeting
which will be November 12th in Vienna. This rather early data was chosen
because of the already scheduled Producer/Consumer Dialogue in Saudi Arabia
November 17-19 and the beginning of Ramadan religious observance beginning
November 27th and lasting for approximately one month. The price band and
OPEC output response mechanism (20 consecutive business days above $28/BBL
basket price, increase output 500 MB/D, 10 consecutive days below $22/BBL
basket, decrease 500 MB/D) will remain in effect with obviously a clean
slate to start the price tracking process.

Saudi Arabia pretty much got its way at the meeting, asking for a 1 MMB/D
increase and compromising on 800 MB/D. Of course the increase is prorata
which implies an increase in the Saudi allocation of 260 MB/D, bringing its
total allocation to about 8.5 MMB/D. Saudi crude output is estimated to have
been almost 8.8 MMB/D in August(including 140 MB/D Abu Safa output produced
on behalf of Bahrain). PIRA expects Saudi Arabia's crude output increase to
be on top of its current over-production bringing total output to nearly 9.1
MMB/D. Since with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all the OPEC
members are essentially at capacity, the 800 MB/D OPEC allocation increase
should translate into a production increase of only around 400 MB/D. Saudi
Arabia and the UAE have allocations equal to 41.2% of the OPEC total(now
26.2 MMB/D excluding Iraq).  With August/September OPEC crude output at
around 29 MMB/D, fourth quarter crude output will be around 29.5 MMB/D
assuming Iraq at 3.0 MMB/D.

MARKET BACKGROUND

Commercial oil inventories remain quite low with the three major OECD
markets--U.S., Europe and Japan-- ending August with the lowest level in
over 10 years. PIRA would not be surprised to see inventories revised up
somewhat for Europe for the end of the second quarter, but this will not
materially change the likely end August position.

In addition to low inventories, the world is operating with very little
spare producing capacity. With OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D in the fourth
quarter, there will only be some 0.5 to 1.0 MMB/D of instant spare producing
capacity remaining. This number will certainly increase in time, but for at
least the first half of the fourth quarter there is not much room for any
interruption in expected supply for any reason (hurricanes, Iraq saber
rattling, earthquakes, etc).

Also, the lead seasonal product distillate(gasoil/diesel) is in great shape
and with substantial refining margins there is plenty of headroom for crude.
Add to the mix very low PADD II crude stocks, positive technicals and
seasonals, at most only ten million barrels of current net speculative
length in the NYMEX crude contract and continued strong economic growth and
you have rather impressive positives for price.

SHORT TERM MARKET BALANCES & PRICES

With fourth quarter OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D, world onshore oil
inventories should draw only 100-200 MB/D in the quarter. Thus assuming
normal early winter weather, stocks will remain very low but not, on
average, decline significantly. For the three major OECD markets, commercial
inventories should end the year 1-2% above the year earlier.

In these circumstances and given the very positive market factors noted
above, it is hard to see oil prices taking a big hit downward as a result of
the OPEC agreement. PIRA would expect the very initial market reaction to be
negative given that the agreed increase is somewhat more than anticipated.
The market will then probably consolidate given that there is a good deal of
confusion about the impact of the agreement. Given the current very strong
fundamentals an upward price bias is likely to quickly return. However, one
major wildcard negative for price first needs to be sorted out.

THE POTENTIAL U.S. SPR SWAP

If the United States is going to use the SPR to swap current barrels from
the strategic reserve to be replaced in the future, the market will find out
this week. With the U.S. Presidential election on November 7th, October
pipeline scheduling completion on September 25th and probably ten days to
carry out an auction, this is the last window of opportunity to have a
meaningful impact before the onset of winter and the election. With SPR
barrels being short haul, as opposed to 45 days away for any incremental
OPEC oil, its impact on oil prices would be far greater than OPEC's current
agreement. Moreover, if the decision is made to use the reserve in this
fashion, the Secretary of Energy is likely to decide to make sure it has the
desired impact of bringing prices down substantially by offering to swap
very substantial volumes. PIRA rates the odds of a swap at 55%.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Joann ---

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at 
Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, 
within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 
MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we 
use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and 
update it daily?

Scott

sounds like a good idea.... id like to know where the author of this lives,  
however, cause its more like $2.00 a gallon here in san diego....  and  
besides, it really is fairly cheap compared to european countries because 
our  
govt subsidizes the entire automobile industry... gas, cars, roadways etc.   
realistically, you should be paying way more than what you currently do.   
maybe its time to start thinking more into alternative sources of  
transportation other that the individual automobile... i can go on with this  
subject regarding all the various societal impacts but i'll cut myself off  
there.  food for thought... 
By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap. Me  
too! As it is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies 
and  
the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of  
gas is CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response.  
With  
the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take  
action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we  
don't buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have  
come to rely on our cars.  But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all  
act together. 
Here's the idea - 
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest  
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If they are not selling, 
they  
should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their prices 
the  
other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to reach literally  
millions of users. 
But it's doable!  I am sending this note to 42 people. If each of you send 
it  
to at least 10 more ... and those 10 send it to at least 10 more and so on 
by

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a 
parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Subject: New Reports from PIRA


To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, "BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market," focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, "THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access," focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to
us at PIRA that the energy marketplace will be forever changed by the demand
for, and creation of, substantial broadband.  What is NOT clear to us at
this time is how we can best assist our clients that are looking to
participate in these developments.  In light of that, we ask that you take a
moment to complete the brief survey that is also attached to this email.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Dr. Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive Officer

Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey
him.'

Daniel 7:27 (NIV)

Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing.
Help us to praise:
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.
"Come, Thou Almighty King" Italian Hymn (c. 1757)

Lord God, we yearn for the day when You will reign.... but we are not
alone. You are with us, beside us, above us, beneath us and within us. We
trust You to see us through to the other side of this troubled time. Stir up
Your Holy Spirit in us so that we can be peacemakers in the midst of
conflict, and sow a harvest of righteousness.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.
