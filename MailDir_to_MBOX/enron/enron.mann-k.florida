I'm trying to clear out some invoices.  I'm processing an invoice for T. Johnston, I think it is around $16k.  If we will continue to have charges from him, these should be paid through Marchris.

I have around 300k to process for Greenburg, most of which relates to Pompano and Deerfield before I was involved.  Please advise if you want to review these before these are paid.

Kay

They are aware that the Broward County Tax Appraiser will assess the property and that as most industrial facilities, the equipment is subject to depreciation.  The City's millage rate has remained fairly constant (stagnant growth), but as the tax base increases, they expect the millage rate to decrease.  The City is looking for a fixed annual revenue stream of $1.5 - 1.726 mm (similar to Pompano's 1.5 mm).
 
After we have all had a chance to review the doc - it would be good to have a conference call to discuss.  We're targetting to get a draft to the City early next week.

Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because millage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the calculation. 

Have they asked for this?

	We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5mm and since ad advalorems will 
decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the 
constant we to increase the 650k at the same rate as the depreciation.

Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would you please clarify the issue for me?

Okay.  I will set up a new LLC (Homestead Development Company, LLC, if available).  Would it be preferable for its sole member to be Lauderdale Land Development Company, LLC or ENA?

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

Subject:	FW: New lease option

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel confident that Voyager is "clean" to use.

I talked to Kay about the new land option Greg will be negotiating this weekend in Homestead.  She said to put the options in the terminal company, not Lauderdale Land, LLC as you had suggested.  Pick one of the other LLCs for me and let me know the name.

Thanks.

Attached are my comments. I've tried to address Kay's concerns below, and 
agree with them wholeheartedly. From a commercial perspective, paragraph 6 is 
a non-starter.

Let's discuss. Thanks.

Subject: Deerfield development agreement

Here are my initial comments:

There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval 
process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re 
landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the 
effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building 
permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the 
time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.

Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for 
the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other 
than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to 
obtain project financing.

Kay

Kay

Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entere=
d into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. ("MDC") and Cooney-Midway=
 Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase).=
  The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given n=
otice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).=
  I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporat=
es changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   =
David Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incor=
porate some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send =
his redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and the=
n send a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week =
or so and then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is i=
n agreement with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that =
Cooney-Midway Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as=
 they own an interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow =
that when we will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vot=
e.  This is because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre=
.  There are three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but=
 the 3rd tract is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped la=
nd for a retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we ju=
st secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those =
and can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft an=
d has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with =
the city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the e=
vening of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send t=
hem a note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out=
 with the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to ke=
ep in mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that w=
ill be approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have =
to negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle f=
or $1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie ha=
s prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has draft=
ed a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any=
 power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The pr=
oblem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air p=
ermit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental P=
rotection ("DEP").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and =
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to reason=
able rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit approvals=
; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated to BC. =
  Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal opin=
ion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something that=
 is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became qui=
te the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass s=
pecial acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but t=
he legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After t=
hat, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a char=
ter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not inconsist=
ent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they repealed =
all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they would =
rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is, the DE=
P has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits for p=
ower plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My recommendation =
is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us get a memo to=
gether, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they don't have th=
e right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is 2 p.m. on Ju=
ne 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers Agreement. =
 Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to the attorn=
ey and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly support us a=
s this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may come to hi=
s senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance will be c=
ostly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DEP to iss=
ue a "declaratory statement" and it is likely that statement would say that=
 state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history inte=
nsive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will come=
 next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the sam=
e who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say=
 over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the =
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's ag=
reement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in Deerfiel=
d.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in lieu of =
taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which is bas=
ically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business coming=
 into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on our p=
roperty.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because if t=
hey are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties, that=
 creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very do-able, =
we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio tower agree=
ments and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a "fire service f=
ee" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of negative publ=
icity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with an editori=
al in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they have bee=
n sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in Deerfield =
is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well. =20

I'll copy my notes for you.  THANK YOU for covering for me.  Here are  numb=
ers you can send e-mails to or call and leave a message:

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Thank you. =20

On the SDEC:=20
this is no longer an '02 play.  To keep it as an '03 play three things need=
 to happen:
(1) we need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the juri=
sdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board ("CZAB") to the Board of Cou=
nty Commissioners.  The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with NIMB=
Y's.  We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after weeks =
of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB, we feel w=
e will be facing sudden death.  However, if we go before the County Commiss=
ioners, we will have a very good chance of success.  The vehicle we propose=
 to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application of Ve=
sted Rights. As I understand it, (I'm getting info on this today), this is =
a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any use=
 of his property.  This application needs to be submitted to the county bef=
ore June 6th, the date of our CZAB hearing.=20
(2) we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of=
 Environmental Resources Management ("DERM") who is responsible for ensurin=
g that the land fill be closed.  They have been pushing the owner of the pr=
operty to initiate the closure work.  The land owner, Certrosa Holdings,  i=
s a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela.   If we wer=
e not in the picture, I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default=
 on the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up =
(at $3 to 4 million). To keep this as an '03 play we will need to get DERM =
to agree to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we wi=
ll need provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get i=
n the chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landf=
ill. We may need to initiate this conversation in the next 2 to 3 weeks.
(3) we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September.=
  The strike price for this property is approximately $1.3 million and we p=
aid $200,000 for a 9 month option last October (when the rules were soft co=
sts could not exceed 5% of the total project cost of $175 million).  Based =
on the success of (1) and (2) above, we may need to initiate this discussio=
n in the next 2 to 3 weeks as well.

On the Medley - Dunn discussions:
As you know, when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns, last month, they =
had two deal breakers: (a) they wanted a committment on our part that we wo=
uld pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax abatemen=
t.  (we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town would not =
involve the Dunns) (b) they wanted us to assume all past and present enviro=
nmental liabilities.  We said no to both conditions and halted discussions.=
  I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns that they =
are considering giving on both these items.  If we structured an arrangemen=
t where we did a phase 2 environmental assessment during a 60 to 90 day "du=
e diligence" period (rather than in an option period or under a 90 day leas=
e), gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the result=
s of the phase 2; and, we change the agreement back to the way it was in th=
e last Andrew &  Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical en=
vironmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise =
in the future but are not the result of our operations.  Would this arrange=
ment give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if necessary =
to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any clean up?=
  If this is something we can work with, we need to have a conversation wit=
h the Dunn's attorney.  What do you think?

      Steve, 
         I sent to you and Kay by email yesterday morning, the initial plan
for the first phase of the discovery process along with time frames for
preparation and a request for authorization to proceed.   We would like to
issue the discovery as soon as reasonably possible after authorization,
given the relatively short time frame until the Pompano Beach hearing.   Kay
wants to discuss the discovery proposal and I expect that we will be doing
so sometime very soon.  (Kay, I am available all afternoon and also
available for most of the day tomorrow).   
        The discovery efforts proposed are independent of DEP.  Thus, we
will not be tied to or delayed by DEP, should the agency fail to undertake
the discovery that is needed.   Ryan Reetz of my office will be the lead
attorney responsible for that effort.   The petitioning municipalities and
Broward County agencies will likely conduct their own discovery, which may
include seeking to depose  Enron's experts and/or an Enron corporate
representative.   
        With respect to our experts, I had previously asked that Dave
Kellermeyer identify certain expert witnesses that we may need to sustain
the issuance of the permit.   By copy of this email, I am asking that Dave
contact me to advise me of the status of his efforts to date.         
          I hope that the foregoing answered all of your questions but
please advise me if I can be of further assistance. 
         --Kerri

the DOAH website.   The first is a Notice of Hearing, including all of the
logistical information on the four-day hearing commencing on October 29th
and concluding on November 1st.   The second is the order of Pre-hearing
Instructions, which is typically issued along with the Notice of Hearing.
The Pre-hearing Notice is primarily directed to legal counsel for the
parties, requiring that such counsel confer fifteen days prior to the date
of the final hearing to prepare a pre-hearing stipulation, discuss the
possibility of settlement, examine exhibits and otherwise prepare for the
hearing.
             Please call me if you have any questions on the attachments.

      Steve and Dave,
            I just spoke with Martha directly and she advised me that there
is not a meeting on Tuesday with DEP air staff.   Martha indicated that she
could not confirm everyone's availability for the meeting and that there was
no need for the meeting at this time.   When I questioned her concerning why
she felt that there was no need for the meeting, Martha indicated that she
was not in the position to address the 36 ppm NOx limitation presently
without discussion with Howard, the head of the air division, and that she
tried to reach Howard four or five times yesterday to no avail.  Martha
would not give me any time that she thought that we might be able to meet,
saying that it would create  false expectations.    Martha noted that her
boss and others in her area will be out most of next week and that she
honestly could not tell me when she thought that DEP would be able to
discuss its position on the  NOx limitation, although she thought that it
might take two or three weeks.  
           She impliedly suggested that we should not be in such a rush for
the meeting, given that a modification of the permit condition would require
a complete re-opening of the process, including notice, public meeting and
the like (approximate 60 day deferral).   I indicated to her that we wanted
to meet to discuss DEP's position on the NOx limitation and, if DEP agreed
that we had met our burden concerning the 42 ppm, then we wanted to discuss
the potential avenues available for minimizing any loss in hearing time (for
example, by publishing the amended notice as soon as possible, stipulating
that the existing parties could amend their petitions to add in any new
allegations and stipulating that any new parties may join the existing
proceeding).  
            Martha indicated that the permit evaluation process is not under
her control and that she is waiting to meet with Howard to address the
issue.   Martha then  suggested that additional environmental analysis may
be required and that EPA may need to become involved.   I mentioned to her
that the existing intent to issue appears to be based upon the impacts
associated with the 42 ppm NOx limitation and that I was unclear why
additional impact analysis would be necessary.   I also nicely reminded
Martha that DEP has already issued a permit with the 42 ppm NOx limit and
that the Pompano Beach permit has the same limitation.   Martha told me that
she has not yet seen the letter to Al Linero that was sent on August 10th
within the comment period and I promised to send it to her today by
facsimile (which my secretary has already done).   With respect to her
comment about EPA,  I can only speculate that Al or other representative of
the air permitting staff wants additional comfort and may seek EPA's
involvement.   Dave and Steve, I am interested in your thoughts in that
respect.    
           Finally,  Martha knew all of the specifics of the meeting with
Teri in Tallahassee on Monday.   She  knew the subject of the meeting and
that Ron Laface had requested the meeting.   I suspect that Pat Comer has
briefed her.   I also suspect that Pat is directing Martha with respect to
the meeting that we were trying to schedule on Tuesday.    
          Sorry for the length of this email but I hope that it is
informative.  All for now but please contact  me if I can be of additional
assistance. --  Kerri

I'm on a 2 hour conference call, so it seems like a good time to write up some of what I know.

I started working on these projects in late May, when Ann Elizabeth went on vacation, so I don't have much history.

Here are the projects which have some activity.

Broward County projects:
These are politically sensitive projects, with what I consider to be a relatively high burn rate on outside legal fees.

I've worked on two of these projects.  

The current active one is called Deerfield Beach. Steve Krimsky is the developer.  We have a land option (Mancini) and a development agreement with the City. The DEP has indicated an indication of its intent to issue an air permit.  Neighboring communities are protesting (quite literally), and the matter has been referred to an administrative law judge, and a hearing is expected in October.  In addition, the communities have sued the City of Deerfield Beach for permitting the development.  We are at the decision point of whether to intervene, which I expect we will.  Richard Sanders is up-to-speed on this, but is not following this.

In late September a sizable payment will be due to the City.  Ben is evaluating whether to drop this one.  If the decision is to continue, he expects to DASH (or I think DASH LITE) the project.  I'm getting estimates on the legal fees to get this and Pompano over the goal line. I estimate the legal fees burn rate to be around $300k per month, with the potential to escalate.  Greenberg Traurig is our outside counsel, and as best I can tell they've been "managed" by Steve.  I believe he maintains an office in their office.  The bills have been going to Barbara, so I just interjected myself in the process.  of invoices.

I recently learned that the county is suing to condemn part of the property.  The price they are offering is less than our purchase price, and getting this settled quickly is critical to getting the plat issues so that we can move forward.  Commercially, we are willing to make up the difference, the question being how. We want to extend the option past its current May 01 expiration.  Steve says he thinks that doing a lease would serve commercial purposes better (less initial outlay).

The water contract will be up on the radar screen shortly. We want to use reclaimed water from the county wastewater treatment facility.  That contract will be negotiated with the developer friendly part of the County, but it will need to be approved by the county commissioners.

Speaking of the county, Broward County has enacted a moratorium on power plant development until May 02 (I think that dates right).  Our local lawyers say "they can't do that" (that cost us $80k), but they did.  

I have requested that GT prepare an explanation of the steps necessary to get all the approvals, with the overlapping timeframes. This is in connection with the fee estimate request.

Pompano Beach

This project has been announced as cancelled, but there are rumblings of a revival.


Certosa Holdings

This project was cancelled, but ITS BACK.  We will let the balance sheet unfriendly option expire, and will enter into a balance sheet friendly option.  The land owner is a single asset company owned by a Cuban national living in Venezuela.  It was formerly a land fill, and needs to be reclaimed, the cost of which exceeds the value of the land.

There are outstanding zoning issues on this one.  We tried to get around the local zoning board with a technical argument, but now they are enacting an ordinance which will require it.  Ben's current plans are to get the new option and get this in shape to mothball until the tide turns.

Greg Krause is the developer.  He is fine to work with.

Homestead.

I think this is new.  We are negotiating an option. Very young project as best I can tell.

Midway

This one is fairly far along, and I'm not aware of any significant permitting/approval issues.  We are finishing up a property owner's association agreement, and working on an interconnect agreement.  We will need a water supply agreement in the near future. Another Greg Krause deal.

I'm also working with Ben on the sell of the project to TECO (same lawyer as the last TECO deal I worked on).  We have a LOI and draft purchase contract which is going out to TECO this week.  I expect that I can still support this one since it is getting to the end.

This gives an overview of what I've been working on in the past couple of weeks.

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling		011-49-8218-89351	schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher	011-49-8232-8932	m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Kay

Here is an overview of what projects are active:

1.  Midway - Greg Krause

The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entered 
into between Midway Development Company, L.L.C. ("MDC") and Cooney-Midway 
Groves (the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase).  
The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given 
notice it will proceed with the project (and, thus, we control the trigger).  
I have asked Chris Boehler at A&K to turn a redline draft that incorporates 
changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff.   David 
Layman at Greenburg Traurig (our Florida counsel) also needs to incorporate 
some changes now that the platting has been done.  Chris is to send his 
redline to Greg, David and you.  David is to make his additions and then send 
a composite to Greg, you and Chris.  This will probably take a week or so and 
then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is in agreement 
with the changes.  The biggest issue we have right now is that Cooney-Midway 
Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an 
interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we 
will own 2/3 of the property but have less than 1/2 of the vote.  This is 
because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre.  There are 
three tracts, of which CM will own one and MDC will own 2, but the 3rd tract 
is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped land for a 
retention pond.

Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we just 
secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman.  There's no rush on those and 
can definitely wait until I get back.

2.  Pompano - Steve Krimsky

Pompano has 2 issues that are hot.

1.  The infamous Developer's Agreement.  Debbie has turned another draft and 
has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the 
city attorney on Friday.  The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the evening 
of June 12 and you have indicated that you will attend.  I'll send them a 
note to tell them you'll be there.  We need to have a deal worked out with 
the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting.  The thing to keep in 
mind here is that in Pompano, unlike Deerfield, the same group that will be 
approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to 
negotiate the developer's agreement with.  Allegedly, they will settle for 
$1.5 MM in annual payments.  I've laid a copy of the agreement Debbie has 
prepared on your chair.

2.  In an effort to block the power plant project, Broward County has drafted 
a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any 
power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length.  The 
problem is, they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air 
permit process.  That is expressly delegated to the Dept. of Environmental 
Protection ("DEP").    However, the DEP hasn't taken the clean approach and 
said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to 
reasonable rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit 
approvals; HOWEVER, air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated 
to BC.   Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal 
opinion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something 
that is legally defensible.  Once they started looking into this, it became 
quite the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass 
special acts. However, in 1977 their special act authority was cut off but 
the legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time.  After 
that, they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a 
charter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not 
inconsistent with state or federal law or the constitution.  In 2000, they 
repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they 
would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules.  Problem is, 
the DEP has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits 
for power plants.  Needless to say, this is sticky and icky.  My 
recommendation is that we don't jump out and incur litigation costs.  Let us 
get a memo together, go talk to the county attorney and show him that they 
don't have the right to do this.  The hearing on adopting this ordinance is 2 
p.m. on June 12, same day as the commissioner's meeting on the Developers 
Agreement.  Between now and June 12, Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to 
the attorney and to the DEP.  Indications are that the DEP will strongly 
support us as this could be a turf battle for them.  The county attorney may 
come to his senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance 
will be costly as it is unenforceable if challenged.  We can also ask the DEP 
to issue a "declaratory statement" and it is likely that statement would say 
that state law is pre-emptive and the ordinance is invalid.

This is a very, very broad brush of what is a very legislative history 
intensive issue.  Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will 
come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward.

3.  Deerfield - Steve Krimsky

Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the same 
who vote on the developer's agreement, in Deerfield they don't have a say 
over any of the approval process.  However, to facilitate coming into the 
city, they expect something.  If we can agree on the form of developer's 
agreement, then it would be substantially used in the same manner in 
Deerfield.  In Deerfield, they have said they want 3 things:  a payment in 
lieu of taxes, a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street (which 
is basically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business 
coming into Deerfield) and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on 
our property.  I've told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because 
if they are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties, 
that creates a lot of traffic going across your property.  It is very 
do-able, we just need to structure it correctly. I've done several radio 
tower agreements and we can use those as go-bys.  They may also want a "fire 
service fee" if we give one to Pompano.  There's also lots and lots of 
negative publicity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with 
an editorial in the Sun-Sentinel.  I'll forward the most recent version they 
have been sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers.  The hearing in 
Deerfield is June 8th and you may want to attend it as well.  

I'll copy my notes for you.  THANK YOU for covering for me.  Here are  
numbers you can send e-mails to or call and leave a message:

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011 49 8218 89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011 49 8232 8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak pretty good 
English and Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena doesn't speak it very well so ask 
for Walter.  Bavaria is 7 hours ahead of Houston.

Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get 
into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect 
study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using 
the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying 
that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option 
agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it 
has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time 
we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are 
ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would 
you please clarify the issue for me?

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old 
stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid 
for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According 
to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old 
interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel 
confident that Voyager is "clean" to use.

Thank you.  

On the SDEC: 
this is no longer an '02 play.  To keep it as an '03 play three things need 
to happen:
(1) we need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the 
jurisdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board ("CZAB") to the Board of 
County Commissioners.  The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with 
NIMBY's.  We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after 
weeks of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB, we 
feel we will be facing sudden death.  However, if we go before the County 
Commissioners, we will have a very good chance of success.  The vehicle we 
propose to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application 
of Vested Rights. As I understand it, (I'm getting info on this today), this 
is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any 
use of his property.  This application needs to be submitted to the county 
before June 6th, the date of our CZAB hearing. 
(2) we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of 
Environmental Resources Management ("DERM") who is responsible for ensuring 
that the land fill be closed.  They have been pushing the owner of the 
property to initiate the closure work.  The land owner, Certrosa Holdings,  
is a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela.   If we were 
not in the picture, I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on 
the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up (at $3 
to 4 million). To keep this as an '03 play we will need to get DERM to agree 
to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we will need 
provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get in the 
chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landfill. We 
may need to initiate this conversation in the next 2 to 3 weeks.
(3) we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September.  
The strike price for this property is approximately $1.3 million and we paid 
$200,000 for a 9 month option last October (when the rules were soft costs 
could not exceed 5% of the total project cost of $175 million).  Based on the 
success of (1) and (2) above, we may need to initiate this discussion in the 
next 2 to 3 weeks as well.

On the Medley - Dunn discussions:
As you know, when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns, last month, they 
had two deal breakers: (a) they wanted a committment on our part that we 
would pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax 
abatement.  (we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town 
would not involve the Dunns) (b) they wanted us to assume all past and 
present environmental liabilities.  We said no to both conditions and halted 
discussions.  I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns 
that they are considering giving on both these items.  If we structured an 
arrangement where we did a phase 2 environmental assessment during a 60 to 90 
day "due diligence" period (rather than in an option period or under a 90 day 
lease), gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the 
results of the phase 2; and, we change the agreement back to the way it was 
in the last Andrew &  Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical 
environmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise 
in the future but are not the result of our operations.  Would this 
arrangement give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if 
necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any 
clean up?  If this is something we can work with, we need to have a 
conversation with the Dunn's attorney.  What do you think?

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy

Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Steve and Ben,

I received a current statement of the open matters we have with GT.  In rough numbers it is around $270,000 for all the Florida work, excluding Ft. P.  Most files only have one month worth of billing, so it gives us a bit of a feel for the order of magnitude of the burn rate.  What I don't know is if the burn rate is increasing or decreasing.  With the litigation, the moratorium and the DEP proceedings, an escalation wouldn't surprise me.

Unfortunately, we don't have an estimate yet on the whole package, including the moratorium ($80,000 bill for June) and  the land use/environmental work ($44k in June for Deerfield, $71k for Pompano).  I would like to get you a more comprehensive picture of what we can expect in the next couple of months.  

Kay

Ben,

Attached are GT's views/scenarios regarding the Deerfield / Coconut Creek law suit.  Bottom line - total estimated max cost ~$150k should a trial not be required and upwards to ~$250k+ should a full blown trial occur.

GT expects to have a timeline later in the week for the various scenarios.

Deerfield is planning to submit the motion to dismiss tomorrow, which is the 20 day deadline.  The dismissal hearing is tentatively planned for August 14th.  Deerfield wants Enron to intervene as soon as possible so as to be in a position to participate in the dismissal hearing.

Upon Enron's request to intervene, the judge typically requires 5 business days to set the intervention hearing.  Working backwards, assuming the dismissal hearing is scheduled for the 14th, the intervention hearing should take place on the 13th at the latest, which will require an intervention request be filed no later than Monday the 6th.

GT is awaiting approval to proceed, and if possibly, would like to file the motion to intervene on Friday.

Lets talk tomorrow - I'll get Lorie to schedule a time.  

Steve

Ben,

I know you want to put Certosa Holdings on the back burner for a while but 
unfortunately we can't stop the process unless we withdrawal our request for 
unusual use permit.   If we do so, we can not re-submit for 18 months.   
Since the application was submitted in the name of Certosa Holdings, if the 
property is conveyed to another entity, it may be possible to re-submit under 
this new entity.  I've asked Kay to look into the possibility if throwing 
Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  I have not heard back but here are my 
thoughts:
 (1) We are not a creditor and therefore we may not have the ability to put 
CH in bankruptcy
 (2) If we can deem CH in default of the option agreement,  one of the 
remedies is reimbursement.  Since CH is illiquid, we would automatically be a 
creditor with the       ability to throw them into bankruptcy
 (3) Once in bankruptcy, I don't know what would happen.  There are no 
secured creditors and we would be the only unsecured creditor.  
 (4) Whether bankruptcy would halt the unusual use permit approval process or 
not, I do not know. 
Until we determine if bankruptcy helps, us we have no choice but to proceed.

I estimate the burn rate will be between $50,000 and $60,000 per month 
through October.  This is broken down into four types of costs:
 (a) lobbyists: $17,000 per month from June through October plus $210,000 in 
success fees if we get project approval from the commissioners.
 (b) yet to be negotiated option consideration:  $20k to $35k to Certosa 
Holdings as well as an adjacent property owner looking for a buyout
 (c) land fill closure related activities: $35,000 (ground water testing, 
fencing the property and funding assistance to get $800,000 of bond money 
released to reimburse       closure costs)
 (d) Consultants and lawyers: $23,000 per month

  
As you know we are now out of the jurisdiction of the CZAB and in the 
jurisdiction of the Board of County Commissioners.  Below is a summary of 
where we are and where we need to go.  Please let me know when you have a few 
minutes to discuss this project.

Renew or New Option Agreement:
We need to renegotiate the Option Agreement with Certosa Holdings:  Rather 
than giving CH a chunk of money that could disappear immediately, I'd like to 
structure an arrangement where we fund, as long as the Option Agreement is in 
effect (we don't terminate before expiration), some landfill closure work.  
This benefits both Enron and CH as DERM will be more amenable to amending the 
Consent Agreement that sets out the time table of closure if they can see 
some progress.  I an trying to get with Kay to discuss alternatives.  We need 
to be aware that CH could file bankruptcy sooner or later.  I checked the 
Option Agreement and unlike some of the other agreements, this one does not 
appear to have bankruptcy as a default.  If we have to give CH anything I 
would want to give him only a nominal amount of money;  $25k max

Option on adjacent property:
As referenced above, we (Kerri) have been contacted  by an attorney 
representing a property owner adjacent to the CH site who may be looking for 
a buy out.  The property is wetlands and should be relatively cheap 
considering it is useless.

Unusual Use Permit Application and Claim of Taking:
We expect to present the project and argue the taking issue before the 
Development of Impact Committee ("DIC") in July.  This is a committee of 
County Department heads.  They will make a recommendation to the Board of 
County Commissioners who will hear the merits of the project and decide on 
whether to approve the project.  Only if they reject the project does the 
taking issue come into play.  I will work to target the Board of County 
Commissioners hearing for October.  

You are aware of the ordinance we propose to discuss with the Commissioners.  
I'd like to talk to you about this when you have time. 

DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management) issues:
When we executed this option agreement, we fully expected CH to have closed 
the landfill by now.  Obviously things have changed.  

We (Kerri, Valorie Settles of Shutts & Bowen and I) met DERM last week.  DERM 
is willing to consider revising the Consent Agreement and the schedule of 
closing the landfill.  We discussed creating a 3 phase closure.  the first 
phase would be the easy (cheap) stuff as discussed above.  The second phase 
would be more expensive and may include removal of a pile of wood for $171k 
and or removal of exotics from the wetlands for $83k.  The second phase would 
be times to occur after we received County Commissioners approval for the 
Unusual Use Permit.  The third phase would be the very expensive stuff ($ 
millions) and would be timed to be when we expect to exercise the option.

Consultant Agreements for Lobbyists:
We have been working with one lobbyist, whose contract expired at the end of 
May.  Another, a former chief of staff of the commissionwer whose district 
the project is in, publishes a newspaper called the Gospel Truth, which 
recently published an article about the project and the need for power

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Hi Gang, 

In getting ready for vacation, I've fallen behind on my phone calls.  Therefore, I'm sending an email.

As Steve may have told you by now, you do have authorization to file the intervention in the CC lawsuit and join in the Motion to Dismiss.  Once we see how that goes, we will discuss strategy and further activities.

Debbie, I will try to call you tomorrow am so that we can discuss the moratorium issues and get at least a short term game plan.  It will be before noon central, as I'm on the plane at that point.

Ben, Steve and I have had a couple of discussions, and we have agreed that on a going forward basis, I will need to be involved in all strategy decisions and decisions impacting our legal fees.  Obviously, this does not go to the point of needing permission to handle to routine matters, but does involve needing approval before engaging in legal research, preparing motions and conducting discovery.  It is Enron's policy to enforce this by disallowing any fees and expenses not approved in advance.  I know it sounds harsh, but I believe it is workable given the team we have working for us.  

I would be glad to hear any suggestions you might have regarding cost containment.

Again, pardon the abruptness of this email, but I want to get the info to you as soon as possible.  We appreciate your efforts on behalf of Enron, and look forward to our mutual success.

Kay

Ben,

I know you want to put Certosa Holdings on the back burner for a while but unfortunately we can't stop the process unless we withdrawal our request for unusual use permit.   If we do so, we can not re-submit for 18 months.   Since the application was submitted in the name of Certosa Holdings, if the property is conveyed to another entity, it may be possible to re-submit under this new entity.  I've asked Kay to look into the possibility if throwing Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  I have not heard back but here are my thoughts:
	(1) We are not a creditor and therefore we may not have the ability to put CH in bankruptcy
	(2) If we can deem CH in default of the option agreement,  one of the remedies is reimbursement.  Since CH is illiquid, we would automatically be a creditor with the 	     ability to throw them into bankruptcy
	(3) Once in bankruptcy, I don't know what would happen.  There are no secured creditors and we would be the only unsecured creditor.  
	(4) Whether bankruptcy would halt the unusual use permit approval process or not, I do not know. 
Until we determine if bankruptcy helps, us we have no choice but to proceed.

I estimate the burn rate will be between $50,000 and $60,000 per month through October.  This is broken down into four types of costs:
	(a) lobbyists: $17,000 per month from June through October plus $210,000 in success fees if we get project approval from the commissioners.
	(b) yet to be negotiated option consideration:  $20k to $35k to Certosa Holdings as well as an adjacent property owner looking for a buyout
	(c) land fill closure related activities: $35,000 (ground water testing, fencing the property and funding assistance to get $800,000 of bond money released to reimburse 	     closure costs)
	(d) Consultants and lawyers: $23,000 per month

  
As you know we are now out of the jurisdiction of the CZAB and in the jurisdiction of the Board of County Commissioners.  Below is a summary of where we are and where we need to go.  Please let me know when you have a few minutes to discuss this project.

Renew or New Option Agreement:
We need to renegotiate the Option Agreement with Certosa Holdings:  Rather than giving CH a chunk of money that could disappear immediately, I'd like to structure an arrangement where we fund, as long as the Option Agreement is in effect (we don't terminate before expiration), some landfill closure work.  This benefits both Enron and CH as DERM will be more amenable to amending the Consent Agreement that sets out the time table of closure if they can see some progress.  I an trying to get with Kay to discuss alternatives.  We need to be aware that CH could file bankruptcy sooner or later.  I checked the Option Agreement and unlike some of the other agreements, this one does not appear to have bankruptcy as a default.  If we have to give CH anything I would want to give him only a nominal amount of money;  $25k max

Option on adjacent property:
As referenced above, we (Kerri) have been contacted  by an attorney representing a property owner adjacent to the CH site who may be looking for a buy out.  The property is wetlands and should be relatively cheap considering it is useless.

Unusual Use Permit Application and Claim of Taking:
We expect to present the project and argue the taking issue before the Development of Impact Committee ("DIC") in July.  This is a committee of County Department heads.  They will make a recommendation to the Board of County Commissioners who will hear the merits of the project and decide on whether to approve the project.  Only if they reject the project does the taking issue come into play.  I will work to target the Board of County Commissioners hearing for October.  

You are aware of the ordinance we propose to discuss with the Commissioners.  I'd like to talk to you about this when you have time. 

DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management) issues:
When we executed this option agreement, we fully expected CH to have closed the landfill by now.  Obviously things have changed.  

We (Kerri, Valorie Settles of Shutts & Bowen and I) met DERM last week.  DERM is willing to consider revising the Consent Agreement and the schedule of closing the landfill.  We discussed creating a 3 phase closure.  the first phase would be the easy (cheap) stuff as discussed above.  The second phase would be more expensive and may include removal of a pile of wood for $171k and or removal of exotics from the wetlands for $83k.  The second phase would be times to occur after we received County Commissioners approval for the Unusual Use Permit.  The third phase would be the very expensive stuff ($ millions) and would be timed to be when we expect to exercise the option.

Consultant Agreements for Lobbyists:
We have been working with one lobbyist, whose contract expired at the end of May.  Another, a former chief of staff of the commissionwer whose district the project is in, publishes a newspaper called the Gospel Truth, which recently published an article about the project and the need for power

Greg:
I have a couple of comments on Article 15 Insurance.

It appears that most of my changes were entered but I see a couple of modifications still needed.

15.1 is titled "Customer's Insurance" but the paragraph below it discuss 'each Party" so this needs to be changed so the title refers to the list of insurance requirements below and the title refers to the whole article.

15.3 in the fifth line delete "coverage, coverage for" and in the sixth line delete "and".

15.4 in the third line delete "of".

15.6.1 in the third line a space is needed between "policies" and "are".

I believe that is all that is needed. Please let me know what FPL's response is.
Paul

Please find attached the Midway IA redlined to show the differences between the generic and the project specific draft and also showing the comments I've collected to date   Please note that the comments were added by changing the font and format rather than by using the track/highlight changes function.  

As you know we had scheduled a call with FPL for tomorrow.  Since we have not sent FPL our comments, I suggested to Tom Sanders of FPL that we postpone the call until Monday. This is assuming we get them our comments to them tomorrow.  If that is not possible, we may need to push the call back further.   hope that redlining and consolidating the comments will help with your review.   

Please provide me with any additional comments at your earliest convenience.

Ben,

Attached are GT's views/scenarios regarding the Deerfield / Coconut Creek law suit.  Bottom line - total estimated max cost ~$150k should a trial not be required and upwards to ~$250k+ should a full blown trial occur.

GT expects to have a timeline later in the week for the various scenarios.

Deerfield is planning to submit the motion to dismiss tomorrow, which is the 20 day deadline.  The dismissal hearing is tentatively planned for August 14th.  Deerfield wants Enron to intervene as soon as possible so as to be in a position to participate in the dismissal hearing.

Upon Enron's request to intervene, the judge typically requires 5 business days to set the intervention hearing.  Working backwards, assuming the dismissal hearing is scheduled for the 14th, the intervention hearing should take place on the 13th at the latest, which will require an intervention request be filed no later than Monday the 6th.

GT is awaiting approval to proceed, and if possibly, would like to file the motion to intervene on Friday.

Lets talk tomorrow - I'll get Lorie to schedule a time.  

Steve

 <<ENRONPOMPANOMOTION TO STRIKE AND DISMISS PETITIONS FOR FORMAL
ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING_v1.DOC>> 
Dear Team Enron Pompano Beach:

Attached is our motion to strike and/or dismiss Coral Springs' second
amended petition.  Because the petition is substantially the same as those
previously submitted in this action and in the Deerfield action, you will
recognize our motion to dismiss arguments.  

A new argument appears, however, on the first five pages of the motion
wherein we argue that it was improper for Coral Springs to have submitted a
second amended petition well past the DEP's imposed deadline.  We ask the
administrative law judge to accordingly strike the second amended petition
and refuse to consider it.

We would like to send this out this evening for filing with DOAH tomorrow.
Please forward any comments or suggestions you have by the close of business
today, if possible.  

Thank you very much,

Kay,

Unfortunately, I don't have an electronic version of the option agreement.  
Kathleen Carnahan will get you a hard copy "right now".

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

   Rand,
         I concur with Steve's question relative to whether there are any
unacceptable provisions in the draft, "draft" permit or the need for any
modifications.   I also agree with Steve that we should anticipate an
administrative challenge to the permit by   Coconut Creek or other such
municipality.    In light of such a potential challenge, please contact me
to discuss any weaknesses in the proposed permit.
         Thanks !  Kerri

B each ERP


The discharge into Independence Lake might be challenged by Indy
Bay/Waterways/etc. - the existing agreement only allows ~2/3 of the
property to drain to the lake.  I agree with your assessment of
sufficiency/standing, however, Coconut Creek has been and most likely
will continue to be relentless in their pursuit to delay the project.

Are there any recommended changes to the draft?  

Please keep the team apprised when the 30-day clock starts.

Thanks,
Steve

Thanks for the very helpful email.  What do you think of our chances of fending off Broward County's intervention?  Seems like a judge would be likely to let them in, with the thought that they can always dismiss them later.  I guess I've never seen a motion to intervene denied, but then again, I've never seen this kind of motion to intervene.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Kay:

Thank you for all the emails, welcome back, and I'm glad you are back.
Anything I say here is subject to Kerri's approval / modification.  In
response to your concerns:

1.	Pompano / Broward Intervention.  I do not believe resisting
intervention by Broward is a waste of time and money.  They have more
resources and better lawyers than the municipalities and have a greater
capability to beat up on us along the way and at the hearing.  The only
benefit I know of allowing them in is there has been some discussion of
raising and litigating the Broward permitting authority question in the DOAH
proceeding.  If you wanted to do that, however, you could do so in the
Deerfield case where Broward is an established party.


2.	Pompano / Appeal of Denial of Motions to Dismiss.  Taking this
appeal could constitute a waste of time and money.  I am an appellate lawyer
by trade and know that the standard for review of the denial of a motion to
dismiss is extremely deferential and nearly impossible to overturn on
appeal.  The only upside of taking the appeal is that it would delay the
Pompano proceeding, which could possibly be beneficial if the Deerfield
proceeding progressed to a successful conclusion in the meantime.  Our
standing arguments in the motions to dismiss are well-researched and
well-preserved so the lion's share of the work for the appellate brief is
done if you decided to do it.


3.	Pompano / Planned Motion to Strike.  Our next move in the DOAH
proceedings was to work with Martha at DEP on a joint motion to strike
certain of the claims in the petitions that were clearly and obviously way
off base.  For instance, there is an allegation about NEPA requirements
which is absolutely irrelevant to DEP air permit issuance.  The goal here is
to seek to narrow the issues for the hearing and for discovery.  This may be
something you want to stop in the interest of cost containment.  It is a way
to get a second bite at dismissing some of the claims and it presents an
opportunity for us and DEP to present a unified front on something, finally.
I will defer to Kerri on what she advises on the motion to strike.      


Let me know if I can provide anything further to help in your supervision of
our DOAH efforts,

I'm working my way through emails, and see that we lost on our motion to

Attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the title and
survey issues memo I have prepared, which sets forth certain title and
survey issues related to the St. Lucie County site, and also sets forth
what work, if any, we are undertaking to resolve the issues.  In
addition, attached for your review please find one (1) copy of the
initial draft of the title and survey objection letter for the St. Lucie
County site.  The issues set forth in the memo and letter are relatively
minor in nature, as our review of the title and survey documents did not
reveal any issues of which were particularly unusual.  With respect to
the financing issues as they relate to the attached documents, I am not
at all certain whether they have been evaluated from this perspective,
and I am also not certain if they have any impact at all on said issues.

Once you have had an opportunity to review the attachments, please call
me with any questions or comments you may have.  Once the objection
letter is in final form, I will forward same to the optionor.

Best regards,

Chris Boehler

Additionally, have these been evaluated in light of Enron's balance

Debbie,

Could we discuss this before we start spending money?  I'm a bit uncomfortable drafting something that we aren't sure we want to use.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject:	Declaratory Statement to DEP regarding County Moratorium


Although we are not yet entirely comfortable with the Declaratory Statement
alternative to addressing the County moratorium, we need to prepare the
necessary petition so that should we get a positive read from DEP later this
month we are ready to file immediately.  Toward that end, and given various
vacation schedules, Barbara has asked that Mike you start drafting the
petition so that when she is back from vacation on August 8 and before I
leave on August 9 we have a draft to review.  Then, Ron you and I can plan
to meet with DEP staff the week of August 27 when I return to the office,
unless you can get to the appropriate persons before that and get the task
of pre-clearing that they will give us the answer we are looking for.  We
also need to coordinate with Kerri since she is taking the lead on the
pending administrative hearings on the Enron air permits and there may be an
opportunity to address the exclusive authority of DEP over air permitting
for power plants through that litigation, Kerri please evaluate this issue
and let us know what you think.

We are endeavoring to have the Deerfield site positioned for a building
permit in the first quarter of 2002 and need to address these issues in
order to achieve that goal.

If the time frames outlined above create a problem for anyone let me know
asap.  Thanks.

Mike, I have attached all the memoranda Barbara has been preparing on the
moratorium issue to assist you, should you need any back ground
documentation please let me know and we will locate it for you since Barbara
is away for a week.

The file number for the Enron/Moratorium matter is 42292.011000.

When the 3 of you are happy with the form, send it out.  I'll review in more detail once we hear back from the owner.  Please don't have another lawyer approve it while I'm gone based on my review thus far, as I want to give it some more thought.  Plus, it will need to go to Accounting and possibly Finance.  

Thanks,

Kay

Subject:	Revised Draft of the proposed new Homestead Option

Attached is the a redline of the revised Homestead Option.  This redline is against the one provided by Alger's attorney and includes all of your suggested changes.  The deal has changed to obtain an option on 5.0 acres; purchase price, firm at $1,100,000.00 and Option Payments at $11,000.  I have highlighted two areas (Sections 6 and 14) that still need to be addressed.  Please advise of any additional changes.

I agree with your & Kay's comments.
 
Section 6 "Free Opiton" is nothing more than a wish the City put on the table for the first time this past Wednesday.  They have no intention of creating a utility nor do they envision being a power marketer.  I agree - omit it from the draft.
 
The City is envisioning there is a possiblity the facilty will be expanded in the future (which is what Coastal has been discussing with them regarding their phased SC/CC approach), and as such, is willing to have future expansion language in the doc (Debbie's 4b).  The City's position is that there are no guarantees the facility will be given the approvals in the future for expansion (new commission, change of law, etc) and that the language might be of some benefit.  Should we elect to remain quiet, they will agree.
 
The City is looking for an initial up front payment of $1.5mm this September 01, which was Pompano's initial position as well - another wishful thought.  I agree with the proposed changes to 3 "prior to the end of the calendar year in which DBEC received its building permit" the payment will be made.
 
Steve

Kay / Steve: 

Attached are my comments. I've tried to address Kay's concerns below, and agree with them wholeheartedly. From a commercial perspective, paragraph 6 is a non-starter.

Let's discuss. Thanks.

Subject:        Deerfield development agreement 

	Here are my initial comments: 

	There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.

	Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to obtain project financing.

	Kay
