The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market.

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.  After seeking opinions from various business people, the overwhelming conclusion was to work with the Estate prior to entering business school in the fall.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

Dear Mr Lavorato,
 
I am writing you to express my dissapointment about how the whole A/A issue with UBS was handled. I have been working for a year as an Analyst in the Gas Risk Management Group. In that period I learned a lot  about risk and  trading, and eventhough sometimes we worked crazy hours, I thought I had this incredible job, and I  worked with the best people in the industry. How few of us get a chance like that?! I was looking forward to my next rotation in the origination group, when the whole Enron scandal started happening. 
 
Even when we filed the bankruptcy, I still knew that the trading group will survive, and I was right. But I never thought that the management will so easily forget about the analysts, and not even try to negotiate analysts salaries with UBS , that all of us knew were the lowest in the market. And I am completely sure, UBS knew that too, but why would they pay us more, when our own management did not stand behind us. I remember the times when I was working till 11:00 p.m  or sometimes even longer, but since I had this incredible group of people to work with, I always thought someone would recognize that. But it looks like that it does not matter anymore how much you work, but who do you know?!
 
Mr. Lavorato, I wanted to share this with you because I know that you can make  a difference and that you always cared about the A/A program. Eventhough it may be late for me, it would be a great loss for the company if all  these smart people start leaving. Many of them are the brightest individuals I ever met, and I think they are the future of UBS Trading Group. I hope that you will at least think about what I said, because I know that you have a lot on your mind. 
 
I wish you a lot of success in this year!
 
Sincerely,
Anna Kulic
Gas Risk Management

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

We are scheduled to meet with Mike Hutchins and John Costas in Stamford on Friday.  Tammie is co-ordinating the trip but essentially there is no current plan for Thursday night but we will need to be there in time for an early start on Friday.  On Friday each of us will meet with John and Mike, have lunch, tour the facilities etc then depart.

That's all I know - Tammie is trying to get more details.

Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
 
Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

B list

11 of 12 signed (Milnthorp verbal acceptance)

C list

68 of 105 signed (13 verbal acceptances subject to docs - puts us at 81). Target is 84.

You mentioned this morning we can swap out names in this group. If so here are names that are definite no's from C list:

Aucoin, Berney	(potential replacement Jim Brysch)
Badeer, Robert
Choi, Paul
Conch, Charles
Coulter, Edwin
Gupta, Gautam
Herndon, Rogers
Keavey, Peter
Luce, Laura
McKay, Brad
Motley, Matt
O'Neil, Murray	(replacement Scotty Gilbert)
Patrick, Micheal (on list in error should be Sherman)
Roberts, Mike
Robinson, Mitch
Rosman, Stewart
Ruscitti, Kevin
Schweiger, James
Suarez, John
Whitt, Mark

Looks like we will NOT meet percentage on original names, so you may want to have the swapping out discussion with Mike Hutchins.

John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, "Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1.")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!

V. frustrating. With delays in Portland and Calgary we won't get signed docs we need today to meet precedent levels for C's. Not sure we can push any harder without pushing them all away.

Not targeting Chris, incidentally.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Polycom, which is expected to price on 1/29/2002.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings 

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the "IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

Right when we start, we will be keeping total var between 15 and 20. It should be mostly gas though because we won't have our power marketers liscense yet.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.  After seeking opinions from various business people, the overwhelming conclusion was to work with the Estate prior to entering business school in the fall.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

Mike

January 24, 2002
Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,
Denver Plachy

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

John/Louise

In checking some of the support areas after you left I discovered that letters for :

- Vuittonet Laura
- Hogan Irena
- Young Rebecca
- Moore Kevin
- Rangel Ina

had been put into the bundle for Wes and Perre ( not sure of spelling ) and they had pulled them as not being part of their group ( they show under the tab - Admins for Houston Commercial )

Collette was concerned that if we send them this will put us over headcount ?

I'll come by first thing tommorrow to follow up.

Robert Ricks is a Lead Forecaster with the National Weather Service in New Orleans.  He is interested in coming in to interview for the position.  He indicated that next Tuesday or Wednesday would be the best dates for him.  He is working midnight to 8am for the remainder of this week.  He can be reached on his cell phone at any time...985-373-0608 or at home...985-875-0015.  His work number is 985-649-0429.

He will be sending me a resume in the next few days.

On other candidates:  Bill Read (MIC- NWS Houston) is considering whether to interview or not.  I will remain in contact with him.
		        Mark Walquist (Forecaster - Wilkens Weather) has declined to interview due to job security issues.
		        John Lewis (Lead Forecaster - NWS Little Rock) has declined to interview due to "happy where I am and no money can change my mind."
		        I am trying to get an update on the status of Steve Lyons, other Weather Channel employees, and Matt Rogers.

Bob and his wife are flying in next Thursday.  Will you look at what you offered him the first time and let me know what you are willing to do for him to move to Houston.  Please reserve a time on Thursday or Friday to meet with him.  We will also need an HR rep for UBS to discuss benefits, etc.

Thanks,
Mike

Just spoke with Colette, she confirmed that the list Lance sent us was in fact inaccurate. In fact we had a target of 74 in the C category (or 70%). As such Colette agreed we were done.

Excellent.

52	Outstanding
42	Declines (Mainly commercial plus Weather)

Deal contingency update:

B List
12 of 12		Target was 80% or 10.

C List

I have meeting with Colette Dow to discuss C list and make sure she is OK with some of the names we have switched out. Presuming she agrees we will be done on this condition.

John,
Are you in charge of sign ups? I know you are for commercial types, and I'm trying to figure out who decides how much I get paid in UBS world.  I have meeting with UBS this afternoon to discuss.  If possible, can you intercede for me and help me get more money (signing bonus and bump in salary, maybe even year contract?)..  Flat bid to current salary is very humbling, especially given market opportunities for my skill set.  

I appreciate everything you've done for this organization and if you are unable to intercede, I'll understand.

Thanks,
Frank

He can leave after six months now and not compete.  He would have 150 K if he signed the 300 doc.  Push him on this.

Fred has decided not to stay long-term. He will consider staying for 6 mo.s but it needs to be a "no brainer" - 250K up front/$250K at the end of the six months. I assume this wont work but let me know.

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=
ve any questions.

Chris

I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
 
I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
 
I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.
 
Does everyone agree?

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

It's my turn, I've asked for nothing 

I need Caroline Abramo 

As well as her bonus we need 

100k and 100k contract. 

A promotion to VP. 

And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp. 

Hunter and I think it is very important.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Karen:

Regarding Mr. Lavorato's I-94, it should remain in his old passport and he
should travel with both passports, until we can file for the change of
status and he obtains a new I-94.  I will be out tomorrow (Wednesday).  If
there are further questions, we can discuss on Thursday.
KInd regards,
Lynn

>From Publishers Weekly
When it was published in the U.K. earlier this year, the latest offering from Scottish writer Smith (Free Love) was made an Orange Prize finalist and shortlisted for the prestigious Booker Prize. Featured are five women whose lives (and a death) overlap at the Global Hotel, a generic establishment in an unnamed city in England. The novel begins with Sara, a chambermaid who plummeted to her death in one of the hotel's dumbwaiters, as her ghost tries to recollect what it was like to be alive....

Hey all - just thought I'd update contact information.  Please let me know if anything needs updating.  Also - missing most people's bdays, spouses/children (for those that these apply to). 

Separately, just a quick update on my search.  While I'm FAR from completing anything (as some of you in the M&A world know better than me), I've recently signed a letter of intent (with a private equity team) to purchase a natural & organic food company in Denver.  Very excited.  Spending full time doing due diligence ... plus since there's always high odds that it will not happen, working on adding new things to the pipeline.  Yell if you have any ideas. 

Talk soon. 

- Andy

Redmond - Approved to go to 175/175 but only after Louise/Lavo speak with him.

Hayden - draft contract at 50/50 as above.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Grigsby would like to make an offer to Bob Badeer.  If you are ok with extending him an offer I think we should offer the same terms as his Portland deal.  Do you remember what we offered?

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

Regarding: energy trading positions 
 
 
I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation with NETCO.  I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk.  In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients.  In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.  I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:
 
?         Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits
?         Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk
?         Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking 
?         Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States
?         Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid
?         Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM
?         Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility
?         Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products
?         Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy
?         Strength in mentoring junior traders
 
Thank you,

It's my turn, I've asked for nothing 

I need Caroline Abramo

As well as her bonus we need

100k and 100k contract.

A promotion to VP.

And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp.

Hunter and I think it is very important.

John,

I am a Kellogg graduate, class of 97.  You spoke with me briefly one day at the MET when I was wearing a Kellogg shirt.  Be careful about that sort of thing in the future.  That is all it took to get me nominated to the speaker planning position.

Anyway, I have agreed to help organize the spring speakers for the Houston chapter of the Kellogg Alums and I am writing to ask if you would be available to make a presentation.  This would likely be a joint session with graduates of some of the other top b-schools. 

We recognize that you would not be able to speak about Enron, but wanted to try and get your views on the markets in general.

Please let me know if you think that this is something you would like to do.  

Thank you,
Michael

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Carolina Group (Loews Corp.), which is expected to price on 1/31/2002.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings 

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the "IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Fred has decided not to stay long-term. He will consider staying for 6 mo.s but it needs to be a "no brainer" - 250K up front/$250K at the end of the six months. I assume this wont work but let me know.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Royal Tenenbaum had three children--all geniuses. And when this absentee father returns one winter, with an unexpected revelation, the Tenenbaums find that genius doesn't help any in reuniting a dysfunctional family. From Wes Anderson, the director of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/761200/ref=mk_del_166895_0/> is the hilarious story of a family of brilliant eccentrics--and how they got that way. Golden Globe
 nominee Gene Hackman stars, along with Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray.

Attached is the 4th floor excel file to be able to assign seats for the estate churn.  The churn date will be Thursday Jan 31.  Fallon's team has asked that the desks be assigned in sequential order.  Can you guys divide the list and get a churn in by noon tomorrow for the guys I sent you earlier?  Please??
They should only be churning phones (turrets don't leave the floor), CPU's, boxes, palms etc.  Key board and mice should remain here.

If there are any additional names that should be added please let me know and add them to the churn.

Please let me know ASAP if there are any problems as these churns affect the churns we're trying to roll behind.  

Thanks!!!
Tammy

I called again today and spoke with Valerie.  She stated that they are currently not expediting passports however she would send in a note requesting that it be sent to you ASAP.  She said that it is currently 20 business days to complete and send.  I did explain that this is urgent for your green card application (remember I also sent a letter with your application).  She said that she could not help.  I asked to speak with a Manager and that is when she sent a message expressing the urgency.

She did confirm that they have your passport information in their office.  I also sent to the necessary materials for them to overnight it back to you.

Sorry John.  If you would like to call them yourself, the number is 819-334-9500.

Subject:	Curves and Correlations

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be "locked in" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

OK so it's really 20 under original plan but because of 8 extra IT folks we are showing just 12 under.

Please find attached the headcount reconciliation you requested.  I have added Su and Shahi to the Fundy's number for tracking purposes.  Given this, I show 12 open positions.  I need to compare my spreadsheets with our database to ensure we have similar info. If I find any discrepancies, I will let you know on Monday.

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Fisher Scientific , which is expected to price on 2/11/2002.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings 

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the "IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

I contacted him and he was interested.  We talked to Dave Ryan about him since they used to work together.  Dave didn't think he would be a very good fit here because Mr. Abrams is basically a radio guy.  Also, his current contract and non-compete restraints may be troublesome.  However, he does have extensive experience and is distinguished in his field.  We were going to keep him in mind but not actively persue him at this time.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.
