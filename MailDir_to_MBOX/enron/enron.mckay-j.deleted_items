We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Jon,

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if these are valid books and ID's.

Firm Trading-Canada (EGSC) [East Region] book
User ID:  ADM55732

Foreign Currency Risk Trading book
User ID:  ADM54746

Thank you,

Karen O'Day

Lucy,

Almost all basis in Canada is quoted in USD, normal convention is to quote the fixed price in CAD.  I will get Ian Cooke to send you the historical basis for AECO (in USD).  If you want a currency curve to work the numbers back into Canadian dollars we can also get you that, but I'm not sure what that would tell you.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Jon

Ian - could you please forward our historical AECO curve to Lucy  - Thanks

Hello again!  Is there anyone up there that can e-mail me historical AECO basis in CAD and USD for the last 5 years?

Many thanks and kind regards,

McMahon in the semi final....beat them 29-16, went to Edmonton for the
final yesterday and killed them 31-16.  Now it's off to Montreal against
Winnipeg.

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

At this week's NGTL TTP meeting, NGTL announced that it was planning to complete a COS study on the Alberta system.  According to NGTL, the purpose of this study is to determine whether their costs are appropriately distributed to their services.  It's likely that this will be setting the groundwork for a new rate application.  This study is currently underway by NGTL.  They will be requesting industry participation at the July 10th TTP meeting.  Discussions between NGTL and industry will occur starting the second half of August and continue until at least early October.

NGTL gave preliminary indications on the areas that will be included in the review.  They include:

	Current receipt and delivery tolls
	Intra-Alberta delivery
	Storage
	Extraction
	Transfers
	Assignments
	Account management

NGTL went down a similar path as part of the initial Products and Pricing Application.  They had initially proposed fees for transfers, assignments, and NITs.  This was strongly opposed by industry at the time and was dropped from the application.  It appears that they are going to try again.  

I will provide each of you with a copy of the hand-out from the meeting.  There is not much more detail than I have outlined here at this point.  These meetings will require a significant time commitment by Enron.  By mid-July, we need to determine (1) what level of involvement we want to have, and (2) if we want to participate, who is the best person to handle the responsibilities.  In the last negotiations, NGTL negotiated almost exclusively with CAPP on the tolling structure.  Other industry members were involved close to the end.  We were very involved on the issues that impacted us, i.e., fees for NIT, etc.  NGTL was heavily criticized about the lack of industry participation in the P&P negotiations.  It appears that they are planning to get more industry involvement this time.

I will set up a meeting later this month to discuss further and to make a decision about our involvement.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Given the experience we had pulling back our West Gate sales this past weekend and the ongoing opportunity for pull back this summer, we should reaquaint ourselves with Enron Canada's Malin deals and shrinkage obligations with the Cochrane extraction plant now owned by Williams.

ECC has longterm Kingsgate sales to ENA of 87,500 mmbtu plus fuel.
Supply is from a producer pool at NIT of 67,500 mmbtu plus fuel  and at ABC of 20,000 mmbtu plus fuel (from Talisman for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel and from Chevron for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel on a NIT for ABC buy/sell).
ECC has a firm longterm commitment to supply the Cochrane plant with 59,000 mcf each day subject to exceptions for force majeure and allowable "Supplier Deficiency Default" days.  ECC is paid $0.005/mcf.  Any shrinkage above this level is interruptible.
In any rolling one-year period ECC is allowed 80 SDD days but has to pay a penalty for deficient volumes.  Penalty scale is as follows:
Days	Deficiency Penalty
0-30	$.0075/mcf
31-40	$.01/mcf
41-50	$.015/mcf
51-60	$.028/mcf
61-70	$.033/mcf
71-80	$.037/mcf
>80	Triggering Event (i.e. allows the contract to be terminated or renegotiated)

As of June1, 2001 there were zero SDD days used up.
Talisman and Chevron have shrinkage arrangement that have to be respected.  Their volumes are ranked first through the ABC meter ahead of ECC's.
 A Force Majeure event with proper notification does not constitute a SDD day.

Implications for Trading

Approximately 9,000 mmbtu can be safely pulled back from Kingsgate without incurring a SDD day.
Approximately 69,000 mmbtu can be pulled back from Kingsgate without pulling back Chevron/Talisman from ABC.
Pulling back Chevron and/or Talisman requires their prior consent and Eric Ledain must first be consulted.
Triggering Event absolutely must not be incurred unless specifically directed by Eric or above.

Stacey/Andrea: It is extremely important that and accurate and up to date SDD count is maintained in our ANG point balance and verified against the monthly statement from the plant that Accounting receives.  Myself, Peggy and Trading should be regularly made aware of what the count is especially at the begining of each month and when we approach a new penalty tier.

Any questions or clarifiacations let me know.

Kevin

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Attached please find the most recent versions of ENA's weekly Management Summary Reports for your review.  These reports will be distributed to each of you on a go-forward basis.  It is important that items on ENA's reports such as Margin, Expenses, Capital Charges and Deals Completed tie-out to our ECC reports as this is what we are evaluated on.  To this end, Grant Patterson has been and will continue to attempt/ensure that the ENA reports are accurate.  If you have questions or concerns regarding the attached reports please see Grant or myself.

By cc to Grant, the margin numbers for the 2nd quarter and, more importantly, YTD, continue to be inaccurately reported.

Regards, Rob

Hi Jon,
 
I just got an answer from the resort......they are  quoting a
rate of 73.00 US per night. That would be your cost  to share
the room and have the same all inclusive  features.
You would pay this amount locally.
 
I am still waiting to hear from the tour company  that I booked the other guys through.  I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks,
Debby

Please review the attached fx memo I have prepared.  Can every body meet Monday June 25th at 2:00 pm to go over it?

 This is the memo that we are going to give to the doorstep auditors and it will also provide me guidance as to the way to proceed in solving our fx issues.

Hi Jon,

Enron currently markets about 4.5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day.
I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12bcf a day that the NIT number can  easily be double this. It doesn't appear that Enron markets 50% of Alberta's gas each day...yet.  

I hope this answers your question, let me know if you need anything else.

Ian

We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in Toronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in Alberta. 
1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
2.  Can we publically make this representation?  

Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your analysts puts together for the morning meeting? 

Many thanks
Kate

Apparently, the London office was able to justify multiple functional currencies for a single legal entity.  Beth Apollo felt that we could make a strong case to have separate accounting entities for power and gas, each with their own functional currencies.  Please read through the attached documents and I will set up a meeting to discuss this further next week.  We can get Shelly Stubbs or Beth Apollo involved as well if needed.
Thanks
Peggy

Peggy,

Apologies for not getting back to you sooner.  I had to track down a FASB book as all of my electronic notes are in the great Enron IT black hole!

There are several passages in FASB 52 which justify multi functional currencies for a single legal entity.  I have quoted a few excerpts for you below.  The AA person in London who "signed off" on this for us was Sarah Williams, but I have been told she is no longer with AA.  However, there are several references to companies that do the same thing and arguments for the same on AA's Research Manager web site.  I have copied some text from AA in the attached word document.

I don't think you will have any problems, but if you do and I can help, let me know.

Regards,
Shelly

FASB 52

Paragraph 5:  The assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity.  An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates...

Para 7:  An entity might have more than one distinct and separable operation, such as a division or branch, in which case each operation may be considered a separate entity.  If those operations are conducted in different economic environments, they might have different functional currencies.

39:  An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates...

43:  In some instances, a foreign entity might have more than one distinct and separable operation.  (furthers with an example).  ..each operation may be considered to be an entity as that term is used in this statement; and, based on the facts and circumstances, each operation might have a different functional currency.

Here is the agenda for today's TCPL Tolls Task Force meeting in Quebec City=
.  Let me know if there is anything you think is significant. My feeling is=
 the Fuel Incentive proposal will be looked at with a great deal of skeptic=
ism by the shipper community.   I intend to follow the Business Process sub=
-committee that started meeting this month but I have not been able to atte=
nd any meetings yet.

The next TTF  meeting is in Calgary during Stampede week.  I will be out of=
 town at that time and suggest Fino cover it.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I assumed that all was well. Beth said you had a blister. I told her  to tell
you how to treat it hoepfully she passed that on to you. At week 8, if you
would be will to consider it, That would be a good week for a 5k race. Just a
test race. Give me a call some evening if you have any questions. Saturday
evening works best for me. My wife works at a radio station from 5-12 on
Saturday evenings.

Our Lotus Notes based exception time system is not working due to some Outlook migration issues.   Human Resources, IT Calgary and IT in Houston are working to resolve the problems as quickly as possible.

Until the system is reprogrammed, please seek exception time approval from your supervisor and record your time manually.   An update will be sent when the system is functioning properly and is ready to use.

Thank you for your patience.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Jon,
I guess it isn't critical that we see whether the  trades are a buy or a sell.  The reason that I had requested this was to  ensure that I has both sides of the trade but in your case you may be long or  short depending on the circumstance.  Therefore, if you could just include  the Enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by  Enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts.  I understand your  concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if  there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie  chart. 
Unfortunately, I am not in the office on Monday or Tuesday  so will not be able to reach you.  If you have any further concerns please  call me on Wednesday to discuss.

Inglis: Mayor acted alone in Satan ban
By ALEX LEARY, Times Staff Writer
? St. Petersburg Times, published January 29, 2002


   INGLIS -- Polly Bowser, a 36-year-old waitress and mother of three, said she has felt like a pariah ever since she took exception to Mayor Carolyn Risher's proclamation banning Satan from town.   INGLIS -- Polly Bowser, a 36-year-old waitress and mother of three, said she has felt like a pariah ever since she took exception to Mayor Carolyn Risher's proclamation banning Satan from town.

   Over the past two months, the women have traded arguments in newspapers and on radio and television, with Bowser saying the declaration was a violation of the separation of church and state and Risher defending her right of expression, even if that means invoking the name of Jesus Christ.

   On Monday, the debate went to the Town Commission, which swiftly declared the proclamation the work of an individual, not a town official, because it was never authorized, despite being on town stationery.

   That appears to be enough to inoculate the town against a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which took interest in the issue on Bowser's behalf.

   "This takes care of it nicely," said Gary Edinger, an attorney with the ACLU chapter in Gainesville.

   But it was clear few townspeople disagree with Risher, who is 61 and a lifelong resident of the Levy County community 90 miles north of St. Petersburg.

   Nearly 100 supporters packed Town Hall -- those without seats sat on stacks of 2 by 4s -- to decry what they view as discrimination against Christians.

   "The ACLU makes me sick," Glenda Townsend, a 50-year-old retiree, shouted into a microphone. "Evil will abound when good men do nothing. It's time to stand up, America."

   As if on cue, the audience rose from the metal folding chairs. Some shouted "Amen." Others simply shouted. Later the group joined hands to sing God Bless America.

   Town Commission member Floyd Craig said he would challenge Risher next year. "We're getting a lot of media attention lately, and it's made the town the dang laughingstock of the country."

   This story began, appropriately, on Halloween. The mayor attended a cookout at Yankeetown Church of God and was inspired by Pastor Richard Moore, who called for a 40-day fast in the name of Jesus. When she returned home that night she felt a bolt of inspiration and, sitting at the kitchen table, began to write furiously.

   "Be it known from this day forward that Satan, ruler of darkness, giver of evil, destroyer of what is good and just, is not now, nor ever again will be, a part of this town of Inglis. Satan is hereby declared powerless, no longer ruling over, nor influencing, our citizens."

   She made five copies. One was placed on her office wall, near a painting of the Last Supper and heart-shaped pictures of Elvis, who filmed Follow That Dream here in early 1960s.

   The remaining scrolls were stuffed into hollowed-out posts placed at the four entrances to the town. The posts, painted with the words "Repent," "Request" and "Resist," were sealed and capped.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd
Thu	11/22	65 Bcfd
Fri	11/23	65 Bcfd
Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd
Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,

Hello Jay,

I was wondering if you could tell me if there is a specific time each day
that the datafile that we access is taken offline.  We had a little glitch
last Friday when we tried to do our "end-of-day" poll at 5:00 and couldn't
access the file.  We were able to get a copy of the file from Enron locally
in Calgary and it solved our problem.  Alternatively, however, we would like
to adapt the code so it doesn't try to poll late in the day (if the file
won't be available late in the day).  Could you tell me if there are
specific times when the file won't be available each day?

Thanks Jay.  Otherwise, the feed is working really well.  We've hammered out
most of the implemenation bugs and it seems to be pretty smooth now.

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Peter:

Attached you will find a sample of what ENA submits to Inside FERC.  As you can see, it is a download from EOL and does not include counterparty names.

I trust this is of some help to you in your current situation.

We intend to start officializing a gas book for our Enron Direct business starting July 3rd.  From this officialized book credit, VAR, cashflows and positions can be pulled.  It will be a relatively flat book because every deal with a 3rd party has been backed with our trading desk.  The name of the book in FT-CAND-DIRECT.  There will be a consolidated price and basis book and an index book.  The portfolio code is 6*.  The currrent MTM of the portfolio is approx $1M USD and is comprised of about 10 different counterparties.  The positions and VAR should be reported under McKay.

Kathy

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Hi Chris.  We are developing a new report that will run within the EOL Reports application.  You will be able to run it and then save it to an XML format that can then be mailed to NGX.  We'll be able to get this out for Monday morning.

Peter,

We need to provide wording to the auditors regarding the following:
1.	Notification wrt "Trades in Error" - Article 6.2
2.	Alternate data delivery procedures.

We have agreed to notify NGX verbally of any "Trades in Error" in a timely fashion.  Upon notification we would defer to Article 6.2 of the Alberta Price Index Methodology document.  NGX would take care of notifying industry participants and removing the trade from the indices.

With respect to alternate data delivery, we have agreed to provide the data electronically at least hourly.  The data will be provided to NGX in the XML format outlined in the interface document.

Would you please write up a couple paragraphs that outline our obligations.  If you have any questions please contact Mckay or myself.  TKS.

Lambie

This is what I know so far... the South Wapiti inlet header blew up.  The inspection team is going out today to survey the damage.  From speaking to Ron Johnson (operator @ S Wapiti), he feels the damage is significant thus many parts and valves will have to be changed out.  Depending on crews and availability of parts, the plant will be 0 (zero) for at least 2 days if not until mid next week.  South Wapiti produces approximately 80% of Iroquois Creek meter thus 200,000 GJ will be off until the plant is back up.

I will keep you informed on any new information.

Subject:	Line Rupture at South Wapiti

There has been a line rupture at the South Wapiti plant which has resulted
in about 200 mmcf off the NOVA system.  Des doesn't have any details as yet
other than we will likely lose about 5000 gj of production today.  Her info
so far says that no one was hurt but the fire trucks are there.  We'll keep
you posted.

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd 
Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd 
Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd 
Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd 
Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow, 
The Weather Team

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

TCPL has replied to the NEB they and the signatories wish to proceed with their application unamended.  Now for the board to establish a process.  The earliest this could be in place would be August 1 but realistically it could be much later than that.

The NEB has advised that because of the substantial opposition to the Settlement, it can not treat it as a "Negotiated Settlement".  This means the board will not be obligated to approve or deny the application as a whole and could cherry pick what components get approved.  The board has asked TCPL to confirm whether to they wish to proceed with the application or file something new before the board establishes a process to consider the tolls.  Interesting to see if any of the signatories walk away from the deal in light of this.

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of "force majeure" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

An event of Force Majeure occurred on Northern Border (NBPL) on July 13 at =
Station 8 resulting in curtailment of deliveries through Ventura from July1=
3-18.  As a result, ENA was not able to take full delivery of firm volumes =
from EC at the Monchy upstream interconnect.

EC and ENA hold divergent views on how to implement the curtailment.  We ne=
ed to reach a common understanding.

The view of EC is that a force majeure event, as defined by Article 5 of ou=
r master agreement with ENA (see Attachment) or superceded by amendments co=
ntained in individual confirmation letters, implies that all firm transacti=
ons must be curtailed "by the same percentage that the applicable transport=
er interrupts or curtails firm delivery service..." (language in parenthese=
s was directly lifted from a Monchy confirmation letter dated November 1, 1=
997 signed by Julie Gomez). =20

The view of ENA, as articulated by Martin and Lisa, is that Northern Border=
 sends scheduled volumes back to Unify via EDI with a service agreeement pa=
thed to a firm supply deal.  The pipeline scheduled volume for the path dri=
ves how much each individual  deal is curtailed  even if some supply deals =
are cut by a different percentage than others. My apologies if I have not e=
xpressed this properly.

In other words, we agree on the magnitude of the curtailment but not how to=
 allocate cuts to individual deals.

Because we have desk to desk deals (since earlier this year), ENA and EC mu=
st agree on scheduled volumes.  In the past our deals were Physical Forward=
 and if our volumes did not agree it was not discovered until invoicing, at=
 which time the accountants would duke it out.  Now, Logistics quite proper=
ly has to deal with it within the month.  This has implications at all poin=
ts where ENA transacts with EC such as Kingsgate, Empress, Eastern Canada.

EC  has reluctantly agreed to accept ENA's non-proportional scheduled volum=
es for this event so that the schedulers can move on but I would appreciate=
 a policy resolution to this issue prior to the next downstream curtailment=
.

Attachment

Legal Opinion dated July 20, 2001

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of "force majeure" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

The NEB has advised that because of the substantial opposition to the Settlement, it can not treat it as a "Negotiated Settlement".  This means the board will not be obligated to approve or deny the application as a whole and could cherry pick what components get approved.  The board has asked TCPL to confirm whether to they wish to proceed with the application or file something new before the board establishes a process to consider the tolls.  Interesting to see if any of the signatories walk away from the deal in light of this.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack is raising great concerns worldwide.  Many facilities in the United States and around the world have received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, in fact, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees worldwide with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

-- It is marked with the word "Anthrax."
-- It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
-- It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
-- Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
-- Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
-- Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
-- Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
-- Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".
-- Has a strange odor or stain.
-- Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
-- Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
-- Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
-- If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
-- Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
-- Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call the local police authorities.
-- List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
-- Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
-- Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call the local police authorities. 
-- Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
-- Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
-- If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

TCPL filed an application with the NEB yesterday seeking an increase in rate of return.  They are asking for a new methodology called "After-Tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital" which would be 7.5%.  Using the existing methodology this would translate to a return of 12.52% on 40% deemed equity in the capital structure (equity thickness).  This would equate to a return of 16.69% if the equity thickness was 30%.  Currently TCPL has a regulated return of 9.61% and 30%.

If TCPL gets what they are seeking it would result in an annualized Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.25 (Chippawa $1.261).   The invoiced toll would be higher to recover the difference from the interim toll, currently set at $1.132.

I have a copy of the three binder application if anyone wants to see it.

Kevin

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

I need to refresh this quote:
John, this time, can I just have the Sumas piece instead of the all in price?
Volumes are on the attachment.

John: Sumas Offer please.  Dec-Mar02 and then May02-Nov02.
Dutch: Nymex piece.




I attached the numbers this time.  Again, I'm  looking for your offer for a fixed price, Northwest Pipeline sumas index swap   
 
Thanks

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Ian, 
I have not been able to get ahold of Jon McKay and have heard through the grapevine that he has gone to Houston with Enron.  Therefore, I am contacting you to try to get some information necessary for the assembly of the month end pie chart.  I am wondering if Jonathan has designated responsibility for getting the information to us on the last business day of every month.  Also, I would like to get the July near month information to do a test run.  If possible please forward me this information or let me know who to contact to get the necessary information.
Thanks,

Good Morning,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $99 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, however, all parking changes must be made via e-mail, no later than 1/18/01. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.

Spoke to Dan at NGX today.  He said the external interface document looked fine and he had no questions or concerns.  He had no idea what you might be waiting for turn around on.  Feel free to give him a call if you need anything further.  

If there is anything else I can do to help speed things along just let me know.
Lambie

We are having some trouble getting NGX to return our phone calls regarding some technical documents we sent over there. Could you call them and let them know we need a turn around asap to make our deadline.

thanks,
Andy

Dear Friend,

In the days and weeks that have passed since 11 September, we have heard from AIMR members and CFA candidates around the world. They have expressed shock. They have expressed anger. And they have expressed sadness for those who died, at least 56 of whom were fellow AIMR members and CFA candidates.

Above all else, however, the members and candidates with whom we have spoken have expressed an eagerness to become active participants in the world?s recovery from these tragic events. In response to their desires, and in honor of the many thousands of people who died or who were permanently injured in the attacks, the AIMR Board of Governors has established:

The AIMR 11 September Memorial Scholarship Fund (to contribute online go to http://www.aimr.org/featuring/research/11septscholarship/index.html).

The fund will provide scholarships to those victimized by the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001--casualties and their spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. Scholarship recipients will have stated a desire to pursue an undergraduate degree in finance, economics, or a related field.

A distinguishing feature of this fund is that scholarship recipients will come from nations all over the world.

While terrorists attacked humanity on 11 September, their choice of the World Trade Center was not coincidental. It was a clear attempt to undermine free and open capital markets everywhere in the world. This scholarship fund is therefore intended not only to benefit the casualties and their surviving loved ones, but ultimately the global investment community itself by encouraging a new generation of bright minds to explore the opportunities available in the fields of finance and economics.

AIMR has established the fund with an initial grant of US$1,000,000 of its own. We will rely on members, CFA candidates, and others from the global investment community to provide additional contributions. The scholarship program will be managed through the Research Foundation of AIMR, a 501(c) 3 charitable organization under U.S. tax law.

Certainly there is no shortage of charitable causes related to the 11 September attacks to which you can contribute.  As you consider whether to make a contribution to the AIMR Memorial Scholarship Fund, you should know that one hundred percent of collected funds will be re-distributed to scholarship recipients. In other words, AIMR will not use any of the contributions to offset the administration of the fund.

You will be receiving this same solicitation by mail in the next week or two. You also can make a contribution via the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/featuring/research/11septscholarship/index.html. For tax advantages, some may prefer to contribute securities rather than cash.  Whatever way you choose to give, your contribution is likely to be tax deductible.*

Day by day, the world and the investment community are recovering from the events of 11 September and getting on with our lives. We believe the best way AIMR and the Research Foundation can honor the victims of the attacks is through a collective act of kindness such as what has been described above. We hope you or your firm will join AIMR in making a generous contribution to the AIMR 11 September Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Sincerely,

Philippe A. Sarasin, CFA
AIMR Chair

Thomas A. Bowman, CFA
AIMR President & CEO

Fred H. Speece, Jr., CFA
Chair of the Research Foundation

P.S. If you choose to make a contribution by check, please make it payable to the AIMR 11 September Memorial Scholarship Fund. If you wish to make a contribution by phone, please call 1-800-247-8132 or 434-951-5499.


*Consult your tax advisor to verify that your contribution to the Research Foundation is indeed tax deductible.

Gerry, here is the rider we discussed.  The force majeure language goes with the delivery point, so will be inserted in all confirms using that DP.  Let me know if you or your customers have any comments.

Hi Jon,

Thinking of you and thought I'd try out your new e-mail address.  Hope you are having a good day.It snowed again last night, but is suppose to warm up a bit today. Dad got home late last night from Vancouver.  He said it was very nice there.

I forgot to tell you and Beth last time we talked that the pointsettia you gave Dad when he was in hospital at Christmas is still doing well,  The other ones I had are long gone.  Just thought you should know that it probably pays to spend the buck on them as it must mean they are better cared for during growth.  Also, did you ever call Grandpa and what did he have to say?  I talked to him briefly last night but didn't want to ask if you had talked to him in case you hadn't.  He asked about you though and was of course pleased to hear you were working.  He has a very sore throat so I didn't talk very long.

Okay I don't want to take up too much of your time.  Love you.

Mum

HI Jon,

The IT guys do not know when we can begin scraping Tetco and Algonquin/Mar data today, but the moment it comes out I'll get the map down to you.  I don't quite understand the problem, but when we switched to a new server we lost some access rights that we originally had to dukes website.

I'll keep you updated.

HI Guys, 
Thanks for the Data files you sent, if I have any other questions, I will contact you guys today sometime this afternoon. 
Jonathan, Graham and myself were talking to NGX and they said that they almost always have contracts that have "Firm Performance Obligations" and that are non-interruptible.  Is that the same for Enron as well?  And I just wanted to confirm that I will be receiving the policies and procedures for how trades-in-error and breakdowns in communication are dealt with, sometime this afternoon.
Thankyou,

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

No.  If they declare FM against us, the operative wording in the agreement =
is "to the extent that they are affected by such event".  In other words, t=
hey can only cut a deal to the extent the force majeure prevents them from =
performing.

Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipel=

Subject:=09ENA-ECC Force Majeure

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of "force majeure" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

Chris,
I was speaking with Gerry Hrap and he said that they will require the number by tomorrow morning at the latest for negotiations with Calpine (per discussion with yourself, John McKay, and Scott Neil).
Sorry for the rush,

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Hi Jon,
 
Sorry to take so long getting back to you. I have  asked the tour company what the cost would be to have you in the
room with the others, plus I have emailed the hotel  to see
what they would charge if you just paid it  locally.
 
So, far I have heard from neither. The tour company  did
say it could take a few days to find out whether or  not they could do it.
Because the most likely way for you to get there  will be
with American Airlines, I checked with their tour  desk and
they did offer the same hotel but didnt have any  space left.
All I can tell you at this point is that your  airfare with American Airlines will be around 700.00 US. In  the
meantime, you might try calling a travel agency  down there
to see what the best rate is they can find on a  flight for you
from Feb 15 - 19. They might have differnet fares  that arent
available from here.
I will keep you posted on the hotel.
ps...which one of the guys do you know  
Talk to you soon,
Debby

The issue isn't can we.  It's how much extra work would be involved in doing this.  Also, if you had a financial hedge between gas and power with different functional currencies, our overall P&L could be significantly impacted by this. 

I talked this over with the internal audit people when they were up here.  They agreed this could be significantly extra work with the integration of our operations.

Apparently, the London office was able to justify multiple functional currencies for a single legal entity.  Beth Apollo felt that we could make a strong case to have separate accounting entities for power and gas, each with their own functional currencies.  Please read through the attached documents and I will set up a meeting to discuss this further next week.  We can get Shelly Stubbs or Beth Apollo involved as well if needed.
Thanks

Peggy,

Apologies for not getting back to you sooner.  I had to track down a FASB book as all of my electronic notes are in the great Enron IT black hole!

There are several passages in FASB 52 which justify multi functional currencies for a single legal entity.  I have quoted a few excerpts for you below.  The AA person in London who "signed off" on this for us was Sarah Williams, but I have been told she is no longer with AA.  However, there are several references to companies that do the same thing and arguments for the same on AA's Research Manager web site.  I have copied some text from AA in the attached word document.

I don't think you will have any problems, but if you do and I can help, let me know.

Regards,
Shelly

FASB 52

Paragraph 5:  The assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity.  An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates...

Para 7:  An entity might have more than one distinct and separable operation, such as a division or branch, in which case each operation may be considered a separate entity.  If those operations are conducted in different economic environments, they might have different functional currencies.

39:  An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates...

43:  In some instances, a foreign entity might have more than one distinct and separable operation.  (furthers with an example).  ..each operation may be considered to be an entity as that term is used in this statement; and, based on the facts and circumstances, each operation might have a different functional currency.

Hi Chris,  

Tonight we are rolling out a new report.  Currently, only you and Jon have access to it.  You'll select it off the main reports menu.  It will say "NGX Download report".  When you launch it, it will show the data on screen like all other reports.  There is a button at the bottom that says "Export".  Clicking it will give you several selections.  Choose the one that says "Save to NGX XML".  You can then save it as a file which can be mailed to NGX.  

Let me know if there is anyone else who needs access.

Thanks!
 -jay

Hi Jon,

I spoke with Russel and this is what he said:

-Enron Canada Corp. will be posting the letter of credit
-the cost will be 75-100bp's per amount of LC ie.  $1,000,000 =$7,500-$1,000
-the cost will be associated with the particular business group-most likely Enron Canada
-NGX will provide updates and so will Russel regarding the $30 MM credit
-We will have to be actively requesting our position
-Russel said he will be able to run real time data in a crunch situation but typically we can expect a one day lag

Russel also mentioned that he is going to contact NGX's credit group so they can attempt tp mimic NGX's format the best that they can.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Ian

Subject:	Gas Merchantability Reminder

December 19, 2001

Notice to: All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, 
Interconnecting Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental 
Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) System

 Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder

Transco has been receiving gas with a slightly higher heating 
content (btu/cf) in its mainline over the past week and feels 
this is the result of processing plants scaling back their 
operations due to poor economics. Transco reminds Producers and 
Shippers on its system to ensure that processing arrangements 
are in place and that the gas received by Transco meets its 
merchantability requirements. 

These gas merchantability specifications are outlined in 
Transco's gas merchantability notice, most recently re-posted 
July 27, 2001. 

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact 
the following at Transco: Ron Doyle, 713-215-2921 or Terry 
Fitch, 713-215- 3361.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Hi Jon,

I have a username and password for Dan to use.  I just left him a message to call me to get them.  Additionally, I'll verify that he's comfortable with the specs when he calls.

Jay,

Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.

Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.


Regards,

Jon

Andy,

We pulled the log ... found the guy ... and told him to knock it off.

Susan

As per our phone conversation, I am dropping you a note to explain why there was a decrease in the sales volumes for Canada
from the first to second quarter 2001.

There are two reasons for the decline in sales volumes:

	1.  Last year EOL offered a fixed rate product that produced minimal margins but a large volume of transactions.
	     It was decided that this product would not be offered in the year of 2001, but because there were winter deals
	     that continued through to March 2001, we did not see a decline in volumes until April 2001.

           2.   Enron Canada was involved in ligitation with NGX, with respect to their publication of the Aeco index.  ECC did
	     not have any confidence in the index because the EOL deals were not included in determining the Aeco monthly index
	     and we felt the index could easily be manipulated.  As a result, ECC was hesistant to enter into Aeco Monthly index 
                 deals with counterparties thus reducing our volume of sales.

I hope this helps!

Cheryl

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

Subject:	FW: DYN($42/sh)/ENE($7/sh) Merger At Risk. - Simmons and Company latest thoughts

got this from a friend at dynegy.  written by someone at Simmons & Co., Inc.

                                         To:     Sales Trading

                    AM                   Subject:     DYN($42/sh)/ENE
($7/sh) Merger At
                                          Risk.




SUMMARY:  We are reducing our estimated probability that the DYN/ENE merger
is completed to less than 50%/50% based on our belief that ENE's existing
wholesale and retail businesses are having a difficult time maintaining
their volumes and margins.  We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter
party confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we
believe counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the
information included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the
stock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with
competing traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter
parties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more
negative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving
since the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting
improment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity
position seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent
capital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume
and margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K
disclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed
to provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone
of the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading
activities with ENE.

OPINION ON THE STOCKS:
   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply
   not worth the downside risk.
   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns
   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated
   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we
   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,
   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If
   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that
   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would
   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away
   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the
   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to
   terminate the transaction through material adverse change
   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe
   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are
   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still
   has $5/sh to $7/sh of "deal" premium factored into the current stock
   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN
   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE
   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with
   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).

COUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction
volume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If
you are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term
transaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other
suppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the
account receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why
would you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the
ultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe
that ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases
and/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.
However, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.

EPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):
   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90
   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from
   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In
   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be
   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's
   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in
   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Jon,
As discussed, here is a reminder of the agreement we reached prior to my move back to Calgary. Rob Milnthorp offered me $10,000 as a moving compensation. I would appreciate if you could get in touch with the HR department to make the steps necessary for that amount to be processed. 

Again, thank you for your help and support.

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

Jon, 
I am wondering if you can have someone at your office send over the information for July near month so that we can complete a test run before we go live with the pie chart in August.  This will also allow us to see what kind of percentages to expect, the kind of information we will get, etc.  This will allow us to troubleshoot the process as well. If this is a problem please let me know at the number listed below.  
Also, within the next week or so I will let you know who to forward the information to on a monthly basis beginning on the last business day of July.

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="" BridgeEntityName="EOLBridge" Message="Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status="F" BridgeDate="20011025170945CDT"}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Hi Dawn,

Just to keep you posted, I think that you can expect a call from Claudette DeBruijn at the U of A Co-op office in the near future.  It seems that she has some delusions of grandeur about "her" Co-op program.  She is quite bothered by my descision to drop out, because it "hurts the program" - I'm not sure how since it makes one student and one company happy.  I will be done school in April, and she has very little power to stop that, but she does seem to want to rant and rave about it for a while.  She may also want to speak with Jon and Chris since they spoke with her minions when they were here.

Jason

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Mark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index.  Inside F.E.R.C. is now requiring that, in addition to pure trading data, we must also provide counterparty identification.  On the basis that we cannot provide that counterparty identification, both due to contractual obligations and business policies/practices, our information was excluded from the Sumas Index for the last index period.  I know, for example, in negotiating the settlement with NGX, that the provision of counterparty identification was a matter of very serious concern, particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL.

However, I am advised by Jon McKay that, notwithstanding these apparent contractual restrictions and business policies/practices, Houston provides counterparty identifications to Inside F.E.R.C.

The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications, our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index, which is particularly problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point.  On the other hand, if we do provide counterparty identification, we run the risk of breaching confidentiality obligations, business policies/practices and upsetting our trading counterparties.

I guess we have two alternatives, one is to continue to not disclose counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F.E.R.C. will change its view on this (although, as I mentioned, their position is that Houston provides them with that information), or provide counterparty identifications at the risk of getting offside our counterparties.

My preference would be to do the former, but I think this is a matter you may want to review with Lavo and let me know how Houston intends to proceed.

Regards,
Peter

If you have not yet had the opportunity to enroll for the 2002 CFA exam, AIMR is pleased to announce that you now can do so electronically through the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/cfaprogram/index.html.

The next enrollment deadline is 3 December 2001 and, as a reminder, this year AIMR must RECEIVE your enrollment form and payment by the deadline date.

Many CFA candidates have inquired about the status of the New York Society, which had its office in the World Trade Center. We are happy to report that all NYSSA staff escaped safely on 11 September, that the organization is relocating to midtown Manhattan, and that is up and running with a full slate of educational programs. Visit http://www.nyssa.org for information about NYSSA's Fall and Spring continuing education and CFA review courses, and seminars.
