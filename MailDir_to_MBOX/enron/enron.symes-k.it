I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume 
reports. He doesn't actually have access to ICE data right now, but has 
requested it from staff at the exchange. He's not sure of the exact day he 
might begin receiving this report, but told me it would be sometime next 
week. I'll let you know when I find out. 

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or 
would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our 
volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,
Kate

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Hi guys.  I just talked to Willie in Houston and thought I'd pass along what 
he told me.

He said that the Index prices are going to be automated probably by the end 
of this week (that means no more manual entry).

If we have problems with the numbers in EnPower, contact Willie Harrell at 
6-853-9226
If we have problems with the numbers in Unify,  contact  Kelly Lombardi at 
6-345-8491

They are also training a girl named Jenny (? last name). 

Thanks for all your help last week, Kate.

The prices to 'calc' are based on those dates   'current-date' vs

Hi Kate,

I spoke to Will Smith, and he told me that the best way to approach testing 
these reports, is to compare the old version of the report with the new 
version of the report using the prod database.   Please ensure that the data 
is the same, such as seeing that  the two versions list the same deals, and 
show the same volumes.  However, please keep in mind that  you may see extra 
columns in the stage version because of the  new fields we implemented:  
External Exchange ID  and External Exchange Code.  

You already have the icon for Enpower prod, (what you normally use)  but in 
order to test the stage version of the report against the prod database, you 
need to create a shortcut. Below are the directions on how to create a 
shortcut:

C:\\Enpower\Stage\AggSchVol   your_id   your_password   pwrprodn_ded

1.  Replace AggSchVol with the name of the application that you are testing.  
(Below is a list of all the reports that need to be tested)
2.  Replace your_id and your_password with your own username and password on 
the above line.
3.  Copy that above line (with CTRL-C, but don't paste it anywhere yet).
4.  Minimize all windows until you have your desktop.
5.  Right click on desktop and select New and then Shortcut from the menu.
6.  Paste line on Command line.
7.  Click Next.
8.  Click Finish.
9.  You should now have an AggSchVol.exe (or other application) icon from 
which you can get into that application.


Once again, here is a list of the reports that need to be tested:

AggSchVol    
ConCount    
CPConfirm    
CPTerm    
Credit     
Emissions    
EOL Report (4 tabs within this one) 
FollowUp    
HighPriceDeals 


As always, please call me or Laura Aldis (713-345-4410) if you have any 
questions or comments.  (Laura Aldis is our other Enpower QA tester).

Thanks so much for helping  us test these applications.

Nadine

Kroum,

Users are having difficulty deleting term strips in Deal Entry due to the 
existence of deal_strip_setlmt_ext records.  Is Deal Entry supposed to delete 
these records explicitly or are we supposed to have a trigger in place to 
handle this?

Thanks,

Enron requires that we purchase all of our equipment through a central 
purchasing process.  The reasons for doing this are two fold.  

1) Enron supports only certain technologies.  It is important to standardize 
the technology sitting on each person's desktop to ensure it works with other 
technology already on your desk and that the IT staff knows how to support 
the use of this technology.

2) Enron has cut deals with suppliers that give us good prices.  In the past, 
the Portland office has not strictly adhered to this policy.  We had good 
business reasons for not complying--we could buy the same equipment at the 
same price a lot faster if we just bought it ourselves locally.

Here's the problem.  People have not always bought the "same" equipment.  For 
example, people have recently purchased flat screen monitors that are 
different than the Compaq flat screens that most of us use.  This requires 
our technology group to understand how the different screens work, whether 
they need different drivers installed on your hard drive, and what to do with 
them if they break.  There are numerous other examples.  In aggregate, this 
practice has put additional strains on our already constrained technology 
support staff and will cause us problems in the future if any of the 
non-standard equipment breaks and can't be fixed or replaced in a hurry.

Accordingly, Dave Steiner and I would appreciate it if you would do the 
following when purchasing technology.
All pending and future purchasing requests should now go through the local IT 
Department.  
Please send an email to the "IT Portland" email account when you have an IT 
related need such as a Palm Pilot, LCD screen, special software, etc.  
The local IT team will then assure compliance and availability of the 
requested item(s) and get back to you with cost, ETA, and any other relevant 
information.
If the centralized Houston purchasing process is too slow to meet our 
business need, IT Portland will investigate buying the exact same product 
locally.
 
Again, our goal is to streamline the process while conforming to corporate 
standards.  This will also assure that the items acquired will work with 
existing infrastructure and be easily supported by our IT team.  The team has 
assured me they will be prompt in responding to your requests.  If you have 
any questions, please contact Dave Steiner or me.  Your adherence to this 
process is appreciated.

Subject: West new futures deals

Jeremy:

Thanks for your help yesterday as we finally got the three new futures deals 
calc-ed.  However, we had a problem with the Mid Price that TAGG system 
pulled for evaluation of these deals.  

Specifically, from the Fowards Detail Report for post id 1035917, we found 
that TAGG was using $3.75 as Mid Price for these three new deals (#QQ0362.0, 
#QQ3837.0, #QQ7050.0).  However, the curve prices for mid-columbia as of 
yesterday (2/8) for these three deals should be $290, $280, and $330, 
repectively.  

So, 
1. We are wondering where the $3.75 came from?
2. Would you please let us know the "Org. Region" and "Commodity Code" that 
TAGG is using for these three new deals?  I need to communicate these codes 
to Enpower Support so they can translate these codes to what they should be 
in Enpower in order for Enpower to recognize these deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

         Diana,

         Can you point out a deal number of which we are talking about and 
you have a problem with.
         (maybe between EAST and WEST).

         In general desk-to desk deals don't get scheduled which means there 
won't be any
         schedule changes. 

          Thanks,
          Kroum

    Hi Diana & Kate,


    You are not wasting our time, you make our time valuable. You should be 
able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,
    if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes 
insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which
    Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things 
like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.

   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) 
data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with
   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule 
data should be very much the same with all the changes
   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and 
liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and
   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain 
data from 3/22/2001 to 4/5/2001, and the liquidation
   the same data from 4/2/1996. 

   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule 
between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule
   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk. I hided the check box to avoid 
confusions. The option Show Desk is very simple, changes the format
   of the header for Region, nothing else.

Kroum,

I was running the new version of the Obligation Report.  I was not included 
in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still 
not doing what the "fix" was initiated for.  Originally, my discussions with 
Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any 
changes made in Deal Scheduling and  2.  All Desk to Desk deals.  Number 
(2),   I believe was the difficult one.  When selecting the option on "Show 
Deals"  in order to capture schedule changes you must select "Liquidate".  
This does work, but it does not give you the option to select "Show Desk to 
Desk", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.  Please 
contact me for further discussion.  I apologize for not participating and 
wasting your time.  

Sincerely,

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Thanks,

I've tested the "schedule" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!

     Every program has two parts - Windows executable which we write in Delphi
    and database in Oracle. We need to run the stage version of the program
    against production data (database). The stage version of the program in 
TestN
    and TestP is the same, the database (the data) is different.

     I think I will give you a call.

    Cara,

   Thanks a lot for the detail error report.
   Actually to me is enough to see the selection screen and the numbers of 
the deals
   which are missing or are extra on the report.


   1) I can see that you are running the older version of the report, because 
there is selection
for Approval on the screen. Probably is our mistake. The shortcut does not 
update the new
version. You need to run the STAGE Enpower launchpad with all the buttons at 
first which
will copy the new version of Forward Obligation from the server to your local 
computer
at first and then to run the shortcut.

  2) I run the newer version here, I can see the parts of the deals 503112 
and 503107
which you have highlited and the region totals were zero's. You can verify it.


 3) We just released a new version to stage, which should have the same 
reasults, but we
did some optimizations, we intend to reduce the speed soon.
The version number is 3.0.0.36, you can see it when you run the report or 
click Help-About.
Until you don't see that number there is no use to continue testing, on any 
problem
call David Poston


    Thanks,
    Kroum

Good Morning,

I ran the new report against production, using the shortcut provided for me. 
My results are innacurate because some transmission deals are not showing. 
The strange thing is that there is no real pattern as to why some 
transmission deals show and some don't.

I compared the forward ob to scheduling.   You might want to do that 
comparison for yourself there.  Also, checking the Real-Time position manager 
as well will help.

Please see this power point document.

Kate, I ran the report with the exact same options and it came right up.  Try

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.


     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

     Thanks,
     Kroum

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thanks,

Hi Kate,

Your request is complete, effective upon refresh of the EnPower System, or 
3/17/01.

Let us know if Paul needs access to any other desks.

Best Rgds.

Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would 
be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will 
potentially do deals with all of the traders -

Long Term Southwest
Long Term Northwest
Long Term California
Long Term West Management

Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Hello Kate,

I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or 
Mid-Marketer
to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the 
GCP Team.

Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access.

Example Request(s): 

Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)     EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "     EPMI Long Term West Management

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.44)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.



Here are the changes to focus on:

External Exchange fields (Houston Street and True Quote) are now activated.  
(Data can be entered for these fields.)   
Heat Rate Swap deals now display the View Actuals tab for both physical and 
financial deals.  However, only physical deals can be routed.


Please test the application and let me know (by way of email or phone call) 
if Deal Entry is working well, and can be migrated to Production.  We are 
hoping to release it to Prod by tomorrow morning, (December 29, 2000).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.

Mr. Luu,
Nadine and I both tested the prod code against TestN database and have not 
been able to reproduce this, or any other, error.  Is it possible that the 
trader miss-entered the information? Since it was entered yesterday, we 
cannot see exactly what was entered in Blotter.
However, it took greater than 10 minutes for some of the deals to be 
EnPowered.  This is not usually the case, obviously, and I was only doing one 
deal at a time.

I will continue to work on it Monday if you think I should.  Have a good 
weekend.

Good Morning,

When a transmission deal is entered in blotter, for some reason the volume 
also gets put in to the loss column as well, showing us with the full volume 
on one end of the deal, and zero volume on the other.

This happened with two deals today,  deal 535344 and 535343 put into blotter 
by Crandall.  Once the problem was identified, I went into the deal and 
changed the loss volume to zero.

		 Subject: Deal Blotter question

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate

I am planning to come to the Portland Office on Mon., Jan. 22 and Tues., Jan.

everyone in the office.  Melissa is taking over as Lead for me on Power since 
my responsibilities have grown the past few months.  I will still be directly 
responsible for Power Confirmations but am now also responsible for 
management of Physical/Financial Gas Confirmations, Contracts and Financial 
Settlements.  

I was thinking of also bringing someone to do some training on Livelink (the 
document imaging system).  I know that a few of you have been encountering 
problems when using the application.  I would like for this person to see 
they types of problems that you are having so that we can get them fixed.  As 
well, I know that there are a few more advanced features of Livelink that may 
be of interest (i.e. project sharing, etc.).

Let me know you thoughts on this or if you think that it would be beneficial 
to you and others in the office for a Livelink rep. to come with me.  Thanks!

I think that there may be a slight misunderstanding here.

Here are the major differences between Cross-Desk and Cross-Portfolio deals...

Cross-Desk deals are:
? Flagged as desk-to-desk
? NOT scheduled

Cross-Portfolio deals are:
? Flagged as NON-desk-to-desk
? scheduled depending on the deal type (e.g. Forwards are scheduled, 
Emissions are not)

The new deals in question are entered into the system as Cross-Portfolio 
deals because of the WEST - ENAEXEC portfolio relationship.  Because these 
deals were scheduled, they were showing up in Real Time.  By the way, I think 
I was talking to Carla (not Cara) about Real Time.  I apologize about the 
error.  I cannot explain why the deals are not showing up in Forward 
Obligation.

As you said, perhaps Duong Luu can resolve the issue later this week.

Thanks,
Will

I talked to Cara, and she does not agree with what you have stated below.  
She said that cross-desk deals should never show up in real-time position 
manager.  Stacey is also correct,  we have always been able to see 
cross-desks in Forward Obligations - this is not a new development.   Duong 
Luu will be in the Portland office Thursday and Friday,  perhaps we can 
resolve this issue at that time.

I do not understand why they would not show up in forward obligation.  
Currently, forward obs reads from Deal Entry and if they choose the region / 
delivery point that these deals are entered under they should automatically 
show up.  Maybe the forward obs is not recognizing the new portfolio.

Since I am not sure we have resolved this issue yet...

If EnPower is not recognizing the change from WEST-EAST to WEST-WEST... 
EnPower needs to be fixed.  We can manually fix any deals that are still in 
error.

Recently there has been the addition of ENAEXEC.  And some WEST-ENAEXEC deals 
have been created.  
? Should these deals appear in scheduling (according to Cara, they should at 
least show up in Real Time)?  
? Should these deals show up in Forward Obligations?  This is something that 
Portland has hinted at wanting.

Please let me know how we should start handling these new deals.

Thanks,
Will

Stacey,

I think what happened was that originally this deal was entered into with 
ST-NW as the desk and LT-MGMT as the counterparty.  Since LT-MGMT is either 
in the East or Financial Portfolio (I'm not sure - is that Lavorato's book?), 
and ST-NW is in the West Portfolio, it originally showed up as an outside 
counterparty in scheduling.  When the desk got changed to LT-WMGMT (West 
Portfolio), it should have flipped to an interdesk, which does not show up in 
scheduling.  Evidently, it didn't.  

If Enpower won't automatically recognize the change in counterparty 
correctly, I guess we will have to kill the deals and rebook them, rather 
than change the desk.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Monica

wsmith 10-Jan-01:
Sent email to Stacey asking her to explain the difference between cross-desk 
and cross-portfolio deals.

Yes, this is coming up as a consistent problem, these cross-portfolio deals 
are throwing us off balance.  Why are they marked physical? There is no 
delivery.

I don't think these should be marked physical.

Cara,

I noticed that this deal was since changed from cross-portfolio to 
desk-to-desk.  Is there still an issue here?
FYI, all cross-portfolio deals are entered with the scheduled flag set to 
"yes".

please Check that Deal_Schedule_yn flag to no on this.  

We need to fix the underlying bug when we get a chance.  I think it is more 
related to the cross desk deals done with EPMI LT WMGMT instead of EOL

Subject: New EnPower Settlement Indices

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

The World Trade Center Facilities Superintendent has informed us that PGE 
Underground has a main transformer with a bad network protector and is off 
line.  Power needs to be off to replace this network protector.  While this 
situation is inconvenient, it is an excellent opportuity to put our power 
backup systems to a test under optimimal circumstances, e.g., on a Sunday.  
Listed below is information about the outage.  Please review since it may 
require some action on your part.

PGE must turn off its main power supply to the building from 6 - 7 a.m. and 
then again from 3 - 4 p.m.
The building has a backup generator that will kick in five minutes after the 
main power supply shuts off.
Enron has a UPS that will provide us with five minutes worth of power.
If everything goes well, there should be no impact.
If there are problems with the backup generator or UPS, we could experience a 
power outage.
We should not experience a loss of phone service even in the unlikely event 
of a power outage.
It would be prudent to take precautions if you have any systems that may be 
impacted by a power outage.  You may want to log off your computer and turn 
it off on Friday before you leave the office.

Someone from our local IT group will be here on Sunday in case any problems 
arise.  Please contact Dave Steiner if you have any questions or concerns.

Hi Kate,

I hope you had a Happy New Year's.

Sorry we forgot to include you on the initial email.  Could you please 
coordinate the User Acceptance Testing with your group for the various 
reports that were listed below?  As Laura explained, those reports were 
changed to include a field necessary for those deals that came from an  
External Exchange (Houston Street, Dynegy Direct, True Quote) through EOL.

Thanks for all your help.   Please let Laura or myself know if you find any 
problem with the reports.
Nadine.

Hello.  Hope everyone's holiday was pleasant!

Nine reports have been promoted to Stage and are in need of User Acceptance 
Testing.  These reports have not been changed except to add a field that 
allows you to filter in or out the external exchange information, if the deal 
was brought into EnPower via EOL via an external exchange, such as Houston 
Street or True Quote.  EOL is scheduled to start adding these deals very soon 
and we want you to be ready.

To test the reports, please enter deals into the system and add your own EOL 
number, use the dropdown to pick an External Exchange, and add your own 
External Exchange number.  Then you can track your deal through the system.

I have attempted to identify who would normally use these reports, but if I 
am inaccurate, please just reshuffle them to the appropriate party.  And let 
me know where I am wrong so I can make a note for next time.  Also, I do not 
have a list of which reports the Portland office might use so please just 
test the ones you do use.

Good Morning,

Exciting News!!  We now have a new Portland Web based IT incident & tracking 
application to replace the existing Westdeskitissues.mde Access application.  
The new Web based solution adds several key enhancements that will hopefully 
improve IT response time and improve our communications back to you when 
problems are resolved.

Here are some of the key enhancments:
1.  Ability to query outstanding & resolved issues.
2.  IT problem/resolution knowledge base.
3.  Web page that displays important IT contact information.
4.  Automatic email notifications to resolution team members.
4.  And much, much, more.

For those of you who may be new to the office, or may have forgotten about 
the old Westitissues.mde application.  This application is continuously 
monitored by the production support team for infrastructure (PC's, Monitors, 
terminal-server, LAN, WAN, etc) and application (Enpower, Portcalc, CAPS, 
etc.) problems or enhancements requested by users.  This database is also 
summarized to capture metrics which are then used to evaluate the performance 
of the IT group.

Here are the steps to using the new West Desk Problem Tracking System:

New Login:

1. Go to http://westdesksupport/
2. Click the Login button towards the bottom of the page.
3. In the UserName Box, Enter:  ITWD.
4. For the Password type in: Password.
5. On the next Screen, fill out all the information. (Only certain fields are 
required, but filling out everything is preferable)
6. After Clicking the submit button, you are going to be asked to login with 
the new username and password you created in the New User Area.
7. Upon submitting, you will come to the main index page.

Adding a WorkOrder:

1. On the Main index page, click on the link add incident to log under the 
heading of West Desk Links.
2. Fill out as much information as possible. For IT Contact, please enter 
appropriate contact, or if you are not sure, select mtully.
3. Select Priority. (This may be changed by IT)
4. Submit form.

Note: For the description and response fields, you may use html tags for the 
formatting of text for display.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. If you hover your cursor over a link or 
picture or text box, a texttip will appear and tell you what that link or 
textbox is for.

Thanks,

Mike Tully
Trading Floor Support

P.S. When entering a incident, there are two different types of "NEW 
Requests". One is New Request (Problem). This is used for reporting an error 
or problem with an application. The other is New Request (Enhancement) which 
is used for requesting an enhancement to an application.

SRRS Decommissioning Notification

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request=20
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security=20
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security=20
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and=20
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security a=
nd=20
Controls group is working to streamline Enron=01,s Security Request structu=
re=20
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest,=20
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:=
 =20

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt=
=20
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to=
=20
the new eRequest system. =20

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if=

Within the next few months we will be transitioning from our Lotus Notes 
email system to Microsoft Outlook and also upgrading to Windows 2000.  Our 
local IT department and our developmental IT department managers are involved 
in this project and will be coordinating efforts with the software Houston 
transition team to ensure the process goes well in Portland.

Over the course of the next few days, you will be receiving an e-mail from 
Project GEM.  The purpose of this e-mail is to inventory your PC to check for 
hardware and software requirements.  Please open this e-mail only from the PC 
that is your primary one.  This procedure takes under two minutes and will 
assist us in verifying your hardware and software requirements to make your 
transition to Windows 2000 smooth and seamless as possible.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT Department or 
Debra Davidson.

On Tuesday, May 1 we will begin the migration from Lotus Notes to Microsoft 
Outlook.  Your existing emails and folders within Lotus Notes will be 
transferred to Outlook without the loss of any data.

The attached spreadsheet indicates migration date by employee. Training for 
Outlook will be available Wednesday through Friday.  Currently, training 
information is not available, however, we will try to have this information 
to the floor on Monday. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact 
Dave Steiner at ext. 3701.

    Hi Diana & Kate,


    You are not wasting our time, you make our time valuable. You should be 
able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,
    if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes 
insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which
    Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things 
like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.

   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) 
data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with
   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule 
data should be very much the same with all the changes
   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and 
liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and
   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain 
data from 3/22/2001 to 4/5/2001, and the liquidation
   the same data from 4/2/1996. 

   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule 
between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule
   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk. I hided the check box to avoid 
confusions. The option Show Desk is very simple, changes the format
   of the header for Region, nothing else.

   Kroum

Kroum,

I was running the new version of the Obligation Report.  I was not included 
in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still 
not doing what the "fix" was initiated for.  Originally, my discussions with 
Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any 
changes made in Deal Scheduling and  2.  All Desk to Desk deals.  Number 
(2),   I believe was the difficult one.  When selecting the option on "Show 
Deals"  in order to capture schedule changes you must select "Liquidate".  
This does work, but it does not give you the option to select "Show Desk to 
Desk", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.  Please 
contact me for further discussion.  I apologize for not participating and 
wasting your time.  

Sincerely,

Diana Scholtes

Subject: Forward Obligation Report Question

Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Thanks,

Hello Cara,

We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and 
handling time zone issue very well.
Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we 
fixed it since then. All deals that you
provided to us had entered before July 2000.

We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have 
similar problem with time zone.

Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it 
immediately.

Your help is highly appreciated

Regards,
dluu

Subject: AN EOL GLITCH THAT HAS TO DO WITH APRIL DEALS

I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time 
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is 
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something 
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we see 
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of 
these deals are fixed.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

I am particularly worried about how these are corrected because they are long

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Kate, I have done extensive research to obtain the Nymex prices that you have 
requested, and I have concluded the following.
Nymex website does not show a code for Nymex MIDC contract
Nymex Palo Verde (KV), and Nymex COB (MW) do not show settlement prices for 
these power contracts.
Finally, are you sure these are Nymex contracts.
I have checked the Nymex website at: http://www.nymex.com, under Markets, 
Commodity Codes, Futures and Options Data, 
Nymex Divisions Futures Contracts, MIDC, PV, and COB Electricity, Settlement  
Data without results. Stacey White (Enpower Pub Posting), 
Kimat Singla (Risks), and Jeremy Wong (IT), have no idea on the locations of 
the prices  in Nymex.  Can you possibly get
with the trader that made the deal to fill us in on the location to these 
prices, or if he will supply us with the prices that he wants posted?

Thanks, wlh

Subject: New Pub Posting Request

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,

I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Subject: New Pub Posting Request

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Good Morning,

We will be rolling out a new version of Deal Entry & Deal Blotter this 
afternoon to support California scheduling & volume management.  For most of 
the users, there will be no impact except for a few new fields that can be 
ignored in Enpower's Deal Entry.  Below is a list of the changes:


Deal Entry (These fields should only be populated for California deals)
1.  Added Settlement Entity - Identifies where the power is scheduled and 
settled.

2.  Added Sched Coordinator - Identifies the coordinator responsible for 
scheduling the power.

3.  Schedule Type - Defines the type of schedule used in California.

4.  Market Reference - Defines the market when the power will flow.

Deal Blotter 
1.  Deal Blotter will be defaulting these 4 values if the deal is in 
California.

Thanks,  David Poston

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.

    Cara,

   Thanks a lot for the detail error report.
   Actually to me is enough to see the selection screen and the numbers of 
the deals
   which are missing or are extra on the report.


   1) I can see that you are running the older version of the report, because 
there is selection
for Approval on the screen. Probably is our mistake. The shortcut does not 
update the new
version. You need to run the STAGE Enpower launchpad with all the buttons at 
first which
will copy the new version of Forward Obligation from the server to your local 
computer
at first and then to run the shortcut.

  2) I run the newer version here, I can see the parts of the deals 503112 
and 503107
which you have highlited and the region totals were zero's. You can verify it.


 3) We just released a new version to stage, which should have the same 
reasults, but we
did some optimizations, we intend to reduce the speed soon.
The version number is 3.0.0.36, you can see it when you run the report or 
click Help-About.
Until you don't see that number there is no use to continue testing, on any 
problem
call David Poston


    Thanks,
    Kroum

Subject: Test of Forward Obligation

Good Morning,

I ran the new report against production, using the shortcut provided for me. 
My results are innacurate because some transmission deals are not showing. 
The strange thing is that there is no real pattern as to why some 
transmission deals show and some don't.

I compared the forward ob to scheduling.   You might want to do that 
comparison for yourself there.  Also, checking the Real-Time position manager 
as well will help.

Please see this power point document.

Hi Kate, Cara,

I'm the new Enpower QA here in Houston, replacing Nadine who has moved on to 
another project.  There was a bug found in the Fwd Obl report, concerning the 
desk choice disappearing after the report has been ran.  Corry Bentley here 
in Houston has looked at the fix and I would like for you two to have a 
chance to view it also before moving it to production.  It is currently in 
Stage, and as soon as you both get a chance to test it, and give it your ok, 
I can get it moved to production.  If you have any questions please e-mail me 
back, or feel free to call.

Thanks a lot,

Brett Pate

Kate,

Donnie is looking at this.  As long as Willie is pulling in the requested 
information, we can set up the pub code in EnPower.  Jenny.

I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday 
afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send 
out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request, 
but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of 
commmand?

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: New Pub Posting Request

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

Please note the following changes:
We would like to know the approximate number of attendees for the morning 
sessions, so please be sure to let me know which of the two sessions you are 
interested in attending.
The afternoon session will begin at 1:00pm, rather than 12:00pm
In order to keep the "flow" of traffic moving through Mt. Hood, please plan 
on stopping by at the top of the hour (1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Hello Kate,

In order for Power Traders to gain access to Power Desks, my team, 
GCP_Houston, must link their names to each Desk.
(Basically, we need a list of desks that the Traders need access.)

Please provide the following info:

Example(s): 

Add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)    EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "    EPMI Long Term West Management

Please submit your request(s) to GCP_Houston, (this is my entire team).

Best Rgds.

Samuel

Subject: New Trader IDs

The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe 
you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I 
should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their 
own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two 
marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over 
the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a 
trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.

Thank you,
Kate

All,

As requested, I have schedulled 10 minutes downtime for PWRPROD1 tonight from 
10:00pm until 10:10pm.

The purpose is to increase the maximum number of processes from 500 into 800.

In the last 1 week, the max number of processes was exceeded twice, so we 
need to resolve this problem as soon as possible.

Please forward this information to anyone who should be notified.

Thank you.

Tantra.

Hello Kate,

I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or 
Mid-Marketer
to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the 
GCP Team.

Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access.

Example Request(s): 

Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)     EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "     EPMI Long Term West Management

Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would 
be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will 
potentially do deals with all of the traders -

Long Term Southwest
Long Term Northwest
Long Term California
Long Term West Management

Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Thanks,

As most of you know we have been experiencing some problems with our 
Network.  Tonight starting at 7:30 Cisco doing some troubleshooting with our 
Networking team in Houston.  I have co-ordinated the outages with the Real 
Time Schedulers.  

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Diana

Brett -

I'm so sorry for not sending you an e-mail last night! I did test the report 
and it looks just fine - but I had so many things going on right up until I 
left that I forgot to tell YOU that it looked fine. Thanks for the reminder, 
and for your work on the report.

Kate

Kate, were you able to test the Fwd Obligation Report?  Mr. Luu is ready to 
push it in to production, but we wanted you to look at it and give it your ok 
first.  

Thanks,

Please note the following changes:
We would like to know the approximate number of attendees for the morning 
sessions, so please be sure to let me know which of the two sessions you are 
interested in attending.
The afternoon session will begin at 1:00pm, rather than 12:00pm
In order to keep the "flow" of traffic moving through Mt. Hood, please plan 
on stopping by at the top of the hour (1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm, 5pm).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Grace

Kroum,

Users are having difficulty deleting term strips in Deal Entry due to the 
existence of deal_strip_setlmt_ext records.  Is Deal Entry supposed to delete 
these records explicitly or are we supposed to have a trigger in place to 
handle this?

Thanks,
Will
