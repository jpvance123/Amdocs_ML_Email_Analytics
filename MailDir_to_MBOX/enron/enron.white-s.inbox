Everything is usually dated as of the last business day.  We definitely publish and export as of the last business day, and usually, we just do a file save as of the dpr as of the last day of the month.  All clear?!

Casey,

Can you remind me of all this?

Good questions, when I figure it out I will add to the Month End Procedures.

Just as confirmation, is the last pwrdpr for the month dated as the last business day or the day of the calculation? Also, do we export for the last business day or the effective date?

Subject:	Power Month End Procedures


In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

Jeff, please ask your assistant to enter all data but not to submit the churn.  The only thing that would change is the final location for that person.  

Thanks a million for the quick turnaround!

Attached are the excel floor plans with this morning's information.  Please utilize these as a working tool to put names on seats.  Hopefully Presto and Lavorato will not make major changes to the layout.  

Operations on the 6th floor are between 401 and 494.

Please phone me with any questions.

I am attaching the Form A for Power (East and West combined).  I am also attaching a copy of our 11/30 DPR and a reconciliation from the total MTM per the Form A  to the life-to-date forward MTM per the DPR (DPR and reconciliation are on two separate tabs).  

Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

 I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:

1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) . 

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of "Unify" for instance, will be too broad.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

Steve

Dear All,

	After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

	Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.

To prepare for the simulation test that will run this week, can you please make sure the necessary people in your group have the appropriate access to the UBS application to perform their job function.  For example, I know that the Reports application was used by most groups and that the risk groups also used the Bridge Monitor application.

Although we are not expecting any problems to arise, please let me know of any issues your group has logging onto the system.  Thank you for your help!

This document illustrates what my group does, what I expect will be needed from my group in a new entity ("NewCo") and lastly what will be needed to wind down/sell the remaining businesses ("OldCo").

I believe that a risk controls group is needed as part of NewCo not only to issue consolidated reporting, but to perform analysis of risk data and maintain the analytic systems.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

 

Best regards

We have postponed issuing the DPR until the terminations that have already been entered into are appropriately reflected in the risk books.  My aim is to produce a full preliminary DPR next Monday for this Friday's trading activity.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

Kim,

I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the west.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks!
Casey

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

The Word of the Day for December 21 is:

solstice   \SAHL-stiss or SOHL-stiss\   (noun)
     : the time of year when the sun is farthest north of the
equator or farthest south of the equator

Example sentence:
     Ancient astronomers from many lands used the summer and
winter solstices to mark the turning of the seasons in their
calendars.

Did you know?
     "Solstice" owes much to a merry old "sol" -- the Latin noun
"sol," meaning "sun." The ancients added "sol" to "-stitium"
(from "status," the past participle of the verb "sistere,"
meaning "to come to a standstill"). That's because for several
days around the time of the solstices, the sun's appearance on
the horizon at sunrise and sunset seems to occur at the same
spot, before it starts drifting to the north or south again.
Speakers of Old French adapted "solstitium" to form "solstice,"
and Middle English speakers borrowed the term during the 13th
century. In the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs
on June 21 or 22 and the winter solstice on December 21 or 22.
In the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are reversed, the
solstices are exactly the opposite.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on
December 24, 25, or 26.  The full text for each day's word will

>From Kevin Presto:

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).

The transmission agreement list attached can be used to prioritize or assign commercial people to transmission/pool agreements.  It is not correct on the timing under the pools, so don't rely on that column.

 

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

Stacey,

Not sure if you want to call Lloyd or not, but in addition to Bloomberg, Amerex and Truequote, you can get viewing rights to EOL through e-request.  I'll keep looking and let you know if I get any others.

I work in global risk and am looking for a listing of online quote sites for power. I was hoping you may have some sites (Xotchil thought you may).  Could you forward me the addresses of sites you use.

As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!  

Thanks!

Hi Will,
per my phone message, we are having difficulties now with 3 not 2 deals with respect to their contract numbers.  The recent deal is # 832413 for Vornweg Waterpower.  Again, contract number 96063077 appears under the deal clearing tab.  This is the incorrect contract number and I the correct one is not under the Global contract number dropdown box, which it usually is with our Ontario deals.  Can you please help me with this problem as soon as you have a minute.

Thanks,
Brad

Here is the tentative schedule for the rest of the month.  Let me know if there are any problems with it.  I didn't put anything for the last day of the month or the first day of January as we don't know what will be going on those two days at this point.

Key Issue For Int/FX Process Day 1 : 
1) We need a business person in Houston to validate the interpolation process and the business process flow. This needs to be completed today. Jeff Gossett has agreed to do this if no one is yet assigned. He will check with Lavarado to see if they have designated an owner of Int/FX processes. If this person is designated, Jeff will put this person in touch with Brad Merrell to complete this task. 

Interest / FX Curves -- The process 'Day 1' is briefly as follows: 
1) UBS will Email the officialized curve data at the end of each business day. For now, we will only use the officialized UBS curves. The downside in the short run is that this data won't be recieved until 5:30 PM. We will obviously be working on a process with UBS to accelerate this process. 
2) The Int/FX curve data from UBS is not in a monthly format and they cannot generate a monthly format. As such, we have created a spreadsheet that takes these inputs and generates an interpolated monthly curve. 
3) These curves will be manually uploaded into ERMS
4) ERMS will feed the downstream systems as it has in the past
5) For those systems that interfaced to Infinity for Int/FX data, we will have to process manual updates. We have identified Laura Scott and Cheryl Dawes in Canada for Unify. We will designate a person to do the same for the SAP system. We will designate a person to do the same process for Enpower. This will be closed today and documented in the process flow. 

Upcoming Milestones: 
1) The interpolation spreadsheet is completed. It is being unit and string tested and reviewed by IT today. We are ready for a business person to review and approve this now. 
2) Brad Merrell is completing the business process flow documentation. Owners of the various steps in the manual process are being defined. This will be completed today. A draft will be sent out and reviewed this PM
3) We will test the process tomorrow in the 'Mock Mock' test as well as the official test on Thursday. 

Thanks.

Subject:	Interest Rate Curves

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

Andy can trade all regions and all commodities (just like a desk head).    He is replacing Harry.

Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper?  Any other books needed for him?  Will he be allowed to trade all regions?

Thanks,

Can you send me (or tell me what directory) the spreadsheet provided to you by Michael for ERCOT Imbalances.  I have a meeting Friday to go over how the volume management group and risk groups interface and what data is shared between the two.  So anything you can tell me would be helpful.

The Word of the Day for December 28 is:

undertaker   \un-der-TAY-ker or (particularly in sense 2)
UN-der-tay-ker \   (noun)
     1 : one that undertakes : one that takes the risk and
management of business : entrepreneur
     *2 : one whose business is to prepare the dead for burial

Example sentence:
     "[He] recalled a family friend, an undertaker, who allowed
him to roam free through his funeral home." (Mike Harden, _The
Columbus Dispatch_, November 19, 2001).

Did you know?
     You may wonder how the word "undertaker" made the transition
from "one who undertakes" to "one who makes a living in the
funeral business." The latter meaning descends from the use of
the word to mean "one who takes on business responsibilities."
In the 18th century, a funeral-undertaker was someone who
undertook, or managed, a funeral business. There were many
undertakers in those days, undertaking all sorts of businesses,
but as time went on "undertaker" became specifically identified
with the profession of burial. Today, "funeral director" is more
commonly used, but "undertaker" still appears.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

The Word of the Day for October 27 is:

nyctalopia   \nik-tuh-LOH-pee-uh\   (noun)
     : night blindness

Example sentence:
     George's nyctalopia gives him a tendency to walk into
furniture unless he turns on all the lights.

Did you know?
     "Nyctalopia" comes to us from the Latin word "nyctalops,"
which means "suffering from night blindness." It is ultimately
derived from the Greek word "nyktalops," which was formed by
combining the word for "night" ("nyx") with the words for
"blind" and "eye" ("alaos" and "ops," respectively). English
speakers have been using "nyctalopia" to refer to reduced
vision in faint light or at night since the 17th century. We
added the somewhat more pedestrian "night blindness" to the
lexicon in the 18th century.

Dear Stacey,

First of all, I need thank you for good common you have given to me. I believe that is an main reason why I still can work for Enron. 

As today's Netco list. I am not in that list. I have talked to Steve Nat. He told me I am last person he took out from the list. He is going to try to add me to the list. He told me there is still possible to add one or two persons to the list.
 
After reading the list. I found there are 25 Gas people in Netco list and only 24 Power people in Netco list.
I believe there still is possibility to ask for one more position for power people.
 
There are many types Excel reports for your groups. I believe your group definitely need high level Excel VBA to support and develop those reports.
 
Some people in Netco power list do know Excel, even Visual Basic, but Excel+Visual Basic is far away from high level Excel VBA and there is no Excel VBA for Netco Power list.  I was a Access VBA before I joined Enron, but at very beginning I had a lot of trouble for Excel VBA. Mr. Zhiyong Wei once worked on Excel VBA (I took his Excel VBA responsibility after I joined Enron) he knows that position very well. Also his (gas) Excel term has 3 persons. Two are with Sr. title and one Spec.  If Excel VBA is not necessary for our system he definitely doesn't want three high level persons. This summer Mr. Wei told Sanjay at front of whole my group that "Min is busiest person in your group".  He knows my responsibility and he has seen how hard I am working. He knows my working hours even more than his. 
 
This year I not only have developed a lot of Excel applications, but also have optimized applications and made them much more stable than I took the responsibility.  I was over booked for long time. I take care 90% of Excel Support and develop for your group. Sanjay always promised me to hire more persons ASAP. Excel in power did have three persons as Gas on 12/2/2001. In my first Enron year, I lived in The Woodlands. At that period,  most of time I took 202 bus to work, but not Bus from Woodlands because I typically needed worked >10 hours every day and last 202 bus is 10pm, but Woodlands is 7pm. I often took last bus of 202. Sometimes, I missed my last bus or sometimes there are too many works. I even worked whole night at my desk.
 
Excel VBA job market is very small. Only trading companies need high level Excel VBA. Since that, not many people want to be that area. Companies which need Excel VBA have extremely hard time to hire good Excel VBA. For e.g. Sanjay had waited for more than 8 months and interviewed dozens people before he got Steve Skornia. On other hands, Excel VBA also have extremely hard time to find a job. 
 
I only have moved to Houston for 1.5 year. I just buy a house and two new cars. I have two children with age 4 and 2. I have given up my personal life and family life and contributed all my energy to Enron. If I lost my job, that will be disaster for me and my family. 
 
My appreciations is more than any words can express if you could continue to give your nice common in case some one ask whether you need a Excel VBA.
 
Merry Christmas to you and your family.
 
Min Zheng

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 20 is:

flippant   \FLIH-punt\   (adjective)
     : lacking proper respect or seriousness

Example sentence:
     When Candice asked her nephew where he'd been, he replied
with a flippant "Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies."

Did you know?
     "Flippant" did something of a flip-flop shortly after it
appeared in English in the 17th century. "Flippant" was probably
created from the verb "flip," which in turn likely originated as
an imitation of the sound of something flipping. The earliest
senses of the adjective were "nimble" and "limber." One could be
flippant not only on one's feet, but also in speech -- that is,
someone "flippant" might have a capacity for easy, flowing
speech. Such "flippancy" was considered a good thing at first.
But people who speak freely and easily can sometimes seem too
talkative, even impertinent. By the end of the 18th century, the
positive sense of "flippant" had slipped from use, and the
"disrespectful" sense had taken its place.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on
December 24, 25, or 26.  The full text for each day's word will

Attached are the excel floor plans with this morning's information.  Please utilize these as a working tool to put names on seats.  Hopefully Presto and Lavorato will not make major changes to the layout.  

Operations on the 6th floor are between 401 and 494.

Stacey, talked to Tim and all traders can trade all regions. So Mike Swerzbin's trading book is NW but he can trade anywhere in CA or SW. Does that answer your question?

The Word of the Day for December 27 is:

hackle   \HAK-ul\   (noun)
     1 : one of the long feathers on the neck or back of a bird
     2 plural : hairs (as on a dog's neck) that can be erected
    *3 plural : temper, dander

Example sentence:
     Paul's letter to the editor, which referred to "the sorry
state of our public schools," raised some hackles among local
teachers.

Did you know?
     In its earliest uses in the 15th century, "hackle" denoted
either a bird's neck plumage or an instrument used to comb out
long fibers of flax, hemp, or jute. Apparently, some folks saw a
resemblance between the neck feathers of domestic birds --
which, on a male, become erect when the bird is defensive -- and
the prongs of the comb-like tool. In the 19th century, English
speakers extended the word's use to both dogs and people. Like
the bird's feathers, the erectile hairs on the back of a dog's
neck stand up when the animal is agitated. With humans, use of
the word "hackles" is usually figurative. When you raise
someone's hackles, you make them angry or put them on the
defensive.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Creditors Ask Bankruptcy Judge to Delay Sale of Enron's Trading Business      
Updated: Wednesday, January 9, 2002 12:32 PM ET      
Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Even before an auction of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s trading business later this week, creditors are lining up to oppose the sale. 
Creditors are concerned about how Enron (ENE, news, msgs) will allocate money from that auction to its bankrupt units, and are asking federal bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to oppose, or at least delay, an approval of the sale, which was to come as early as Friday.  
More than 15 companies have now filed motions asking the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to delay the approval of any offer for Enron's power-trading business, which was by far the largest and most profitable operation of the vast company. The companies want time to figure out which assets are up for sale, which of the more than 3,000 Enron affiliates and other entities will benefit from the sale and how various creditors will be affected. 
Under a plan to bring back some value to its now moribund trading operations, including EnronOnline -- which until not so long ago accounted for 25% of all wholesale energy trading in the U.S. -- Enron is seeking a 51% joint-venture partner to form a new company dubbed New Energy Trading Company, or NETCO. 
Enron plans to contribute its trading software and hardware, among other things, to the joint venture in exchange for a 49% share. So far, Citigroup Inc. (C, news, msgs) and UBS AG (UBS, news, msgs) have been reported to have made sealed bids. An auction is scheduled for Thursday. 
At stake is how cash that may potentially be generated by the sale will be used. 
In its motion opposing the sale, for instance, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBSB, news, msgs) said, "Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries." 
Further scrutinizing the way Enron has been managing its cash, the Royal Bank of Scotland, one of Enron's large creditors, raises the possibility that Enron may have already consolidated cash between different entities before it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
"If this anecdote were to be correct, no disclosure has been made [nor has the time necessary to conduct a review elapsed] to the extent, if any, that any of these businesses stand as a constructive trustee of assets or monies for the benefit of other entities or creditors," the Royal Bank of Scotland stated in a court filing. 
Gas and electricity trading company Aquila Inc. also expressed concerns about the use of the proceeds of the trading-assets sale, saying that proceeds of the sale should be put in escrow until it can be determined which units should get the money. 
It isn't the first time that questions have arisen about how Enron will distribute money coming into the company. 
Last month, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER, news, msgs) briefly withheld $371 million of the distressed company's funds in a brokerage account until Enron and the bankruptcy court could clarify which of the company's entities was entitled to it. 
The court's verdict: The money will be governed by a centralized cash- management system - put in place shortly after Enron filed for bankruptcy - under which all funds collected by any Enron entity are swept up to the parent and later dispersed accordingly to subsidiaries. 
For now, this means that any cash generated on settlements to Enron's units should be used to pay those units' debtors. 
But that could change, according to bankruptcy experts, if Enron decides in the future to effect a "substantive consolidation" of its assets. This is relatively common in Chapter 11 cases, and in essence, would put all of the company's assets into one pot to be distributed to a larger circle of creditors. 
A substantive consolidation, if it eventually occurs, is likely to simplify Enron's role in dispersing funds, but may benefit some creditors and put others at a disadvantage. 
Given that the Chapter 11 proceedings are still in the early stages, it is difficult to gauge whether this is a viable option, said Joel Kay, an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy cases at Hughes, Watters & Askanase LLP, Houston. 
Enron attorneys didn't immediately return phone calls seeking comment. 
There is also another concern. 
Wiser Oil Co. (WZR, news, msgs), a creditor who is owed about $7 million under oil- and gas-hedging contracts with the Enron North America unit, believes that Enron's $ 1.5 billion debtor-in-possession financing could mean bad news for the beleaguered company's subsidiary. 
"The concern is that Enron North America's assets are being pledged as collateral to secure repayment of the DIP facility even though it's unclear how much, if any, of the DIP borrowing will actually go to this unit," said Deborah A. Reperowitz, of Reed Smith LLP, which represents Wiser. 
So far, Enron hasn't drawn on its DIP facility, which is led by J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. But if the company does, and there are insufficient funds to repay this loan in the future, then Enron North America's assets may be on the hook, according to Ms. Reperowitz. 
Wiser, in a filing late Tuesday, also objected to the court's expected approval of the sale of a portion of Enron's energy-trading unit. Energy trading accounted for about 90% of Enron's $101 billion in revenue last year. 
The sale shouldn't be allowed to go through because the "timing and terms" make it impossible for creditors to determine which assets are to be sold, the value of these assets and where proceeds will be allocated, Wiser said. 
Other entities that have expressed concern about the sale in recent court filings include General Electric Co.'s (GE, news, msgs) General Electric Capital Corp., Pure Resources Inc. (PRS, news, msgs), Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Forest Oil Corp. (FST, news, msgs), Devon Energy Corp. (DVN, news, msgs), Magnum Hunter Production Inc., Petro-Hunt LLC and Spinnaker Exploration Co. (SKE, news, msgs), Exco Resources Inc. (EXCO, news, msgs), Eco-Tankship Inc., Powerex Corp., and El Paso Corp.'s (EPG, news, msgs) El Paso Merchant Energy LP.

Things You Won't See On Hallmark Cards...

OUTSIDE: As the days go by, I think of how lucky I am...
INSIDE:  That you're not here to ruin it for me.

OUTSIDE: If I get only one thing for Christmas...
INSIDE:  I hope it's your sister.

OUTSIDE: I've always wanted to have someone to hold, someone to love.
INSIDE:  After having met you, I've changed my mind.

OUTSIDE: I must admit, you brought religion into my life.
INSIDE:  I never believed in hell 'til I met you.

OUTSIDE: Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help but wonder...
INSIDE:  What the fuck was I thinking?

OUTSIDE: I always wanted to be rich, powerful and well-respected.
INSIDE:  And while I'm dreaming, I wish you weren't so damn ugly.

OUTSIDE: Sex with you is like using drugs:
INSIDE:  Lots of people do it, but nobody's stupid enough to admit it.

OUTSIDE: When we were together, you always said you'd die for me.
INSIDE:  Now that we've broken up, I think it's time you kept your promise.

OUTSIDE: The holidays are a great time to be with family.
INSIDE:  Of course, your family won't be with you, since I'm taking the kids and moving in with my sister, you cheating bastard!

OUTSIDE: I'm so miserable without you...
INSIDE:  It's almost like you're here.

OUTSIDE: If you ever need a friend...
INSIDE:  Buy a dog.

OUTSIDE: Congratulations on your new bundle of joy.
INSIDE: Did you ever find out who the father was?

This file contains the same information that I emailed you earlier, but I have combined it for both the East and West if you need the information presented that way.

Dear Santa,
I wud like a kool toy space ranjur for Xmas. Iv ben a good boy all
yeer.
YeR FReND, BiLLy
Dear Billy,
Nice spelling. You're on your way to being a career lawn-care
specialist. How bout I send you a fucking book so you can learn to
read and write?  I'm  giving your older brother the space ranger, at
least HE can spell!
Santa
Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love,   Sarah
Dear Sarah,
Your mother smoked a lot of pot while she was pregnant with you,
didn't she?
Santa
Dear Santa,
I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck.
Please, I really really want a fire truck this year!
Love, Joey
Dear Joey,
Let me make it up to you. While you sleep, I'm gonna torch your
house. You'll have more fire trucks than you'll know what to
do with.
Santa
Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for
my mommy and daddy to get back together. Please see what you 
can do.
Love, Teddy
Dear Teddy,
What, and ruin that hot affair your dad's still having with the
babysitter? He's banging her like a screen door in a hurricane, son!
Let meget you some nice Legos instead.
Santa
Dear Santa,
I need more Pokemon cards please! All my friends have more
Pokemon cards than me. Please bring me some.
Love, Michelle
Dear Michelle,
It blows my fucking mind. Kids are forcing their parents to buy
hundreds of dollars worth of these stupid cards, and none of
you snot-nosed brats are even learning to play the game.
Let me get you something more your speed, like "Chutes and Ladders."
Santa
Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love, Francis
Dear Francis,
Who the hell names their kid "Francis" nowadays?
Santa
Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left
carrots for your reindeer outside the backdoor.
Love, Susan
Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the shits and carrots make the deer fart in my
face. You want to be a kiss-ass? Leave me a glass of Chivas 
Regal and some Toblerone.
Santa
Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are you making
toys?
Your friend, Thomas
Dear Thomas,
All the toys get made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most my time squeezing cocktail waitresses asses, and
losing all my cash at the craps table.
Santa
Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, like in the song?
Love, Jessica
Dear Jessica,
No, but I watch your mommy when she's in the shower. When 
you get older and grow titties, I'll be watching you, too.
Santa
Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE,
Timmy
Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
don't work up here. You're getting a sweater again.
Santa
Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love, Marky
Mark,
First, stop calling yourself "Marky," that's why you're getting
your ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house, that's
a low-rent apartment complex you're living in. Third, I get inside 
your pad just like all the burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams!
Santa

To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.  

Thanks,
Mike Croucher

I thought Mid C was R9 and WSCC-N was B8?
Thank you for your help.
Evidently they are looking at removing BPA deal, and we wanted to understand the changes in VAR because of it.

Attached is the file you are trying to reconcile, which I've already reconciled.  Reconciled is New file.1,  Old file is EnronVarcurveshift II

Care to grab lunch?

Hi Stacey:

  We were able to pull out the P&L vs Counter Party for the four Post IDs, and the total matched the $986,414,195 you gave, it seems that there are more counterparties than what you included in the spreadsheet.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for details.

 

  Could you let us know how the number in your spreadsheet was generated?  Was it from DPR or some other spreadsheet?  Maybe we can take a look at the query to see if something is missed.

  Thanks,

- Zhiyun

	All,

	Based on conversations with IT, I believe a better solution is to leave the estate version of RMS as is. Since the Netco version of RisktRAC is on schedule for delivery,  I see no gain in populating the estate database with Netco books. Curves will be brought into the Netco version as part of the static data migration.

	In an effort to help with the Netco setup, IT has prepared an Excel template for populating the data required for book creation. Jeff and Stacey will lead the effort to get these spreadsheets populated with all the information required to set up the new books for Netco. Once the Netco version of RisktRAC is up and running, IT will load these spreadsheets and systematically create the new books at that time. 

	I am attaching the template from IT. Jeff and Stacey's teams will need support and training as to the proper population of each of these fields. Perhaps one of your group could take a few minutes to write some basic rules for data population and forward to the new users?

	I hope this alternative will allow the best use of all of our time as we try to get through the requirements for the next couple of weeks. Please respond with  questions or comments.

	Thanks,
	
	Debbie

Subject:	NETCO access to RisktRAC

Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

Thanks

The Power desks were set up with the identifier as NETCO as part of the name to keep them separate from the old book names. The set up was done originally in the Estate Environ. before the systems were split.  The name can be changed to lose the NETCO ref. if need be.  Hope this clarifies the many email attachments below!

The majority of the book names have the NETCO name in them.  Is this going to change?  Those names were given to us to add as books in our system.  Please advise ASAP in case we need to change in our database applications.

These NETCO references should not have been part of the test.  
After today, the upstream source needs to remove (or rename) to their real name.  NetCo named testing was for last week only.

Wednesday and Thursday testing should not use these desks.

All,

This issue has been resolved. The problem is that there are two desks should include in our counterparty list, however, it's not there
DUNS_LINK_ID		CP_NM					COUNTER_PARTY_CD
166974			NETCO Long Term Managemet		NETCO-LT-MGMT

Andrea,
I'm hearing from David Poston that EOL deals were sent down with old desks (?) that kicked out of EnPower.

David,
Attached is what EOL sent, please verify these loaded.
What data did EOL send down incorrectly?  We need to fix for the Wednesday and Thursday test.

 << File: trans summary 020402 POWER.xls >> 

I'm also hearing from Lori that the deals were not scheduled?  Who does this, and I assume we need to reschedule for the new data?

Andrea,
Can you verify the spreadsheet of the deals you processed for Power, and send your updates back?

 << File: 0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls >> 


Thanks.  The goal is to have these settled in Unify for SAP transmission at 1pm.

Regan-

I'm still having a problem seeing those deals in Deal Entry.  If I run a search, it tells me that there are 'no records selected', which is very strange as I know there are at least 20 deals in there that have been entered by either myself or the EOL testers.  Any ideas?

Kathy,
I'm still working to get authorization to create hierarchy in Risktrac, in the meantime can you create the hierarchies?  I think in NETCO we are going to do away with the Burton McIntyre function and have it reside at risk level, this way it is done correctly.   Ramesh is working to provide a separate Risktrac system for NETCO in which to create the hierarchy.  

Ramesh, would it be ok for now to have the Risk function create a NETCO hierarchy in Risktrac then copy that hierarchy over into NETCO  once the "clean" version was complete?

Subject:	NETCO Portfolio Book Structure

In considering setting up books for NETCO,  RAC needs the following:  (I recognize portfolio name choice may not be optimal)
1.	Ownership of ERMS and Enpower
o	For Canada, it would probably be best if ownership resided in Houston (Peggy, any feedback would be helpful)
2.	Recognizing that portfolio hierarchy may need to be augmented pending buyers request, I recommend three portfolio structures.
o	Trading portfolio (heterogeneous, incl. everything traders trade) - 2 portfolio's (power & gas) aggregated under NETCO total
?	Trader (sub portfolio by risk type) , regional, parent portfolio  (includes all commodities in traders portfolio)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas Trading
?	Financial Desk
?	Arnold
o	Price
o	Basis
o	Exotics
o	Power Trading
?	East Power
?	Presto
o	Long term
o	Short term
o	Commodity portfolio Gas and Power (homogenous)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Gas Power
?	East
?	West
o	Northwest
o	Southwest
?	Gas Gas
?	Financial
?	West 
?	Etc.
o	Power 
?	Power Gas
?	Power Power
o	Curve portfolio grouped regionally - This portfolio does not currently exist.  
?	Starts with curves, regional, root portfolio, parent 
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Northeast
?	Transco Z6
?	etc
o	Power
?	Northeast
?	NEPOOL
?	Etc.

Additionally, we need to correct curve shift reporting in Risktrac as well as bench mark positions.  In the past Canada was "grandfathered" under its legacy transactions, but under NETCO there should not be any legacy deals and as such Canada needs to report its risk the same as we do in Houston.  PortCalc may need to be modified to handle currency issues and other as well as new curves may need to be created.  When creating new curves, please copy in ERMS 90 days worth of price history so that we can measure VAR. 

I apologize if this is vague, please feel free to provide feedback.

Thanks
Frank

I see you two ( or your delegates) being the approvers of users for RisktRAC, outside of Credit and Market risk requirements.  Please take a look at what Ramesh put together...I foresee a few changes but would like your input as well.
 
We also need to talk about plans for book/portfolio set ups. Do you have time tomorrow morning to get together?

Debbie,
This is a list of users I think we should start out with in the NETCO databases and our applications. This list of users connect directly to the Oracle database and have access to RisktRAC(VB). Web users need not have an account on the Oracle databases. I have not considered that list at this point in time.
 
Please take a look at this list and let me know whether anyone else should be added/deleted.
 
Andrew,
I will be in tomorrow very early. I will leave between 10:45 and 11:00AM. I have to attend a Jeff Johnson meeting.

The Word of the Day for December 30 is:

balneology   \bal-nee-AH-luh-jee\   (noun)
     : the science of the therapeutic use of baths

Example sentence:
     Dori studied balneology in Europe and now applies her
knowledge at a spa in the U.S.

Did you know?
     "Sure, the hot water feels good. Sure, the massage is nice.
But it goes beyond that, advocates say." So wrote Ellen Creager
in an article published on February 18, 2001 in the _Detroit
Free Press_. The healing powers of mineral baths have long been
touted by advocates like those mentioned by Creager. Though
we've had the word "balneology" for just over 120 years, this
method of treating aching muscles, joint pain, and skin ailments
goes back to ancient times. Proponents of the science of bath
therapy created the name "balneology" from Latin "balneum"
("bath") and "-logy" ("science"). Today, some medical institutes
in Europe have departments of balneology. Modern "balneologists"
impart their knowledge to, or themselves serve as,
"balneotherapists," who apply their "balneotherapy" to grateful
clients.

I am forwarding Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU.  Please calculate our MTM values on those dates as soon as you can, and forward them to me.  Thank you.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.

For those of you I have not told, my brother Eric was recently laid off
from Siemens out of Atlanta.  He is looking for a sales position,
especially in the field of medical devices.  He is leaving open the option
of  moving back to Texas if he is able to find employment here.  I am
including a brief paragraph he wrote about his experience.

I would love to have my brother, sister 'n law, little niece, and unborn
child back in Texas.  If you know of any contacts in the medical device
field, please let me know and my brother will send them his resume.

Jason, my husband, is still looking for a job also!  He is looking for
pharmaceutical sales, but is also leaving his options open for other sales
opportunities in Dallas!

Thank you for your help during this difficult time!

Hope all is well with everyone!

Chris

>From Eric:
I am an accomplished sales professional with 10 years experience developing
and implementing technology-based solutions.  I have direct sales
experience
with national accounts and have managed a sales force in the Southeastern
region of the U.S.

Over the years, I have had outstanding success building and maintaining
relationships with key corporate decision makers and I've established
large-volume, high-profit accounts with excellent levels of retention and
loyalty.

I've spent my entire career with Moore Products Co., which was recently
acquired by Siemens.  Due to the economic conditions and restructuring at
Siemens I am leaving the company and I'm seizing this opportunity to apply
my high-tech professional sales skills into the medical device industry.

Do you know anyone in this market that could provide me more information
about companies in this industry or any companies looking for people with
my
skills?

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

Susie-

The attached file details the Wind position at January 31, 2001.  I apologize for the delay...I was having trouble with the curves that I needed in order to recalc, but was able to resolve the problem.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Day1 requirements - RisktRAC operations

1) User List 
Need to gather list of all employees that will be using risktRAC for book administration, verify list, then ensure they are setup in the RisktRAC database.
(related to 3) Security Access).

2) Migrate users to Netco
Need to check with network security and/or integration team to find out when the users IDs will be
converted to run on the Netco network.  (Dependency for running RisktRAC on Netco).

3) Security Access
Work with Stephanie to follow up with Security on approval for RisktRAC application: confirm groups and approvers.  	Ensure everyone who does not have RisktRAC will have an e-request submitted.

4) RisktRAC Training
Once users have access to Netco RisktRAC setup timeframe for basic training.  If time permits a hands-on overview could also be arranged, as long as someone can access the Netco RisktRAC from their desk (either user or developer).

5) Website connectivity: 
Distribute RAC website URL to Netco employees 
(confirmed with Bhupesh - http://rac.netco.enron.com )

6) Disable Spreadsheet Position loading: 
In RisktRAC disable the ability to load exotic spreadsheets for Day1 users.

7) Day1 Portfolio Hierarchy
(This step can occur before the books are loaded into RisktRAC.)

Review with Frank Hayden the ideal portfolio hierarchy that should be setup, then have users start building the structure without any associations to real portfolios.
The book-portfolio tie-in will occur with action item 8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet.

8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet
a) Discuss timeline for loading Day1 book data from the book-setup spreadsheet;
    Discuss validation issues and cutoff for loading data.
    Note expected book counts are 164 for Gas and approximately 55 - 60 for Power.

b) Add two columns in the spreadsheet for portfolio creation and hierarchy placement, have users fill in this data with guidance from IT.

9)  Control RisktRAC screen-access
Discuss necessary business groups and screen-access to setup in RisktRAC:  Gas Users, Power Users, Credit Users, Market-Risk Users, any other groups that come to mind.

10)  Book-creation/Portfolio audit:
Develop simple adhoc report to help audit books that are not associated with portfolios.  Discuss validation specifications with Ramesh.

11) Financial checks and balances:  
How can reported position/P&L numbers match up with those reported by accounting?  Need to find out who owns the accounting reporting and see if some adhoc verification can be implemented.


Known RisktRAC requirements beyond Day1

1) Desktop RisktRAC portfolio security 
Review how to implement portfolio-level security in the RisktRAC that is already present on the RAC website.

2) Benchmark Server:
Review with infrastructure how to migrate a copy of the Benchmark Server to a Netco server. 
Debbie and Ramesh to discuss further.

Hi Stacey,
The raw data is in M:\power2\region, but the files that I actually collect the data from and that are e-mailed to me, are located in the directory I requested access to (M:\common\power\position\dpr\2001\westpos\2001\).

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

What information are you trying to obtain through m:\common\power?  Sorry for all the questions, but everyone requesting this directory gets them as this directory contains extremely sensitive information.

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

Chris, I am unable to publish the VaR report for the West. It is telling me it is a read only document.

John/Kam and Donnie/Casey,

Attached is the proposed hierarchy for Day 1 of testing (Wednesday afternoon as I understand) - see "VaR Hierarchy" tab in the spreadsheet. Please confirm that my population of books is complete and accurate.

I'm going into a legacy database to pull data and I'm having some problems (ODBC -connection to "rmsprod" failed.).  The name of the database is ~ORMSDBS97A.  This database was owned by an employee that is no longer with Enron.  Problem is that Jeff Gossett's team, Kathy Reeve's team, John Postlethwaite's team, Stacey White's team and Global ops used this database to query for daily reporting regarding traders VAR.  Either we need front end that can save query out for front end or we need a similar database for NETCO.  I'm neutral, however I think a similar database hook up would be quicker than front end solution.

Also, have Jeff and Stacey been able to create the benchmark report on test portfolio's?
Frank

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

I believe Wabash has also terminated.
 
Don,
As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
 
I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.

Subject: East Power Meeting



We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts. 

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week. 

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002 
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002 
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002

Postle,

I just did a download from Global Facilities of all the delivery points associated with Mid-C, NP15, SP15 and Rockies.  You might want to get with Kara (or someone else in scheduling) to determine which points are still actively used.  If you find that you're deleting alot more than you're keeping (as was our case), simply highlight the ones you want to take forward to UBS and send the file to Kim Theriot.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey

1.  Lloyd can trade any region with 30 day limit and total position limit of 100 MW.    Lloyd will do mostly spread trades.
2.  Per our earlier discussion
3.  Ontario is part of the NE and we plan on having an Ontario market maker.   I have to sort this out with Milly.   Please stay silent on this one until we get the deal closed.

Subject:	additional UBS trading questions

Kevin,

A few questions on UBS trading:

1.  What region will Lloyd Will be trading?

2.  Who should we set up power futures books for?!  (you, Fletch, Dana and Rob?)

3.  Regarding the Ontario curve, Stacey has held discussions with individuals in the Calgary office and it has been decided that Ontario trading will now fall under the realm of the Calgary office, not East.  As a result, East will not have "ownership" of the Ontario curve.  Is this your understanding?!

Last, I am attaching the original book list we had compiled for UBS before offers were declined, and I have highlighted in yellow the traders/books which are no longer going to the new company.  Could you please let me know if there will be someone else assigned to these books?!  Also, please point out any other modifications which you would like me to make regarding desk structure.   

Thanks!
Casey

Which U.S. city is the focus of Groundhog Day observance?
Visit Punxsutawney, PA in our Geographical Dictionary.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/peoplace/geog.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 7 is:

prototype   \PROH-tuh-type\   (noun)
     1 : an original model on which something is patterned
: archetype
     2 : an individual that exhibits the essential features of
a later type
    *3 : a first full-scale and usually functional form of a
new type or design of a construction (as an airplane)

Example sentence:
     The engineers have promised to have the prototype of the
new sedan finished by March.

Did you know?
     The prefix "prot-," or "proto-," comes from Greek and has
the basic meaning "first in time" or "first formed." A
"prototype" is someone or something that serves as a model or
inspiration for those that come later. A successful fund-raising
campaign can serve as a prototype for future campaigns. The
legendary Robin Hood, the "prototypical" kindhearted and honorable
outlaw, has been the inspiration for countless other romantic
heroes. And for over a century, Vincent van Gogh has been the
prototype of the brilliant, tortured artist who is unappreciated
in his own time.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Hi Christy, 

Attached is the most recent version of the Power Trading CSA.  

 
This is pretty much the definitive version, and contains the key controls.  However it is in the process of being "Andersenised" to reflect their methodology - when this has been completed (31st October) I will forward a copy for your records.

Attached is a list of deals.  Per Ed Sacks, the NIMO deals should be terminated.  I have not received a recent list of terminations since I returned so I'm sending this individually.
 
Thanks.  My holidays were quiet and restful.  Hope yours were great.

I have documentation showing that Select Energy Acquired Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing through a stock purchase agreement effective 11/30/01 and that they terminated Niagara's Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 6/23/97 effective 12/2/01.  I do not show that Select canceled their agreement with EPMI, and there are outstanding physical deals with them.  I will let you know as soon as I find out from Ed Sacks in credit if we should terminate the NIMO deals where they stand or move them to Select and then terminate.

Kim,
Attached is a list which has some counterparties that were previously on the Master List, but have now been identified as "yes" for termination.  I thought I would send you this list so you could easily tell the ones that have changed on the master list.

Subject:	RE: Testing Request

Hi Sam:

  I owed you the answer to this question for too long.  Let me make it up.

  First of all, Hypothetic curve shift is defined as the difference of Mark-to-Market value between current price curve and current price curve perturbed by specified amount ($1, $2, $3, $4, $10) for peak hours.  Note that the off-peak hour curve stays unchanged, but that doesn't mean you can ignore the off-peak part of the deal, since it will have impact on the overall average price.

  I think it easier to go through an example to show the point.  Please see post id 15936 I set up, in which we will examine a forward deal 896746 for the day 1/18/2002. 

  The deal is for 24 hours and 25MW/hour.  From the spreadsheet below, you can see how the original daily price is $21.33, after $1 shift to the peak hour price, the new daily price is $22,  the discount Vol for the day is -598.9833, hence the final hypothetic curve shift is -598.9833 * (22-21.3333),   or -399.  Same logic to get the hypothetic curve shift for $2, $3, etc.

   

  It follows the same logic for option deals, although the result will not be linear like for swap.  There seem to be a unwanted feature in current executable which combined the hypothetic curve shift for different shift into the $1 bucket, we will fix that in future release, but if you want the "right" executable now, you can find it at /home/zyang/pwrcalc_hcs.

  Please let me know if you have further questions.

- Zhiyun

Hey Zhiyun,

Since I don't have much going on here, I am afraid I need to keep bugging you on this :p. Anyway, I have picked a region that has bigger HCS numbers so that we can notice the difference easier - LTSW R7. I have attached my results for your reference.

>From what I see is, if I am using the right report (Swap Details), and if my formula is right, then the number I got to verify the accuracy of the HCS report is quite different from the actual result.

For example, I took 11/01 and 12/01 to calculate the HSC number using the formula I thought is right. Assuming the HCS is only based on Peak curves and strips:
                              HCS # calculated                HCS report
11/01@$1.00             $47,893                             ($1,413,407)
11/01@$2.00             $95,758                             ($1,424,161)
12/01@$1.00             $26,701                             ($1,428,808)
12/01@$2.00             $53,378                             ($1,278,636)                                      

Again, if you could take a look when you have the time to take a breathe, that would be great!!

Thanks,
Sam

Hi Zhiyun,

I have just run a calc again for LT-Cali. I have attached the HCS report and the Swap Detail for R7 for your reference. Based on what you said, should I expect there is HCS figures for 11/01 since I have quite a large MTM value for deals flow during 11/01 (as in Swap Details)? Could you please find out why I don't see any numbers in the HCS report for 11/01?

Or am I missing something?

Thanks!

Hi Sam:

  Norman was caught up with too many projects recently, let me try to chip in a little.

  What the HCS report has is the what if results, that is, how much P&L change we will see should PEAK HOUR price moves up $1, $2 etc.  For example, if your current day MtM is $50,000, if peak price goes up by $1, your MtM will be say 70,000, then the $20,000 difference will be reported in the HCS report.

  Hope this help you get started.  I guess HCS report has not been reviewed for quite a while, but I think at least the swap part should still be fine.  Please let us know if you notice anything wrong.

Hi Norman and Zhiyun,

As I have bugged you both a little bit about this already, I hope you won't mind helping me even a bit more!! :p Anyway, I ran an unofficial calc earlier today on LT-NW (Post ID: 13923) with the Hypothetical Curve Shift on. It generated the attached HCS report.

My question is, can you give me the formula the PortCalc used to calculate those HCS columns, especially for Swap_HCS? I want to get a better idea of how they are calculated first before I can verify the accurancy of them.

Thank you so much!!

Sam

PS: Zhiyun, I haven't run a mini book on a basis option yet. I thought I should start with the more basic first......thanks for your advice though!

There is a report in PortCalc - Hypothetical Curve Shift (Monthly) - that I would like someone to review for accuracy.  It is meant to have price increments that indicate what curve shift would have been had the curve been adjusted by that increment.  In order for this report to be generated, you have to choose the Hypothetical Curve Shift option in PortCalc (see below)

President Bush, Visionary Leader
By Carol Devine-Molin

Since the aftermath of 9/11, President Bush has effectively dispelled
any lingering doubts regarding his ability to lead this great nation,
especially in light of his overall handling of the profound crisis
foisted upon us by the forces of terror. Clearly, Bush's actions on the
national security and war fronts have earned him significant backing
from the American people, as demonstrated by his approval ratings that
have remained in the high 80% bracket. He is well appreciated by the
American people, as is his wartime consiglieri, Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld.

But what sets Bush apart as an outstanding leader? Bush is a visionary,
a man with a remarkable plan that will significantly safeguard the
citizenry over the long haul. He is determined to strategically
orchestrate all that must be done in order to guarantee the safety and
security of the American people, not just for the immediate future, but
for several generations to come. Yes, President Bush and his resolute
team have set out to accomplish a monumental mission, which will
generate tremendous positive impact. Unlike Clinton, who was primarily
focused upon the short-term economy, his own public travails, and
excessive attempts to broker an all but impossible deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians, Bush understands that his primary
responsibility as president is to protect the American people, both at
home and abroad, plain and simple.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Two thousand and one has been a year that
Americans will always remember. We suffered great loss, and we found a
new unity. We were attacked, and we responded swiftly. We have seen the
strength of America in countless acts of kindness, compassion and
courage.

This year ends with progress on the battlefield and accomplishment at
home. The men and women of our military have successfully fought a new
kind of war. They applied new tactics and new technology to rout a new
kind of enemy. The lessons we learn in Afghanistan will guide our
military to the future, and make our country stronger and more secure.

On the home front, we're strengthening our defenses against terrorist
attack, while upholding our constitutional liberties. Our airways are
more secure, and we are standing on alert.

Teaching the Essentials
By Alan Keyes

According to the Washington Post, "The start of the war on terrorism
proved an unexpected tonic for education reform." The Post cites a White
House aide who said, "I think [congressional education negotiators] saw
it as a way they could demonstrate to the country that Congress had not
been immobilized." Apparently, the nation lives in fear that terrorists
will intimidate the people's representatives away from the now rapidly
resuming task of federal over-reaching executed in the name of reform.
Take heart, oh people! Our politicians will not be dissuaded from
expanding state power at the expense of liberty.

There are those, of course, who would rank a "mobilized Congress" high
on the list of terrorizing sights. Heaven help us when Ted Kennedy
partners with "compassionate conservatives" in issuing marching orders
for the education bureaucracy to "leave no child behind." War tends to
increase national governmental power -- not only in matters directly
related to the conflict, but also in vastly broader realms of our common
life. In a season of national pride and solidarity, advocates of
expanded government power tend to find rich fields offering "targets of
opportunity." Education is such a field, and in the legislation passed
last week, it has received a direct hit.

Beneath the News Lies the Real Problems
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Bombs on airplanes make sensational headlines.  The tanking economy
doesn't.  And that's exactly how we're going to enter the year 2002.
We'll be reading about isolated acts of terrorism that would probably
dwindle if so much media space weren't given to the whack jobs who try
to pull sensational, destructive acts for their own warped egos.

The plight of a million or so Americans who lost their jobs this past
year (and figures vary as to the exact number) isn't good news for
America or for the world.  It's the news in small print under the
stories about terrorism and the elusive bin Laden, who probably will
never be found.

Another New Year, Getting Better All The Time!
By SARTRE

The infinite capacity for delusion is the primary result of 'so called'
progress. During this holiday season we are constantly reminded about
good will to men and how nice the world is. We are told that the next
year will be better and that the promise for mankind is bright. Focus is
always directed towards the advancement of society. What sells in this
world of myth and mirage, is a fairy tale for the faint of heart, for
the ending must always lead to happy every after . . .

Ashoka
By Scott Gillette

Every holiday I write a column about charitable organizations with the
vision and capabilities to solve social and economic problems on a
global basis. Last year I wrote about Lifewater International. This year
I am pleased to write about Ashoka.

The events of 9-11 focused charitable giving on the victims and heroes
in the wake of those attacks, and that's the way it should have been. I
considered an organization like the September 11th Fund as being a good
subject for this column, but everyone is aware of that charity's
efforts, while only a few may know about Ashoka. It is important to
acknowledge groups like Ashoka that dedicate themselves to solving
problems on a permanent basis, with little fanfare.

Tom,

The East Peak number looks pretty accurate, but the Off-Peak is WAY off....you have us short (31,458,553) and our records show us short only (8,855,367).  I would recommend that you maybe run your adhoc query again for off-peak.  The difference is so large that I don't know what else it could be other than an error in the query inputs.  Give me a ring if you still come up with the same answer and we'll walk through your query together.

Thanks.
Casey

Frank,
The hierarchies can be created only when the NETCO databases go live. We are very busy with the estate hardware, database and software changes right now. Sometime next week, we will get the NETCO test database setup and you may create this hierarchy there.

Regards,
Ramesh

Kathy,
I'm still working to get authorization to create hierarchy in Risktrac, in the meantime can you create the hierarchies?  I think in NETCO we are going to do away with the Burton McIntyre function and have it reside at risk level, this way it is done correctly.   Ramesh is working to provide a separate Risktrac system for NETCO in which to create the hierarchy.  

Ramesh, would it be ok for now to have the Risk function create a NETCO hierarchy in Risktrac then copy that hierarchy over into NETCO  once the "clean" version was complete?

Subject:	NETCO Portfolio Book Structure

In considering setting up books for NETCO,  RAC needs the following:  (I recognize portfolio name choice may not be optimal)
1.	Ownership of ERMS and Enpower
o	For Canada, it would probably be best if ownership resided in Houston (Peggy, any feedback would be helpful)
2.	Recognizing that portfolio hierarchy may need to be augmented pending buyers request, I recommend three portfolio structures.
o	Trading portfolio (heterogeneous, incl. everything traders trade) - 2 portfolio's (power & gas) aggregated under NETCO total
?	Trader (sub portfolio by risk type) , regional, parent portfolio  (includes all commodities in traders portfolio)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas Trading
?	Financial Desk
?	Arnold
o	Price
o	Basis
o	Exotics
o	Power Trading
?	East Power
?	Presto
o	Long term
o	Short term
o	Commodity portfolio Gas and Power (homogenous)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Gas Power
?	East
?	West
o	Northwest
o	Southwest
?	Gas Gas
?	Financial
?	West 
?	Etc.
o	Power 
?	Power Gas
?	Power Power
o	Curve portfolio grouped regionally - This portfolio does not currently exist.  
?	Starts with curves, regional, root portfolio, parent 
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Northeast
?	Transco Z6
?	etc
o	Power
?	Northeast
?	NEPOOL
?	Etc.

Additionally, we need to correct curve shift reporting in Risktrac as well as bench mark positions.  In the past Canada was "grandfathered" under its legacy transactions, but under NETCO there should not be any legacy deals and as such Canada needs to report its risk the same as we do in Houston.  PortCalc may need to be modified to handle currency issues and other as well as new curves may need to be created.  When creating new curves, please copy in ERMS 90 days worth of price history so that we can measure VAR. 

I apologize if this is vague, please feel free to provide feedback.

Thanks
Frank

Hello everyone!

I hope 2002 is finding all of you healthy and happy.
Angela, the girls, and I are well settled now in Katy,
TX and enjoying our new home.

I am writing all of you because of an event in which I
will be participating next month:  The Houston AIDS
Walk 2002.  I am asking that you assist me in doing
all we can to ensure a future without this tragic
disease.  I (and hopefully the girls) will be walking
3.5 miles on Mar 10 representing everyone who chooses
to sponsor me (this is where you all come in).

After having my own children, I have become much more
aware of and sensitive to causes that I believe can
positively impact the lives of children not as
fortunate as mine.  The tragedy of this disease and
the impact it has on children has motivated me to
reach out to all of you in my efforts to do my part
for this cause.

In addition to the $100 I plan to donate, I hope to
raise $1000 for this event.  If I can get just 40
people to donate $25 each I will have met this goal.
The proceeds from the walk will benefit the AIDS
Foundation Houston and its partner agencies.  Any
amount you can donate would be greatly appreciated.
If you are unable to pledge at this time, please join
me in learning more about this horrible epidemic.  The
more we all know about it, the better we can help
eliminate it.

You can pledge by simply replying to this email with
the amount you intend to donate.  I will then contact
all that have pledged individually to determine
payment options/timing.

Thank you some much for your time.

Best Regards,
Brad McDonald

That's fine....as long as we can pull the info on the desk level.  Also, we will need to move this report to the Report Launcher within Enpower (i.e. get it out of the Port Calc screen) because we will need to grant access to it to individuals in Accounting and we don't want to give them access to Port Calc.  Ideally, we would like to have a screen similar to other reports in the report launcher (i.e. pcs) that would allow us to choose a portfolio, then choose certain or all desks within that portfolio, then choose whether we would like the info on a summary level (i.e. total liabilities and total assets) or a detail level (i.e. liabilities and assets on an individual deal basis within the desk selected).  Make sense?!

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll call and check messages so if this is unclear, you can just leave me a voice mail.  Otherwise, I'll be back in the office on Thursday.

Thanks!

Dear Casey,

	In order to run MTM Detail report by Desk, a Post ID is still needed. Is that acceptable? You will first choose a Post ID, and then select the desks within that Post ID.

	Would you want multiple Post IDs at once, too?

	Thanks,


Norman.

The Word of the Day for October 30 is:

virtuoso   \ver-choo-OH-so or ver-choo-OH-zoh\   (noun)
     1 : one skilled in or having a taste for the fine arts
     2 : one who excels in the technique of an art; especially
: a highly skilled musical performer (as on the violin)
    *3 : a person who has great skill at some endeavor

Example sentence:
     Agatha Christie fans love her Belgian sleuth, Hercule
Poirot, a virtuoso whose "little gray cells" never fail to
unravel the most difficult murder cases.

Did you know?
     English speakers borrowed the Italian noun "virtuoso" in
the 1600s. It comes in turn from the Italian adjective
"virtuoso," which means both "virtuous" and "skilled." In
English, "virtuoso" can be pluralized as either "virtuosos" or
"virtuosi," and it is often used attributively ("a virtuoso
performer"). The first virtuosos were men of substantial
knowledge and learning ("great wits," to quote one 17th
century clergyman). The word was then transferred to those
skilled in the arts, and by the 18th century it had acquired
its specific sense applied to musicians. In the 20th century,
English speakers broadened "virtuoso" again to apply to a
person skilled in any pursuit.

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

The Word of the Day for December 31 is:

syllabub   \SIH-luh-bub\    (noun)
     1 : a drink made by curdling milk or cream with an acid
beverage (as wine or cider)
     *2 : a sweetened drink or topping made of milk or cream
beaten with wine or liquor and sometimes further thickened with
gelatin and served as a dessert

Example sentence:
      "There will be Champagne and wine for the adults as well
as eggnog [and] syllabub, a frothy cream and wine concoction."
(Marian Burros, _Chicago Tribune_, December 23, 1993)

Did you know?
     Syllabub's a concoction whose name once had almost as many
variations as there are versions of how to make it -- "solybubbe,"
"sullabub," "sullibib," "sellibub," "sallibube," "sillie bube,"
"sillybob," even "sillibuck" and "sillybauk." Unfortunately, no
one's figured out where the name came from (there's no connection
to "silly," as far as we know, though imbibing it might make one
act that way). Both the name "syllabub" and the concoction itself
go back to at least the 16th century. Today, we're more likely to
encounter "syllabub" in a historical novel than on the menu at a
local drinking spot, but the drink/dessert does get made
occasionally -- and those fortunate enough to taste it often give
it rave reviews.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

I take it that East and West will continue to mark the curves differently in the future then?  As you know, portcalc is portfolio based when deal with business logic, to incorporate region dependent logic into portcalc will require structure changes.  It will be best if all desks can mark the curves the same way.  If that is not going to happen,  we'll make the changes to do the right thing, but I'm afraid it won't happen over night.

Two other questions:
For transmission deals, is the logic right to use daily volt for current month and blend volt for future month for the West portfolio?  That's the same logic for all daily options in the West portfolio right now.

Is the logic still valid that monthly volt should be used when expiration date is explicitly specified?

Thanks,

- Zhiyun

Dr Yang,

The RETAIL EAST portfolio needs to use the same methodology  as the EAST portfolio and the RETAIL WEST portfolio needs to use the same methodology as the WEST portfolio.  I believe that how Stacey wants the vols calculated is as follows.  If a deal that uses volatility in its calculation is at a region in the EAST it should use the daily or monthly vols respectively.  If a deal is at a west Region, than it should use the blending methodologies used in the WEST portfolio.  This will allow deals between the EAST and WEST portfolio to use the correct vols if such a deal were entered.  The transmission deals may not explicitly state a time horizon for exercise, but the nature of the deal allows you to make your decision on use of the transmission on a daily basis therefore,  I believe transmission deals should always use the daily volatilities.

Subject:	option volatilities used in portcalc

Dear All:

  Here is a summary of how volatility curves are used in portcalc option evaluation:

Rule:

1.  IF it is monthly option OR if the expiration date is explicitly specified in the deal entry,
     Then use monthly volatility 

2.  IF it is one of the following portfolios: EAST, ENAWEATHER, SIMTRADE, ENACCO, PLANT, SVCE AND
         it is one of the following instrument type: Option, Spread Option, Basis Option, Index Option
    Then
         use daily volatility for daily option, use monthly curve for monthly option

   Otherwise
      If it is current month,  use daily volatility
      Otherwise use blend volatility of monthly and daily(intra-month) curves.

3. For Asian strips, basket volatility is used based on monthly weekday and weekend volatility curves.

I'd like to point out that as a result of the above rules, 

1. for transmission deals, which does not explicitly specify expiration frequency or expiration date, for both East and West portfolios, daily volatility curve is used for current month, blend volatility is used for forward months.

2. Retail East and Retail West behave the same as West portfolio.

Please let us know if you need further clarification on how volatility curves are used in portcalc and advice us if any changes should be made.

Thank you very much,

- Zhiyun

Dear all,

Your PCs setting for Excel applications is ready for  UBS. This afternoon I have run some tests on J.P and Andrea PCs. It look fine.  I also copy some pure library file back to the system. However, I have not worked on any other file. 

Please let me when the  files can be worked.

For DprAutomation with "J9". I make two versions.  One is for Estate, (since the environment in UBS are not ready for "J9", then we have to test on Estate). You may have to login as Estate to test it. Another is  for UBS. Both of versions are at M:\Power_devl\Test\Swap Liq\.

J.P.,

I have to run for my last bus and am not able to run test and give you answer for your concern about Gas Shift question in new DprAutomation today. I will give you an answer tomorrow.

Thank you!

Min Zheng

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

J.P.

Hi girls!  Just wanted everyone to check their
calendars for some upcoming events.  Madeline's
baptism is going to be Saturday, April 6th during the
5:30pm mass.  We plan on having a little celebration
at our house afterwards.  If you can't make it, we
understand, but we'd love to have you come.

We talked about doing Stacey's baby shower the next
weekend, April 13 at Kathy's house.  Does that date
still work for everyone?  Let us know soon so we can
start making plans.

Talk to you soon.
Angela

P.S. for Chris - If you think you can come for one of
the weekends, you should choose Stacey's shower - it
won't hurt my feelings!  :)

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!

Dear Everyone:

  As some of you might have heard, I gave my one-week notification last Friday, my last day with Enron will be Thursday, 1/31.  The reason of my leaving is purely visa status, I have nothing but joy working with you all in the last one and half years,  the wonderful experience made the departure a painful decision.

  I shall be around in the next few days should you need anything from me.  I'd like to thank you all for making my work at Enron such a thrill experience, for your support and friendship, I hope I will have a chance and honor to work with you again in the future.

  Good luck to all of us!

- Zhiyun

Stacey,

Harlan Murphy informed me that City of Redding has not terminated.  I asked him to have Stephanie Panus take it off of the master list as a "Y".  I called Steve Hall and Steve had Harlan call me with the answer to City of Redding.

Let me know if you need me to help with anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa

I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet.  This is just an update of my initial review.  Any comments would be appreciated.  I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today.  After tomorrow's updates, I will do these.  We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow.  If anyone has a problem with the counterparties identified, please let me know as soon as possible

Thanks,

The Word of the Day for December 23 is:

ineluctable   \ih-nih-LUK-tuh-bul\   (adjective)
     : not to be avoided, changed, or resisted : inevitable

Example sentence:
     In classical Greek tragedy, the hero's flaw leads him to a
disastrous and ineluctable fate.

Did you know?
     Like drama, wrestling was popular in ancient Greece and
Rome. "Wrestler," in Latin, is "luctator," and "to wrestle" is
"luctari." "Luctari" also has extended senses -- "to struggle,"
"to strive," or "to contend." "Eluctari" joined "e-" ("ex-")
with "luctari," forming a verb meaning "to struggle clear of."
"Ineluctabilis" brought in the negative prefix "in-" to form an
adjective describing that which cannot be escaped or avoided.
English speakers borrowed the word as "ineluctable" around 1623.
Another word that has its roots in "luctari" is "reluctant."
"Reluctari" means "to struggle against" -- hence someone who is
"reluctant" resists or holds back.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on
December 24, 25, or 26.  The full text for each day's word will
be available at: http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Israel Estrada should be on a list to retain, but his badge and IT access was cut off last Friday.  He apparently still did not have access today, but is out of the office.

Can you please verify you have him on a retain list, make sure he did not get a term packet and $4,500 and also get his access reinstated.  thanks

Stacey and Peggy,  could you help me in obtaining Tim's signature on the attached authorized trader list.  We need to get specific information on those individuals that are authorized to trade with brokers.  We have received some recent requests for the updated list from brokers.  Can you look over the list and let me know if there are any changes and if you can identify those individuals as well as the brokers (by firm name) that they are authorized to trade with?  Any assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated.  Please call me with any questions at ext. 31939.  Thanks. Donna Lowry

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Everyone,

As we prepare to re-launch the website, we're planning a simulation session for our traders and originators for next week (tentatively Monday).  This session will be similar to the ones we had before the initial launch of EnronOnline.  In brief, the goals are:

Test the integrity/functionality of the system and related processes,
Get everyone re-acclimated with the system and processes (traders, originators, credit, operations, help desk, et al), and
Show how the trading system and our processes work to the UBS staff visiting next week.

In order for the simulation to be successful, we will need to ensure that the simulation environment is exactly like the "live" trading environment.  We will need to coordinate with each one of you about what needs to get done to make this possible.  I will be sending out an invite for a meeting tomorrow morning.  Please make sure you attend to discuss what needs to get done on your end (setting up trader/counterparty profiles, credit headroom, etc.), as this simulation has been requested for early next week.  If you have prior commitments, please appoint someone from your group to fill in for you.

Feel free to call me with any questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Dear Casey, Donnie,

	We have made some final changes to the Financial curves UNIX file generation, and finished the testings for today.  

	The curves for region Into AEP ( R2A), basis point Ameren (B10), Michigan ( B12) and Illinois ( B37) have some differences between the Excel files and the New Curve Manager due to data-entry. Apart from that, the tests went well with no other problems.

	We are ready for Production on Monday, and Arun, Siva and Anand will help the traders like the last rollout. 

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

***************************************************************
Bring the gift of language and laughter home for the holidays
with The Merriam-Webster and Garfield Dictionary.
http://www.m-w.com/book/diction/garfield.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 15 is:

gibe   \JYBE\   (verb)
    *1 : to utter taunting words
     2 : to deride or tease with taunting words

Example sentence:
     When the crowd began to hoot and gibe at him, Chris decided
to cut his speech short.

Did you know?
     Confused about "jibe" and "gibe"? The distinction actually
isn't as clear-cut as some commentators would like it to be.
"Jibe" is used both for the verb meaning "to be in accord, agree"
("jibe with") and for the verb and noun of nautical parlance
("jibe the mainsail," "a risky jibe in heavy seas"). "Gibe" is
used for the verb "to deride or tease" and the noun "a taunting
remark." But "jibe" is a recognized variant of "gibe," so it,
too, has taunting or teasing uses. "Gibe" has been used
occasionally as a variant of "jibe," but this use is very rare,
and many would consider it to be an error.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

The Word of the Day for December 29 is:

forfend   \for-FEND\   (verb)
    *1 : to ward off : prevent
     2 : protect : preserve

Example sentence:
     My roommate claims the best way to forfend a nasty cold is
to chew garlic.

Did you know?
     "You certainly won't find me running a marathon, paddling
the Volga, or, heaven forfend, singing opera," wrote _Boston
Globe_ staff writer Scot Lehigh in the February 25, 2001 edition
of that paper, using an old meaning of "forfend" in the process.
English speakers have been using "forfend" with the meanings "to
forbid" or "to prevent" since the late 14th century, but these
days we only use the "forbid" sense when we use it, as Lehigh
did, in the phrase "heaven forfend." "Forfend" comes from "for-"
(an old prefix meaning "so as to involve prohibition, exclusion,
omission, failure, neglect, or refusal") and Middle English
"fenden" (a shorter variant of "defenden," meaning "to defend").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

Thanks

Good Afternoon Power Users,

This weekend, January 12 - 13, the split of NEWCO & Enron Estate will actually begin.  Specifically, this weekend, we will be moving the estate applications & databases off of their current hardware and onto other available UNIX & NT servers.  This effort will free-up the existing hardware for NEWCO.  This week, we need help from our key users to ensure these changes will not adversely affect the Enron Estate applications by testing the applications on the new hardware.  

Below are instructions on how to begin testing:

Stage Testing
Starting Thursday morning, January 10th, the Enron Estate test environment will be setup for user testing.  This test environment is actually a rename of the old "PWRTESTN" environment.  To access the Enron Estate Test environment, please choose "Enpower Estate (pwrtestn)".  The short-cut can be found at:

Start ==> Program ==> Development Applications ==> Stage Environment ==> Enpower ==> Enpower Estate (pwrtestn)

Production Testing
Then, on Sunday morning, January 13th, by 8:00AM CST***, the production Enron Estate environment will be ready for user testing.  To access the Enron Estate Production environment, please choose "Enpower Estate Login".  The short-cut can be found at:

Start ==> Program ==> Business Applications ==>Enpower ==> Enpower Estate Login


Thanks,  David Poston
# 713-345-7834

*** Please Note:  This time is still tentative until we have finalized our outage period with the users and the DBA's.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

I went to Dr. Goffman and would definitely recommend him.  As you remember, my eyes took longer to settle than most people, but after a few weeks my vision was 20/20.  Clark and Killian also used him and their eyes were perfect right away.  He's a nice guy and is great about follow-up.  I paid $2500 total, but his costs sometimes fluctuate depending on the cost of the laser center they use.  I'd call him now to schedule a consultation before you create a spending account.  There's always a chance your cornea isn't thick enough for the surgery.  The offices are located off the Katy freeway close to Voss.  Mention me as a reference!  He gives out eyeglass vouchers.  I can always use more shades here in sunny London.  Looking forward to seeing you this weekend.  Jenny.

*We decided to name the new puppy Spike.  I can't wait to see him over Christmas!  On Sunday I saw a woman walking five tiny yorkies and carrying another.  It looked like a parody of the Budweiser Clydesdales.  Very cute.

Who was your surgeon for lasik surgery?  Would you recommend?  I am planning on getting surgery next year and have to make my benefit elections to cover.

I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

Subject:	Curves and Correlations

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be "locked in" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

So far I have talked to everyone but Heather. As I mentioned Nick was much =
better than I anticipated. He said things were a little slower than he was =
expecting but nothing else. The point I wanted to get across to him was to =
take the initiative in working with Jeff and getting more involved within o=
ur group.

Fran was a little unusual. She was concerned about having to wait each morn=
ing before running liquidations because we are not flat and she felt that i=
t was a bad reflection on the group if we reported late. She was also conce=
rned about the Enpower QandA meeting and why none of the West issues had be=
en taken care of that have been sitting there for a couple of months. She a=
lso couldn't understand why it mentioning your name before they would take =
the index option out of the PCS. She just wished that if Bill Crooks requir=
ed your approval then he should say so. Finally, while she has seen some im=
provement with Heather, she is still a little unhappy with her. She feels t=
hat Heather is not doing her part in helping with the day to day routines e=
nough, disappears for a while,etc. I told her that I would talk to Bill abo=
ut the status of our projects, that we need to run liquidations by 9 each m=
orning no matter what and I will address the issue with Bill Williams and T=
im only if necessary. Heather's issues I was going to address anyway, so we=
 will see how that goes. I did tell Fran that she has really stepped up and=
 become a "lead" in this group and that she is doing an outstanding job. I =
also mentioned to her that I talked to you about the work status thing and =
she was very grateful for that. I asked what her long term goals were and s=
he thought at some point about getting into structuring and maybe doing tha=
t in Houston! I was surprised by that comment.


Sam's went fairly well. Her only concern was regarding team spirit. Not wha=
t I thought it meant thought. She really means interaction between people, =
so I have suggested that we go more regular meeting depending on what proje=
cts are going on within the group. She also is comparing herself to Fran an=
d the learning curve. She wanted to know how she could learn more like what=

Will,

I am attaching a list of the deals (both physical and financial) which simply need a desk name change to East or West Bankrupt, whichever is relevant.  My list details the deal #, counterparty full name and the termination date.  Let me know if this makes sense, and as always, thank you so much for your help!

Casey

       You know you're from Texas if:
1.  You measure distance in hours.
2.  You've ever had to switch from "heat to "a/c" in the same day.
3.  Stores don't have bags; they have sacks.
4.  Stores don't have shopping carts: they have buggies.
5.  You see a car running in the parking lot at the store with no one in it, no matter   what time of the year.
6.  You use "fix" as a verb. Example: "It's fixin to rain".
7.  All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, grain or animal.
8. You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked.
9. You carry jumper cables in your car - for your OWN car.
10. You know what "cow tipping" and "snipe hunting" are.
11. You only own four spices: salt, pepper, ketchup and Tabasco.
12. You think everyone from a bigger city has an accent.
13. You think sexy lingerie is a tee shirt and boxer shorts. -- OH YEAH!!   :-)
14. The local paper covers national and international news on one page but requires 6 pages for sports.
15. You think that the first day of deer season is a national holiday.
16. You know which leaves make good toilet paper.
17. You find 90 degrees F "a little warm".
18. You know all four seasons: Almost summer, Summer, Still summer, and Christmas.
19. You know whether another Texan is from southern, middle or northern Texas as soon as they open their mouth.
20. There is a Dairy Queen in every town with a population of 1000 or more.
21. Going to Wal Mart is a favorite past time known a "goin' Wal Martin" or off to "Wally World".
22. You describe the first cool snap (below 70) as "good chili weather".
23. A Carbonated soft drink isn't a soda, cola or pop - it's a Coke, regardless of brand or flavor.
24. You understand these jokes and forward them to your friends from Texas.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 29 is:

petulant   \PEH-chuh-lunt\   (adjective)
     1 : insolent or rude in speech or behavior
    *2 : characterized by temporary or capricious ill humor
: peevish

Example sentence:
     "'What is it all about?' cried Dorian in his petulant way,
flinging himself down on the sofa." (Oscar Wilde, _The Picture
of Dorian Gray_)

Did you know?
     "Petulant" is one among many English words akin to or
derived from the Latin verb "petere," which means "to go to,"
"to attack," "to seek," or "to request." "Petere" is a relative
of the Latin adjective "petulans, petulantis" ("impudent"), from
which "petulant" was derived. Some other words that are related
to "petere" are "compete" and "appetite." "Competere," the Latin
precursor to "compete," is a joining of the prefix "com-" with
the verb "petere." The joining of "ad-" and "petere" led to
"appetere" ("to strive after"), and eventually to "appetitus,"
the source of our "appetite."  Additional descendants of "petere"
are "petition," "perpetual," and "impetus."

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

It should not be difficult to implement 10 days VaR whichever method we will use.  But currently we can not do anything until database and hardware are separated for NetCo and Estate.  After that we can start the implementation.

Regards,

Winston

I agree.  It should be simulation and NOT sqrt(10).  When I said 10 is OK, I was referring to delta-gamma.  Naveen

I'm not in love with square root of 10, I prefer a simulation.  If the best idea is the square root multiplication, please let it be so.  I suggest using the up 99 field to saved the result in.  This way we can start tracking it in database.
Thanks,
Frank

All, The majority of instruments are swaps so that should not be a problem.  Delta-Gamma is a problem mainly for OTM options.
10-days is OK and standard for Delta-Gamma.  It is problematic for times greater than a month or more.

Everyone,

If we do 10 days VaR, then people may challenge our delta-gamma methodology.  With the high volatility of energy market and the long time horizon, delta-gamma method may not be appropriate anymore.

As I said before, if we don't have too many option deals, just multiply square root of 10 (for 10-days VaR) to one day VaR.  If we do have lot option deals, then our current delta-gamma approach may not be good either.

Regards,

Winston

NETCO, if partnered with an ibank will require VaR over a ten day holding period so this is a change we would need to make anyway

Frank,
We are going through a very difficult task of splitting hardware, software,licenses across NETCO and estate. There are massive database transitions in progress and testing scheduled on the new environments on both sides. Database or program changes at this point are very difficult.

If Nilay can come up with the changes and the impact on existing programs, we can see how we can fit these in. But right now our priorities are to cleanup data for NETCO, carry out testing for such a condition and make sure all systems function appropriately on Estate.

Regards,
Ramesh

It appears that we may start developing a pattern of assuring that our positions/curves are correct to the best of knowledge/ability, either  weekly or twice monthly.  This being the case (Jeff and Stacey, please let me if weekly is a correct statement, say Friday?) we will need to enhance our daily VAR calculations with a longer holding period reflecting our "best calc" time frame.  

In English, this means that we need to start measuring VAR for a 5 day or 10 day holding period, pending Jeff and Stacey feedback.  What Risktrac needs to do regarding this business practice is report VAR for the longer holding period.  Due to the portfolio having gamma exposures, we cannot simply multiply everything by the square-root of time.  I suggest that in the RiskTrac system, we offer another box, in addition to the historical VAR box, a box for longer tenor.  I recognize this requires some alterations, but with scaled back business perhaps it won't be extremely difficult.

Additionally, this doesn't mean that we stop the daily/nightly functions we've been doing since the dawn of time, but it does mean that once a week we have a very high confidence that our books reflect our "reality" the way we understand it.

Bad idea? Feedback?

Thanks,
Frank

Casey,
 
Please provide us with the trader names who will be managing the locations on the bottom of this email.  Once we receive this information, we will be applying the names and testing the products.  If there are more than one trader per location due to the term of the trade, please let us know what that breakout will be.  Thank you.

As you finalize the personnel issues, any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful.  The reason for this is because we must apply the trader to the appropriate product(s) in order to test the system completely.  Using the information you provide, we will be able to make sure the traders are set up correctly prior to our go-live date.

Kevin, 

Please identify which trader will be managing the locations you have listed below so we can have the system fully tested as soon as possible.  I understand that we will be using peak and off-peak only for the locations below.  We will work with the trader of the Ontario location and Leslie Hansen to develop this location, as we do not have anything in the system for this yet.  Thanks, in advance, for your response.

I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary=
 focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enoug=
h on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to s=
pend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and acc=
urate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also bee=
n a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily =
routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day t=
o day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that=
 Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead =
of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling =
everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business r=
elated issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of respo=
nsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That w=
ay nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went w=
ell otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitte=
d to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the gro=
up. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accoun=
ting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month an=
d secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the re=
ports that we produce are used.

Hi Stacey:

Several weeks ago Amy Fitzpatrick contacted me about if/how we could coach
John.  By now you have obviously heard about our response.  This morning
John called me and said he was ready to get started.

What I need from you is your 'ok' (via e-mail is fine) to do this.

We would continue to bill you (your cost center) as we have been doing for
your other folks we are coaching.

Please call me or send me a note at your earliest convenience.  John and I
have a telephone session scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.

Also, I'd like a summary from you of what outcomes you want the coaching to
produce.

Take care, enjoy the beautiful weather

Jill

So I am sure you heard about last Friday and that they told everyone who was
with NEWCO and who wasn't. I talked to Bob and I was surprised that Sam is
part of the new company. Wanted to confirm that with you. I have not talked
to her yet since she was on vacation but was planning to do so today. Let me
know if anything has changed on this front.

How was Xmas?

John

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Subject:	Curves to be migrated 

Kevin Presto has informed me that they will be trading on only a portion of the curves which are currently in the Curve Manager.  As a result, we would like to migrate ONLY the curves that they will be using for UBS trading so as not to take up any unneccessary space.  As a result, attached is a list of the EAST curves that we would like migrated to the new curve manager for UBS trading. 

John P. - Please provide the guys with a similar list for the West.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Casey

John, so far, we have been able to get 1998 back for you, it is located at \\nahou-dv16\dpr98, you can either click this link or go to Start, Run and type in the link.

We are working on getting 1999, the files were archived on another server which has been decommissioned, we have the files on tape which we will have to retrieve the data from.

I will let keep you informed of our progress.


Thank You

Marisa, Rafael, and Darryl,

Based on Darryl and my discussions with Rafael earlier this week, the accounting treatment for Modesto Maranzana plant and the associated gas and power contracts will be changed from MTM to accrual effective with December accounting.  

Changes
PPA Amortization and Depreciation  -  Marisa
We need to adjust the PPA amortization and depreciation ytd balances.
PPA amortization - the actual amount of the purchase price allocated to the contracts was different from the $2,220,219 used in the MTM model.  
Depreciation - I know the salvage value in the model $10,000,000 USD after 5 years is different and I think you were using a longer useful life.
Marisa, please calculate the impact of these changes and let Rafael, Darryl, and myself know.

MTM Reversal  -  Martha & Darryl
The net impact of reversal the MTM will be a gain of approximately $978,000.  This is the reversal of the forward value recorded for the PPA's and plant as of November 30, 2001.  Effective today, I will stop including the positions in the feeds to RistRAC.  

Interest  -  Martha
Still waiting to see if we reserve the historial amounts.  The impact on 0502 books is zero as the expense and revenue was booked to the same account just different profit / cost centers.  The income was booked to Modesto Capital Charge 27244 / 150407 which was supposed to roll up to the Office of the Chair for Lavo.  Left Georgeanne Hodges a message on the subject.  

If you think of any I forgot to mention, please let us know.

Martha

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Dear All,

	There is a new PortCalc PRODFIX ( v4.2.2.1 ) which can handle the Bankruptcy Portfolios, please use that one instead. ( The Stage one has some performance problems to be resolved.)

	/prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new

	Sorry for the inconveniences.

	Regards,

Dear Casey, J.P.

The first version of new DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liquidation and other changes is ready for testing. The set of files is saved at 
M:\Power_devl\Test\Swap Liq\

Since the driver and folder are moving around at this moment, all files in that folder must be keeping under same folder.

The formula for Swap Liq is the same as previous agreement.

Also Swap Liq have been rewritten. It is automation row.  It can pull all files from Unix and without manually pulling them via PortCal. The Calculate time for each pair desk/region also has been cut from about 2 minutes down to about 5 seconds. Total time for adding J9 issue is less 5 minutes at this time.

For roll files, I change some tabs names to match their names in Oracle region name. Otherwise, DprAutomation can't work.
 
If you really need the regions names as your new rolls file, I am going to find a way to hard code mapping  them in DprAutomation. However, we think the best way is setup those change in Oracle database. 

All files in that folder are copy files. Any change only affects those copy files.

The tabs names I change in copy rolls are:
R1:  NY Zone G -> NY EAST 
R1A: PJM West -> PJM 
R1C: NY Zone A -> NY WEST
R1D: PJM EASTTERN Hub -> EASTTERN Hub 
R1Z: PJM WESTTERN Hub -> WESTTERN Hub
R3B: TVA -> Into TVA
R4C: Comed -> Into Comed 

I will continue to test, optimize and  polish the Swap Liq and DprAutomation.

Please let us know if there is any correction or any problem.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Casey,

I have finished all big pieces of "J9" and other which are related to DprAutomation. I will put all those pieces together.

Since all of us need to log off of our PCs tonight. I can't work tonight. I will try to make the first version before end of tomorrow.

Also, could you let me know where is your latest roll files location. I need to COPY those files to my PC and have a full test on those COPY files.

BTW, all of our accounts will be switched to UBS.  That change may impact PC and Excel setting. I will be my desk < 8 Am. Let me know if there is anything I can do.

Thank you!

Min Zheng

Weather Alert (WRA Services Corp) is a sub of Enron North America Corp.  For Weather Alert to get money they would have to receive a deposit from company 446, the non dip cash services company.(ENE Adminstrative Services Corp)  The transfer would have to be approved by the cash committee and forecasted.  I left a message for Angie Wingo (last week) to find out what is going on with Weather Alert.  She must be on vacation.  Let me know if you want to try to get the money transferred.  To my knowledge company 446 has money from the Sithe deposits a couple of weeks ago.

Let's talk about Weather Alert on Weds.  It seems that checks sent out pre-petition are being presented to be bank and there are no funds in the account.  Who is the parent of Weather Alert?  Do we know of any reason that we need to honor these checks?

Stacey-

I know that I left you a voice mail on this, but just to keep Kristin in the loop as well.

After our conversation this morning, I talked to Paul Bromley again.  He has asked that you keep in the loop as to your interview schedule so that he may coordinate with his team and Andersen as to attending the interviews.

Again, thanks for doing this for us!  I know that you all are busy.  Thanks,

Christy

It will take some time to figure this out. It seems like we have different lists going around and based on the email below some things may not have been done right.

Andrea:

Thanks for doing that for us.  I also did a check by looking at ad hoc exported after the bankruptcy calc is done.  I believe there might be some deals that were missing in the process of changing the deals and moving them from west portfolio to bankruptcy portfolio.  I will be out starting from 12/17 on vacation.  I will ask John to confirm if there are more changes needed for the cleanup.

Thanks again,
Fran

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

Actually, it would be me.  Mike Mott, our Controller, has not started
considering candidates yet but I'm leading the recruiting effort once he's
ready to go.  Is this person willing to send her resume to me?  I'd gladly
take her call as well.

Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.

Steve, I wanted to send this email in reference to Min Zhen with regards to the fact that he has not been included as one of the employees that will be a part of the new company. I wanted to make you aware of the fact the West and Canada power risk management groups consider Min to be a vital and very important part of the IT support that we receive. His knowledge and understanding of several very important excel macros that we use daily is critical to the success of our groups. It must be noted that on several occasions when other people were asked for help in areas that Min supports, the response was slow as people tried to understand what the problem was and how to fix it. I feel that is very important and necessary that Min be a part of the staff for the new company to ensure that all the risk groups continue to receive the exceptional support that we have come to expect from him.

John

Enron Said To Be Takeover Target, Shell Tipped As Possible Bidder
> Oct. 28 (Power Finance & Risk)
> Enron, which 12 months ago was the darling of the energy markets, has

> Dutch/Shell is one likely bidder, they say, noting that Enron's relatively

> Bechtel hoped, especially in the U.S., and this would be a great fit," he
> continues.
> While many energy concerns would love to get their hands on Enron's hugely

> Another obstacle to any bid is concern that Enron may have additional
> skeletons in its financial closet. Last week's stock market selloff was

Folks-

Kori asked us to kill all the deals between her portfolio and other portfolio due to the bankruptcy.  For this reason, I used Casey's ID (because I did not have access) to access about 20 deals, and I killed these deals.  I have created a spreadsheet with each of these deals listed.

Thanks.

Tom

     Sally/Jeff/Stacey:

     Not sure if you've already seen this-did not see you on the e-mail
     dist list so apologies if duplicative.

     Attached is the document from Gabriel/Wes outlining the split of
     responsibilities per the meeting we had.

     I've taken a quick look and seems OK. He did list cash reconciliations
     as Operations which is correct for the UBSW model, but I don't think
     we've discussed yet who does this or resourcing....I think its done by
     someone in Greg Whiting's group. Vito Sabatelli had sent an e-mail to
     Per on the topic but no update....not sure if you want to take up with
     Wes as well?

     If you have any issues, plse go back to Wes or Gabriel.

     thanks

I thought I would wait until I get a final answer on the trading situation before I send in revisions. It would be easier to do it once rather than several times.

Please take a minute to review the attached update on our activities and assumptions in Wholesale Power Trading and Risk Systems.  As you might expect, most of our focus is on establishing independent NetCo and Estate operating environments.

The second attachment is simply an FYI.  It represents our current systems inventory (apps, hardware, developer software, etc...) for NetCo and Estate.

Glad to discuss...

Steve

Dear Stacey,

	The R21, R22 curves for 2/5 have been copied over. However, there is no 2/6 curves for Estate, so those are not copied. The 2/6 Alberta Post IDs were calculated using Non-Exact curves.

	Will the Estate Alberta curves be marked in the future?

	Thanks,


Norman.

Attached is the file the bankers are using to "reconcile" our backtesting against your pnl's.  Please input into respective columns desk daily pnl.  Hopefully the revised file will put questions to rest.

Attached is the file I'm proposing to send to Chase with suggested wording.  To eliminate "Chase"  from using data to "back-in" to pnl, we deleted all up days, and forwarded out corrected data, per files received from Jeff and Stacey.

Please review and provide feedback.  Additionally, if you are comfortable with data, please authorize its release.

Thanks
Frank


 


"Steve

Following on from our discussion concerning the back testing data, we have re-checked the underlying data with our middle office. There were some errors in your file which we have now corrected, and for clarity, included losses in the backtest file, since these are what we consider in the backtest process. 

I trust this helps - let us know if you need anything further

Regards"

to my knowledge, whenever we set up new gas books we always request all attribute types to be attached  (i.e. gas daily, basis, index, etc...).

Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to Jeff, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  Andrea, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 22 is:

syncretic   \sin-KREH-tik or sing-KREH-tik\   (adjective)
     : characterized or brought about by the combination of
different forms of belief or practice

Example sentence:
     Dr. Portman practices a syncretic form of medicine,
borrowing from both Eastern and Western medical traditions.

Did you know?
     "Syncretic" has its roots in an ancient alliance. It's a
descendant of the Greek word "synkretismos," meaning
"federation of Cretan cities" -- "syn-" means "together, with,"
and "Kret-" means "Cretan." The English word "syncretic"
retains the idea of coalition, and appears in such contexts as
"syncretic religions," "syncretic societies," and even
"syncretic music." "Syncretic" also has a specific application
in linguistics, where it refers to a fusion of grammatical forms.

Please Note: The Word of the Day will not be e-mailed on
December 24, 25, or 26.  The full text for each day's word will

The Word of the Day for January 1 is:

neoteric   \nee-uh-TARE-ik\   (adjective)
     : recent in origin : modern

Example sentence:
     "I find neoteric fiction dreadful as a rule, so I
concentrate my reading on the works of the masters of
yesteryear," declared Anthony.

Did you know?
     An odd thing about "neoteric" is that this word for things
that are modern and new is itself very old. It's been part of
English since at least 1596, and its roots go back even further
-- to ancient Greek. We adapted the word from Late Latin
"neotericus," which also means "recent"; "neotericus" comes from
Greek "neoterikos" and ultimately from "neos," meaning "new" or
"young." As old as its roots are, however, "neoteric" itself
entered English later than its synonyms "modern" (which appeared
earlier in the 16th century) and "newfangled" (which has been
with us since the 14th century).

Kevin Presto has informed me that they will be trading on only a portion of the curves which are currently in the Curve Manager.  As a result, we would like to migrate ONLY the curves that they will be using for UBS trading so as not to take up any unneccessary space.  As a result, attached is a list of the EAST curves that we would like migrated to the new curve manager for UBS trading. 

John P. - Please provide the guys with a similar list for the West.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Casey

Subject:	J9 issue

Hi Casey:

  Sorry we have to go through this J9 question so many times.  I think it will help all of us if we can use an example.  Let's assume we have a swap deal for 3 days: Sep 1, Sep 2, Sep 3, and the fixed price is 0 for simplicity.  Again for simplicity assume the index price for the three days didn't change and stayed as $1.  The only thing changed is the volume.

  On Sep 1 the volume is 12 MWH
  On Sep 2 we backdated the deal for Sep 1 as 10 MWH, and for Sep 2 as 10 MWH
  On Sep 3 we backdated the deal for both Sep 1 and Sep 2 as 15 MWH

  I'm trying to understand what should go into J9 on Sep 2 and Sep 3 respectively.  Can you help me?  In particular, should J9 on Sep 3 reflect the true-up for both Sep 1 and Sep 2?

  The current J9 formula (the wrong one that is) should shown the financial liquidation on Sep 2 as -2 (=10-12), and on Sep 3 as 10(15+15-10-10).  Isn't that correct?

  Thanks a lot!

- Zhiyun

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we can provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at the cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lower level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a further allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later we can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is preliminary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaking it out.

Thanks,

Kevin

Please change the connection in Access to estrmsp_ded from rmsprod_ded or rmsprod.
 
Some of the issues have been addressed in the data grabber part of the web site and in RisktRAC. This effort was started in September and yet to be completed. 
 
It is prefered to have one source of data going out to all, instead of multiple copies of the Access database. We welcome feedback - and reasonable time to incorporate these changes into the web functionality
 
This group did not design the Access database. In fact, I personally have not even seen it. We will be in the midst of NETCO test database setup, NETCO data cleanup, user creations, RisktRAC migration, Web migration and Unix migration to the new hardware next week. If we have the time, we will certainly help in correcting issues related to the Access database.
 
Regards,
Ramesh

I'm going into a legacy database to pull data and I'm having some problems (ODBC -connection to "rmsprod" failed.).  The name of the database is ~ORMSDBS97A.  This database was owned by an employee that is no longer with Enron.  Problem is that Jeff Gossett's team, Kathy Reeve's team, John Postlethwaite's team, Stacey White's team and Global ops used this database to query for daily reporting regarding traders VAR.  Either we need front end that can save query out for front end or we need a similar database for NETCO.  I'm neutral, however I think a similar database hook up would be quicker than front end solution.

Also, have Jeff and Stacey been able to create the benchmark report on test portfolio's?

HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Call David Portz at 3-9239 with questions.

In considering setting up books for NETCO,  RAC needs the following:  (I recognize portfolio name choice may not be optimal)
1.	Ownership of ERMS and Enpower
o	For Canada, it would probably be best if ownership resided in Houston (Peggy, any feedback would be helpful)
2.	Recognizing that portfolio hierarchy may need to be augmented pending buyers request, I recommend three portfolio structures.
o	Trading portfolio (heterogeneous, incl. everything traders trade) - 2 portfolio's (power & gas) aggregated under NETCO total
?	Trader (sub portfolio by risk type) , regional, parent portfolio  (includes all commodities in traders portfolio)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas Trading
?	Financial Desk
?	Arnold
o	Price
o	Basis
o	Exotics
o	Power Trading
?	East Power
?	Presto
o	Long term
o	Short term
o	Commodity portfolio Gas and Power (homogenous)
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Gas Power
?	East
?	West
o	Northwest
o	Southwest
?	Gas Gas
?	Financial
?	West 
?	Etc.
o	Power 
?	Power Gas
?	Power Power
o	Curve portfolio grouped regionally - This portfolio does not currently exist.  
?	Starts with curves, regional, root portfolio, parent 
?	Example
?	NETCO Business Unit
o	Gas
?	Northeast
?	Transco Z6
?	etc
o	Power
?	Northeast
?	NEPOOL
?	Etc.

Additionally, we need to correct curve shift reporting in Risktrac as well as bench mark positions.  In the past Canada was "grandfathered" under its legacy transactions, but under NETCO there should not be any legacy deals and as such Canada needs to report its risk the same as we do in Houston.  PortCalc may need to be modified to handle currency issues and other as well as new curves may need to be created.  When creating new curves, please copy in ERMS 90 days worth of price history so that we can measure VAR. 

I apologize if this is vague, please feel free to provide feedback.

Thanks
Frank

Is there a problem for us to have NETCO in our book names for UBS?!  If so, we can change the "NETCO" to "UBS" through all of the systems, or simply delete "NETCO", whichever would be easier.  However, if it isn't a problem, I suggest we just leave as is to eliminate any problems we may encounter in attempting to have all of the names changed in all of the associated systems?!

Thanks.
Casey

Importance:	High

The Power desks were set up with the identifier as NETCO as part of the name to keep them separate from the old book names. The set up was done originally in the Estate Environ. before the systems were split.  The name can be changed to lose the NETCO ref. if need be.  Hope this clarifies the many email attachments below!

The majority of the book names have the NETCO name in them.  Is this going to change?  Those names were given to us to add as books in our system.  Please advise ASAP in case we need to change in our database applications.

These NETCO references should not have been part of the test.  
After today, the upstream source needs to remove (or rename) to their real name.  NetCo named testing was for last week only.

Wednesday and Thursday testing should not use these desks.

All,

This issue has been resolved. The problem is that there are two desks should include in our counterparty list, however, it's not there
DUNS_LINK_ID		CP_NM					COUNTER_PARTY_CD
166974			NETCO Long Term Managemet		NETCO-LT-MGMT
167023			NETCO Hourly Southeast 		NETCO-HRLY-SE

Global team already fixed it

Andrea,
I'm hearing from David Poston that EOL deals were sent down with old desks (?) that kicked out of EnPower.

David,
Attached is what EOL sent, please verify these loaded.
What data did EOL send down incorrectly?  We need to fix for the Wednesday and Thursday test.

 << File: trans summary 020402 POWER.xls >> 

I'm also hearing from Lori that the deals were not scheduled?  Who does this, and I assume we need to reschedule for the new data?

Andrea,
Can you verify the spreadsheet of the deals you processed for Power, and send your updates back?

 << File: 0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls >> 


Thanks.  The goal is to have these settled in Unify for SAP transmission at 1pm.

Regan-

I'm still having a problem seeing those deals in Deal Entry.  If I run a search, it tells me that there are 'no records selected', which is very strange as I know there are at least 20 deals in there that have been entered by either myself or the EOL testers.  Any ideas?

Subject:	Revised East Power UBS Book Listing

As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!  

Thanks!

Frank,

I'm attaching a list of the curves East and West Power will be using at UBS.  You will be able to see that we aren't using near as many as we did in our "Enron days".  Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks!
Casey

Andrew-

I have created a draft of our RisktRAC book setup spreadsheet for East Power.  Can you take a look at it and see if everything is accurate.  One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field.  We had previously used 'US Power East', but this is not part of the dropdown menu in the field.  Has this location been changed to something else?

Thanks!

Andrea

Please review and let me ASAP know if anyone should be removed from this list for dual access to UBS and Enron applications.   Christina will keep the master and will make adjustments as you let one of the two of us know.  Thanks.  --Sally

Dear All,

Please test the Stage Release of PortCalc version 4.2.1s1 and let us know of the results.  

The executable is      /stage/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr        

	New Features:

Version 4.2.1s1

Changes Affecting All:

Asian strip

Fixed the Curve shift numbers in the adhoc table.

Basis Option

Fixed the issue on the break down of Peak and Off Peak curve shift for the second delivery point.

Changes Affecting Australia:

Asian strip

Always use curve price for effective date to avoid next-day financial true up for that day, so that current previous day value can tie up yesterday's value.

In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was  busily working when a new voice came over the intercom asking for a carry out at  check register 4. Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air,  and decided to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a  distantsmile caught his eye, the new  check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only  22) and he immediately fell in love.
 
Later that day, after his shift was over, he  waited by the punch out clock to find out her name. She came into the break room  and smiled softly at him and took her card and punched out and left. He looked  at her card - BRENDA. He walked out only to see her start walking up the  road.
 
The next day, he waited outside as she left  the supermarket, and offered her a ride home. He looked harmless enough, and she  accepted. When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again,  outside of work. She simply said it wasn't possible. He pressed and then she  explained she had two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter. So he  offered to pay for the baby-sitter. She reluctantly accepted his offer for a  date for the following Saturday.
 
That Saturday night he arrived at her door  only to have her tell him that she was unable to go out with him. The  baby-sitter had called and canceled. To which Kurtis simply said, "Well,  lets take the kids with us."
 
She tried to explain that taking the children  was not an option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed. Finally  Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who  was very cute, Kurtis thought. Then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.  He was born a paraplegic with Down's syndrome. Kurtis asked Brenda, "I  still don't understand why the kids can't come with us?"
 
Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away  from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her  first husband and father of the children did.
 
That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the  kids, went to dinner and the movies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would  take care of him. When he needed to use the restroom, he picked him up out of  his wheel-chair and took him. The kids loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening,  Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her  life with.
 
A year later, they were married and Kurtis  adopted both of her children and since then have added two more children to the  family.
 
So what happened to the stock boy and the  check out girl? Well, Mr. And Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he  is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays  quarterback.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 28 is:

veritable   \VAIR-uh-tuh-bul\   (adjective)
     : being in fact the thing named and not false, unreal, or
imaginary

Example sentence:
     Todd is a veritable wellspring of information on local
history and folklore.

Did you know?
     "Veritable," like its close relative "verity" ("truth"),
came to English through Middle French from Latin. It is
ultimately derived from "verus," the Latin word for "true,"
which also gave us "verify," "aver," and "verdict." "Veritable"
is often used as a synonym of "genuine" or "authentic" ("a
veritable masterpiece"), but it is also used to stress the
aptness of a metaphor, often in a humorous tone ("a veritable
swarm of lawyers"). In the past, usage commentators have objected
to the latter use, but today it doesn't draw much criticism.

Dear Stacey and Kristin-

I have attached the 2000 Doorstep report for UK and Continental Power.  Unfortunately, Gas, EGM and EIM are also co-mingled in this report.  I apologize.  I will bring to the planning meeting their responses and status of these findings (I unfortunately, cannot email these).  

Stacey - FYI, I kinda discussed this with Kristin.  But RAC is no longer going to play an active role in the doorstep process.  We are going to use their business expertise and concerns during the planning meeting, but other than that, they have agreed to be available on a "consulting" basis after that. 

I am working with Paul Day (Andersen Sr. Mgr in London) and Paul Bromley (London EAS) on either getting an Andersen deal tester for you all or just substituting Andersen's deal testing for ours.  Additionally, EAS has performed a Client Self Assessment (similar to a "what could wrong" or control analysis form).  I am trying to get a copy of that prior to you all leaving for the doorstep.

I hope to have more info by next week, but wanted to pass this along. Thanks,

Christy

I have been asked by legal to pull together the MTM value going forward plus the A/R and A/P balances.

Also, anything els that may relate to the counterparties we are still serving.

I know that Dec A/R and A/P are not correct at the moment.  Any estimate of cleaning up.

Let's talk today.

thanks

bob

Hi Mom's!  I hope everyone had a fun, relaxing  (yeah, right!) and safe holiday season!  Now it's back to reality, hee  hee!
 
Below are the notes from the January meeting we had  this past Tuesday.  Sorry they're getting out a bit late, trying to  check/confirm some items.  I may have missed some items, so let me know if  I did!
 
Anywho, a couple of notes from the  meeting:
 
Mom's With New  Babies
  -  Congratulations!!  We've had  several new additions this past month, and wanted to welcome all the wee little  ones to the group.
 
Mom's Night Out - Change Of  Venue
  -  Due to the circumstances surrounding  the bill for the Mom's Christmas party, it was decided to change the method of  payment for dinners.  We will now individually pay for our own  dinner/drinks, including tax and tip.  Appetizers will be handled the same  way - you "divvy" up the cost with those who ate it.  We will no  longer split the bill evenly among everyone.  We have had several instances  where people have ordered lesser valued meals or shared meals with someone, and  end up paying more then their share.  We hope this helps out the bill  situation, so we can all enjoy the entire evening!  We will have a  calculator handy (hopefully) so everyone can figure out tax and tip  accordingly.
 
Mom's Group Open  House
  -  We are going to host another Open  House inviting all Mom's and future Mom's to join our group.  This will be  scheduled for Tuesday, April 2nd.  I will reprint the newsletter  article.  I have shown Dianna Hadley as our wonderful hostess, so please  give her a call as we plan on having several people bring appetizers/drinks to  help.  It will be at the clubhouse, and we ask for Mom's to get there  around 6:30 or so to help "beautify" the place :)
 
Mom's Group Garage  Sale
  -  We are planning a spring garage sale  to coincide with the timing of the Winchester Trails bi-annual garage  sale.  I'm still trying to find out the date of their's (so if anyone  knows, let me know!) but we're hoping to have it sometime in March or  April.  Please stash your garage sale items in the meantime!  And if  you desperately need the space it's currently occuping, let me know and I will  try to find room for it.  We will also coordinate with a local charity to  pick up the remaining items after the sale.  We will ask that the charity  supply us with the necessary documentation for tax credit as well.  I will  be writing a brief article for the newsletter informing our subdivision of this  upcoming event.
 
Mom's Group Coobook  Sale
  -  We desperately need to sell the  remaining cookbooks.  We plan on having a booth at the Spring Festival and  the garage sale.  Also, ask your neighbors if they'd like one!  I've  tried a lot of the recipes and all I can say is YUM!
 
Mom's Group Food  Drive
  -  Thanks to Dianna and Laurel for  taking the time to store the food for the BMAC food drive we did for  Christmas.  I know Lacey Telge also took some food over, so thanks  Lacey!  And thanks to all the Mom's and neighbors who helped in making a  donation to the needy.  Dianna said the Bear Creek Ministry really  appreciated it.

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Dear all,

I have checked John and Fran's Terminal Servers. The setting is ready for UBS. I also copy some pure libary file back to the system. However, I have not worked on any other file. 

Please let me when the  files can be worked.

Thank you!

Stacey,

Based on Jeremy's responses below, looks like we can use an alternative interest rate curve and keep the USD without system changes.

Just 1 correction:

PostID Currency -  USD
PostID OTC Int Type Crv  - alternative Arg interest rate curve
Deal Currency - USD
Deal Level Interest curve - AA INT

Jeremy,

Just to make sure I understand correctly.

Let's assume the following:
PostID Currency -  USD
PostID OTC Int Type Crv  - alternative Arg interest rate curve
Deal Currency - USD
Deal Level Interest curve - alternative Arg interest rate curve

Results:  The portcalc would be valued using the alternative Arg interest rate curve.  This would require no special coding changes to ERMS.

Please confirm.  Thanks for the assistance.

Martha

If your Portcalc calcs. with an output currency code of "USD", and your deals are booked in TAGG to "AA INT" for Int (interest rate curve),
then PortCalc will use the interest rate curve you specify in your PostId.

Are your books EI-ARG-GAS and EI-ARG-GAS-TRSP? These 2 books do satisfy the above requirements, so if you specify an alternate
interest rate curve in your PostId, PortCalc will PV with that curve.

Jeremy,

Due to the high probability that the Argentine peso and the USD will NOT continue to be linked 1 to 1, we need to begin valuing the portfolios using an Argentina interest rate curve.  You and I spoke a couple of weeks ago and I recall that you thought it would require system changes.  After our conversation, I happened to notice a drop down field in TAGG called Int.  Is this field used to specify which interest rate curve is used to PV the portfolio regardless of the currency?  At this time we need to be able to specify USD but PV at an alternative curve.  Another option I though about was possibly adding a new currency called ArgUSD and having it use the alternative interest rate curve.

Let me know what your thoughts are on a solution for our problem.

Martha

I ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today.  I did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs, so we can just do this tomorrow.  The deals are on the 'East New as of 12-19' and the 'West New as of 12-19' tabs.

Shona,

Here is a breakout of total Wholesale Power p&l as of 11/30 that should roll up into your consolidated dpr as of 11/30.  There are separate tabs for east and west and the p&l is separated by commodity.  Let me know if this helps?!

Thanks!

Thank you for attending, or sending a proxy too, the UBSWE migration meeting this morning. Wanted to update you with some "late breaking news".

Legal will not have their compliance policy completed by close of business today, therefore we cannot publish all of the information that we covered in the meeting ... therefore we aren't going to migrate anyone on Sunday night as I had previously stated. So we have a little reprieve ....

There is a possibility that we will migrate everyone Monday night ... I will communicate as soon as I hear a definite answer.

We will continue to work through the issues/points you raised today (thank you, by the way).

I do need your assistance on one thing ... if you know of people that are gong to UBS but will have to work to support Estate contracts next week (outside of the schedulers, I already have their names down) could you send me a list of their names? 

Much thanks, and have a great Super Bowl weekend ...."stay tuned for more ...."

On Wed morning, we need to re-run all the calculations for Dec 31. We will be using Dec 31 vs Dec 18 and capturing all liquidations. For anyone who worked on the Dec 18 p/l we will be using the same procedures for prior day amounts.

Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you
have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than
likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we
are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as
setting up details of the new business.

Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with
you?

Stacey

If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.
713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this
e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang.

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?

Thanks.
-Tom

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom

stacey,

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

PS Also wondering about the green mountain one...

I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

I've simulated the Aggregate power portfolio's VAR with the BPA contract (approx. $51MM) as a stand alone (approx $3MM) and with the BPA position reversed out (approx $49MM).  Only issue seems to be that the VAR related to the position per credit Agg does not "tie" with VAR related to position in Enpower - I'm attributed this to the peak/off peak simulation difference.  Specifically, the credit agg file does not define what was peak or off peak, whereas file from Enpower did, resulting in more accurate measurement of risk.  Bottom line is that BPA removal appears to be risk reducing.

Dear Kathy,

I have checked your Terminal Server. The setting is ready for UBS. I also copy some pure libary file or application without Enron records back to the system and your Terminal Server. 

The Excel Version Position manager is ready for used. DprAutomation has been changed. The changes are on the production files.
 
Please let us know if there is any problem..

Thank you!

Min Zheng

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 6 is:

logomachy   \loh-GAH-muh-kee\   (noun)
    *1 : a dispute over or about words
     2 : a controversy marked by verbiage

Example sentence:
     "Quarreling about whether 'mathematics' and 'arithmetic'
mean the same thing is nothing but a ridiculous logomachy,"
Sheila declared stoutly.

Did you know?
     It doesn't take much to start people arguing about words,
but there's no quarrel about the origin of "logomachy." It comes
from the Greek roots "logos," meaning "word" or "speech," and
"machesthai," meaning "to fight," and it entered English in the
mid-1500s. If you're a word enthusiast, you probably know that
"logos" is the root of many an English word ("monologue,"
"neologism," "logic," and most words ending in "-logy," for
example), but what about other derivatives of "machesthai"?
Actually, this is a tough one even for word whizzes. Only a few
very rare English words come from "machesthai." Here are two of
them: "heresimach" ("an active opponent of heresy and heretics")
and "naumachia" ("an ancient Roman spectacle representing a
naval battle").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Make sure all price and volatility curves have been final posted in Curve Manager.

Contact Min Zheng (or whomever will be handling this for the estate) to run the script which writes the curves into the m:\power2\region Excel files (these are used by Structuring, EES and East Price if we were to run it again)

Calculate "East Bankruptcy Calc xx/xx/xx vs yy/yy/yy" 
-  Run it on 'Official Adhoc Full Book' and do not officialize upon completion
-  Use '/prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new' as your executable
-  email Debbie Brackett, Stephanie McGinnis and John Powell daily with the post-id for the calc

Calculate "Official East Non-Terminated Transactions xx/xx/xx vs yy/yy/yy" 
-  Run it on 'Official Adhoc Full Book' and officialize upon completion
-  Use 'default' as your executable

To run the rolls for Terminated and Non-Terminated books:
-  run DPR Automation (m:\common\power\estate\2002\0102\NEW) on both the East and EastBank portfolios separately
-  for the EAST-PERF book you'll need to also run DPR Automation on PCS/PID in the morning to pull in the liquidations.
-  link EAST-PERF, EAST-NPERF and EPMI-EAST-BANK into the Consolidated Report file
-  each day, copy the 'NEW' folder into the 'DATE SPECIFIC' folder and run the 'PRIOR-ESTATE' file located in the 'NEW'
	folder to run each roll's daily change macro

WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET
We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed in your  name,address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (the author of this piece who  happens to be an attorney) have first-hand knowledge, because my wallet was  stolen last month and within a week the thieves ordered an expensive monthly  cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line approved  to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change my driving  record information online, and more.
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this  happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your  credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your  card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them  easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was  stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step  toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
But here's what is perhaps most important: (I never ever thought to do  this.)
Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place  a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never heard of doing that until  advised by a bank that called to tell me and application for credit was made  over the Internet in my name. The alert means any company that checks your  credit knows your information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone  to authorize new credit. By the time I was advised to do this, almost 2 weeks  after the theft, all the damage had been done. There are records of all the  credit checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about  before placing the alert. 
Since then, no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my  wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems to have stopped them  in their tracks.
The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271
We  pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do think about passing  this information along. It could really help someone.

All -

I talked to Zhiyong Wei, who works for Jeff Johnson, and John Lavorato.  It sounds like there are a few issues that need to be resolved.

1.  Apparently it has been decided that someone (?) from UBS will be providing a curve beginning on day 1.  That person has yet to be identified.

2.  There will have to be a daily interpolation of the curve into ERMS on a daily basis.  This presents a couple of problems.  Someone must approve the interpolation, and the official curve does not come out until 5:00 P.M. Central Time.  This means that after the interpolation and system load,  it would probably be somewhere north of 6:00 PM before we could start our nightly process.  A difficult sell to say the least.

3.  There are offers out to two interest rate traders in Houston,  but we still have not determined whom we will be working with from a Houston perspective.  Hopefully,  decisions will be made by Monday.

Are you guys aware if there is a preliminary curve that we can use that comes out a bit earlier, and we can just have finance run with the official curve the next day?

Bottom Line : It sounds like they have worked out a process,  but not necessarily a great one.

Jeff

I've been working to resolve issues between PNL and curve shift history.  Here is the status.

?	The value-at-risk engine pulls curve shift from the source databases.  Specifically for power, using the DPR application (ad hoc table), curve shift for Jan 10th comes in at $246K, not the $415MM.  Because data isn't stored longer than one week, efforts are centered on restoring required info.
?	IT is "scrubbing" code and source tables to ensure proper curve shift is being used.
o	Coordination between both gas (ERMS) and power (Enpower) teams are critical.  $415MM curve shift day appears to be composed of both gas and power. (Although we are focused on Jan 9, 10th, issue is relevant throughout calendar year term)
?	As of this moment, the current curve shift data validates the VAR engine, yet appears to a have couple of incorrect days.  These incorrect days do not severely impacting VAR backtesting, however they represent a vastly different pnl.

The end game goal is to have curve shift correctly represented in the value-at-risk backtest data.

Stacey,

In talking with the Estate team, it sounds like they will be needing a few different types of info to help in the unwinding process.  In addition to the MTM reports you guys have been putting together, could we also do a delta position report by month?

Also, it would be helpful to get a list of deal specs and terms for each counterparty, basically like we were working on for David Forster before the bankruptcy.  I'll check with Kim Theriot on this as she was putting the list together before, but we will also want to get a MTM breakdown by deal for each counterparty.

These requests are not super urgent.  Basically I'd like to get the breakdowns sometime in the next week or two.  Hope that is OK, as I know you guys are inundated with requests at this time.

Let me know if you have any questions or if this overlaps with any other requests.

Thanks.

- Nick

During the IT Offsite held on 10/12/01,  we formed a team of IT and business leads to develop high level information flows within and between EES and WHS.  The team was directed to identify business areas that would benefit from the integration and potential sharing of systems.  Todd Busby and I are leading this effort.  

In summary, our 3 week project plan includes developing a baseline process and information flow diagram across EES and WHS for Jan. '02, recommendations to be implemented by June '02 and our business vision for one integrated EES/WHS system solution by June '03.  Beth Perlman provided Accenture on 10/15 to assist in the facilitation and analysis of the data gathered. 

Todd and I began the project on Monday, 10/15/01 and we will complete our initial analysis on Friday, 11/02/01 (3 week effort).  Last week we completed a project scope, schedule and initial high level information flow diagram which I have enclosed below.  In summary, we are holding approx. 5 workshops a week with the business leads in the integration team.  On Wednesday, 10/31, we will spend the day with EES/WHS IT to complete systems overlay's on our business process and information flows.  

I have sent invites for the meetings listed in the schedule below and look forward to working with you and your employees in the workshops.  

Please call me with questions and comments regarding our plan and deliverables.  

Thank you for your support on this effort.  

Debra

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for December 17 is:

conglobate   \kahn-GLOH-bayt or kun-GLOH-bayt\   (verb)
     : to form into a round compact mass

Example sentence:
     Jack alternately conglobated and flattened the bit of clay
as he talked.

Did you know?
     Sharp-eyed readers may have noticed the "globe" in
"conglobate." The "globe" connection goes all the way back to
Latin -- "conglobate" descends from the Latin verb "conglobare,"
which in turn comes from the prefix "con-" (meaning "with,
together") and "globus" (meaning "globe"). "Conglobare" also
means "to form into a ball," and in the 16th century it gave us
the word "conglobe," of the same meaning. A century after
"conglobe" first appeared in print, its cousin "conglobate"
arrived on the scene. You may be wondering if the word "glob" is
a relative too. "Glob" isn't linked directly to "conglobate," but
it does have a possible link to "globe." Etymologists think that
"glob" might have originated as a blend of "globe" and "blob."

John, so far, we have been able to get 1998 back for you, it is located at \\nahou-dv16\dpr98, you can either click this link or go to Start, Run and type in the link.

We are working on getting 1999, the files were archived on another server which has been decommissioned, we have the files on tape which we will have to retrieve the data from.

I will let keep you informed of our progress.


Thank You

Let's talk about Weather Alert on Weds.  It seems that checks sent out pre-petition are being presented to be bank and there are no funds in the account.  Who is the parent of Weather Alert?  Do we know of any reason that we need to honor these checks?

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Stacey, figured out where 88MM of our 89MM difference is between the two portfolios. Duplicate deal with Powerex. Mid C is out about 1MM so I will look at it when I get back.

Call me at home if needed.

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Andrea:

Thanks for doing that for us.  I also did a check by looking at ad hoc exported after the bankruptcy calc is done.  I believe there might be some deals that were missing in the process of changing the deals and moving them from west portfolio to bankruptcy portfolio.  I will be out starting from 12/17 on vacation.  I will ask John to confirm if there are more changes needed for the cleanup.

Thanks again,
Fran

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

I have attached two Excel files representing the P&L by counterparty for all deals in the East and West Bankruptcy portfolios.  Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

John,

Currently, there is no way we can meet this need.  The information we get from EOL does not include a desk id and we must determine the id based on the criteria given below.  

There are two possible solutions
1)  Add one or more other fields as criteria for determining the desk.
2)  Have EOL send the desk id in the bridge message.

Although I cannot speak for EOL IT, I suspect that solution 2 would be very involved.  I doubt that traders are even able to select a desk when creating a product in EOL.  Melba, can you verify this fact?

If option 1 is doable from a business perspective, we will need to discuss further the changes and timeline involved for IT.  This issues should be raise in the meeting with Steve Nat tomorrow.

Regards,
Will

Will, due to the changing circumstances, the West and Canada have traders using multiple books, multiple regions for phys and Fin. Can we work around this or make a change that would not be too complicated?

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of "NETCO Long Term Southwest" after I have added him as the trader for "NETCO Long Term California",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise. 

Thanks,

Fran

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

All,

I have modified Deal Liquidation as follows (new version in stage).

1.)  You can now query based on counterparty and phys/fin in addition to specifying a deal number
2.)  You no longer need to provide the leg of the deal.  Specifying the peer will grab all of the legs.
3.)  The new splitting process will work as follows.
If the entire deal is prior to the termination date (inclusive), then nothing is done to the deal.
If the entire deal is after the termination date (exclusive), then the desk is simply changed to East Bank or West Bank.
If the deal crosses the termination date boundary, the deal is copied as follows:
For the original deal:
All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not changed.
All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are killed.
All legs crossing over the termination date are truncated.  This includes deleting strips starting after the date and truncating strips that cross over the date.

For the new deal:  This deal will be in one of the Bankruptcy books
All legs prior to the termination date (inclusive) are not copied.
All legs after the termination date (exclusive) are copied as is - no strips are changed.
Any legs crossing over the termination date are copied and modified to reside solely after the date.  This includes deleting strips that end prior to the date and modifying strips that cross over the date.

These changes should allow you to perform all of the tasks necessary to close out deals with any counterparty.

Please test and let me know if there are any problems.

Regards,
Will

All-

The Curve Validation folder/repository has been setup on the O drive and includes the following folder structure (bold names are those items with subfolders):

O:\Curve Validation	
2001 Reporting
Consolidated
EES
EGM Financial
Enron Americas
US Gas
US Power
Canada Gas
Canada Power
Enron Broadband Services
Enron Global Assets
Enron Global Markets (excl. Financial)
EGM Financial
Enron Industrial Markets
Procedures and Template
	(the reporting template, procedures and rollout document are included here)


I've already requested access for you based on the validation team structure, Exhibit A in the procedures mailed last week. This request should hopefully be done by mid-week.  Going forward if additional personnel in your groups need access to the folders,  please have them fill out an e-request.  The requests will come to me and I will call the RM personnel on each team to clear access rights.   

Let me know if you have any questions.


Regards

KC
