ISO Market Participants:
The California ISO is considering several modifications to the Automated
Dispatch System (ADS) to increase its usability and to provide additional
information to Scheduling Coordinators through the system.  These include:
*	providing additional real-time dispatch information through ADS;
*	modifying the query system to allow additional report generation
capability; and 
*	providing SCs with summary information of schedules, expected and
actual generation in real-time.  
To assist the ISO in assessing which new features would be beneficial, we
request your comments on the features we are proposing for development.
Additionally, the ISO would appreciate receiving ideas for additional
features not yet considered by the ISO.
We have posted on the ISO web site a white paper describing the proposed
modifications.  You can access the paper at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/12/200006121229457917.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/12/200006121229457917.html> .
Please send your comments on the proposed design, as well as ideas for
further development, to Greg Ford at gford@caiso.com
<mailto:gford@caiso.com>  by October 15, 2001.

	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or
e-mail me.

Due to problems earlier today with the CAISO's outbound e-mail, this is a
duplicate of a message sent this morning.  Please disregard this notice if
you have already received it.
ISO Market Participants:
In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") June 19 order, the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ("ISO") was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions.  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all in-state load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs.  In compliance, the ISO filed, on July 10, 2001, proposed Tariff
revisions to develop:
1.	a rate for the emission allowance charge, 
2.	an escrow account for monies collected; 
3.	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees; and 
4.	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs.  
In a Market Notice posted on August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate.  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html> .
The June 19 FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude start-up fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price, and instead, to
pay generators for such start-up fuel costs, in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees.  In a Market Notice posted on
August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial start-up fuel charge rate.
The ISO has modified the previously posted start-up fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this

SC Settlement Contacts:  
This notification serves to describe the California ISO charge types
associated with the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP).  The DLCP
was designed to provide an additional level of demand reduction on the ISO
system before the ISO entered into Emergency conditions.  DLCP Load
participants agree to voluntarily interrupt Load at ISO request in
accordance with DLCP contracts and ISO operating procedures.  The program
was implemented as a result of forecasted periods of high-energy usage
during summer 2001.  The program was implemented once, on July 3, 2001.  The
charges associated with DLCP will be included on the July 31, 2001
Settlement Statement. 

Charge Type 3473	
		Description: DLCP Energy Payment.  

		Settlement Amount: The product of billable quantity and
price 
		Billable Quantity:  Performance measurement submitted to the
ISO based on the DLCP Participant's approved Measurement Plan. 

		Price =  $350 per MWh.

Charge Type 3483
		Description: DLCP Energy Charge.

		Settlement Amount : (SC's total Monthly Load and Exports /
Total Monthly Load and Exports) x Total Monthly payment for Discretionary
Load Curtailment Program.

		Billable Quantity:  Sum of monthly Load and Exports. 

		Price:   Settlement Amount / Billable Quantity.

Load and Exports will be assessed on a Control Area basis and will not
include Non-PTO load served under an Existing Contract.

ISO Market Participants:
In recent days and weeks, there have been many scams perpetrated by con
artists on the Internet to "help the victims of NYC and Washington D.C."
Now we are seeing unscrupulous people spreading computer viruses by using
what happened on September 11.   
An email is circulating the Internet with an attachment infected with the
Trojan_Vote.A (also known as Vote Virus, W32.Vote.a@mm
<mailto:W32.Vote.a@mm> , VBS Vote.A).
The email looks like this:
Subject: Fwd: Peace BeTween AmeriCa And IsLam!
Message: Hi! iS iT A waR Against AmeriCa Or IsLam! Let's Vote To Live in
Peace!
Attachment:  WTC.EXE
This destructive, mass-mailing Trojan was created using Visual Basic 5. It
propagates via Microsoft Outlook by sending emails to all addresses listed
in an infected user's address book.  It deletes certain anti-virus products
installed in a system, drops the files WTC.exe MixDaLaL.vbs, and Zacker.vbs.
It also modifies the infected user's Internet Explorer startup page, and
formats the infected user's drive c:\.   It parses drives and directories in
search of HTM and HTML files and overwrites them.
This malicious program is spreading rapidly, so be aware and take
precautions to avoid it.  The ISO suggests the following precautions:
*	DELETE - DO NOT OPEN - Unsolicited email messages with attachments
from unknown sources.
*	When in doubt, DELETE it.
*	Scan all attachments from unknown sources.

ISO Market Participants:
Since Trade Month November 2000 (which settled beginning in January 2001),
payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than the
full amount due Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) in the monthly cash clearing
process.  The purpose of this message is to describe the ISO's policies and
procedures in settling the market when defaults occur.  
As set forth in Section SABP 6.7.4 of the ISO Tariff, when payment defaults
occur from SCs that have obligations to the ISO's markets (Debtor SCs), the
shortfall is to be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them (Creditor SCs)
based on their outstanding balances. The principles that drive how amounts
are settled and defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below:
Proportionate allocation of defaults - The total amount of market defaults
is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each
Creditor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount
receivable for the month.  SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on
a monthly basis as described below.  The intent of the Tariff is to
equitably distribute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net
market receivables for the period.  
Each month is treated as a whole period - Final and preliminary invoices are
combined when possible (see exception conditions below) in allocating market
defaults.  Cash payments from the market are received in two stages
(preliminary and final).  At preliminary, market payments are distributed
based on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the
preliminary invoices. Final invoices serve essentially as true-ups to the
preliminary invoices, and accordingly, payments received at final are
redistributed to the extent possible to achieve true-up allocations for the
whole month considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both
the preliminary and final invoices.
Each month is treated as a discrete period - Market defaults are generally
allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being
settled.  The exceptions to this rule involve (1) SCs that are Creditor SCs
in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods
or (2) Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for
prior months.  In the first instance, the Creditor SC would not be paid to
the extent of default obligations from prior months.  Amounts due to the
Creditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds
would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period. In
the second instance the current month's payment is carried back and applied
first to the oldest outstanding balance. The proceeds would be distributed
to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs unpaid
balances in that month.  With respect to the carry back of payments to the
earliest period, Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from
different SCs.
GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments  - GMC is
billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final
invoices each month.  In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices
(at either preliminary or final), market funds are transferred to satisfy
GMC obligations before any market distributions are made.  This first
priority position for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP 6.3.1.3 of
the ISO Tariff.  Therefore, when both GMC and market defaults occur (as has
occurred in each of the past few months), the Creditor SCs have two
reductions to the market clearing amounts ultimately paid - an allocated
portion of the GMC default, and an allocated portion of the market default.
RMR invoices and payments are not affected by market or GMC defaults - The
RMR invoicing process involves amounts due from the PTO's to the RMR Owners
as set forth in monthly invoices processed through the ISO's systems.
However, such amounts are invoiced independent of the ISO's market and GMC
billing processes, and accordingly, market and/or GMC defaults do not impact
RMR related payments. 
There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of
allocating cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur.  Some of these factors
include:
*	amounts received after payment date deadlines - such amounts are
typically included in the next distribution
*	market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the
current month - such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount
of the GMC default by the Creditor SC
*	allocations to prior months - not made unless the amount exceeds
0.5% of that months billed amounts
*	small invoices under $5,000 are paid in full rather than the
allocated percentage.
For more information about these allocation issues or any other related
matters, please contact Melodie Iverson (916) 351-2174 (e-mail
mkiverson@caiso.com <mailto:miverson@caiso.com> ) or Mike Epstein (916)

 Must-Offer Obligation to Units With Long Start-up Times

ISO Market Participants:
As announced in a market notice last Thursday, July 19, the ISO is
considering new processes for implementing the must-offer obligation that
would permit compliance with the FERC's Order and also take into
consideration the particular concerns of generating units with long start-up
times and operating costs that may not be fully recoverable during periods
of relatively low Energy prices.  
The ISO has posted on its web site a Draft Proposal that is intended to
provide Market Participants with an opportunity to comment upon and discuss
some modifications the ISO is considering to the procedures described in
last Thursday's market notice that addressed granting a "Temporary Waiver of
Must-Offer Obligation."   You can find the draft at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html> .
Please return your written comments to me by 5:00 p.m. PDT on Friday, July
27. You may e-mail your comments to bwoertz@caiso.com
<mailto:bwoertz@caiso.com)> .  As we indicated last Thursday, the ISO plans
to hold a conference call to discuss this proposal and stakeholders'
comments.  We will send details on the call in the next day or two.  In
addition, we hope to issue a written response to comments we receive by
Friday prior to the conference call.
