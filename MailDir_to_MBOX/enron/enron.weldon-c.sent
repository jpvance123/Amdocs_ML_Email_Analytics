>From the Street.com....

Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork 
with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the 
new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this 
pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities 
sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities 
unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways 
to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

Okay the results are in, and they are ugly.
 Enron's offer acceptance rate from UT was a whopping 2 candidates this year.

This is out of 9 offers extended!


I sent an email hoping to spike interest in the UT team to go to Austin, 
generate interest in first year candidates and to have fun over a few toddies 
before interviews.

So far I have had no confirmed response for this event.  Please keep in mind, 
for this to be a successful Spring recruiting season the participation of 
team members is needed.  Even though a major complaint from candidates was 
our salary ranges, I also feel the team and I did a poor job of candidate 
cultivation. Campus recruiting is fun, but it also takes dedication and team 
work.  We must really show a strong presence on campus this Spring in order 
to show the candidates how exciting Enron truly can be.  Part of the 
attraction for any candidate is to work for a company whose employees have 
fun attitudes and personalities.  I know most of you possess these attributes 
so lets take that to campus and get some awesome intern candidates!

In order to help solve the schedule problems that some of you expressed I am 
changing the date.  Please see below:

What:  First Year Candidate Cultivation and Targeting Opportunity

When:  Tuesday, February 6th

Where:  Scholz's Bier Garten, or Fado Irish Pub

Time:  7:00pm to ?

We will hold this event on a Tuesday since we can partner it with the Eyes of 
Texas Career Fair and because the closed list is due 2 days later.  The whole 
purpose of this event is to gather names of interested and qualified 
candidates and to get Enron's name back on campus.

*  If you are able to attend the Eyes of Texas Career Fair as well that event 
will begin at 2pm and end at 5:30pm. 

If you are interested and/or have suggestions on how to make this event more 
successful please contact me immediately.  



Thank you,

should the Calendar still be in use; and
can V. Charles Weldon be given access to the Calendar.

Hi everyone, and sorry for the delays all this is causing...

The G&P calendar has not been used for months (ie.:  at least for the past 2 
years...!).  I would not foresee any inconvenience with anyone using it.
The request originally came almost 3 years ago from when I was working in 
London (for the Gas & Power Trading groups).  Since then, I have moved to the 
Madrid office and Lauren Urquhart has replaced me (with ext. 7359).

I would suggest you maybe get in touch with Rachel Adams and see if she would 
like to become the new "owner" of this calendar (if she sees any current 
benefit in still having one), considering her important role on the trading 
floor in London.  

You can go ahead and erase my name from the owner list once you have a new 
one.

Best regards,
Iris

I would recommend selling Intel today. It is up with the market this morning

John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie

Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or 
think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really.  
If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present 
or something.  

Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet 
so it should be perfect.

Charlie

Kristin,

Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you 
requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in 
many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other 
stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not 
the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate 
stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume 
whoever needs this info has one.

Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good 
representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be 
perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better 
data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)


Thanks,

Charlie

No problme.  I enjoy helping out.  Just tell them to send you $2000.  You 
should have at least that in cash.  If there is any extra leftover and you 
need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.  Enron is 
up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.  Love,  Charlie

Charlie, I got your pictures - thank you - they were neat and I am
looking forward to the rest of them.  I am anxious to hear about your
trip but I know that you are probably still trying to recuperate from
your trip so call me when you feel rested.  I have class tonight and
will leave about 3:00 and won't get home until 11:00 so obviously
tonight won't be good.  When I call to sell my Merck and 5 shares of
Enron will they send me a check?  I can't remember how it works.  Once
again I want to thank you for watching out for me and my family with
these investments - I know it is time consuming but very much
appreciated.  God Bless You!  Love, Margaret

I finally awoke sometime later.  Our trip was pretty good but the game kinda 
sucked.

Hey Dude,

How was the superbowl gathering?  You were cracking me up when I called
the other evening.  Next time, just tell Melissa to let you sleep. :)

This weekend was pretty low key.  I purchased some really good books on
web marketing.  I've been studying them, and in the next couple of
months, I'm going to put together an agressive plan to market the web
site.  I will send you copies of the details for your review.

In the meantime there is some computer coding and other structural stuff
I need to get in place for the web site to be easier to maintain and
update.

Later,

B-

I agree.  Even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the 
fact that (if) EBS is not fundamentally successful.

 So the question is, is there a way to go long ENE and short EBS?  Probably 
not, but if there were a surrogate for EBS, the trade might work in most 
scenarios.  How about shorting a long-term broadband contract?

I saw it.   After our conversation, I did add some Citi and Wachovia and have 
since lost but I still think it's a good move.  Hopefully there will not be 
any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards 
the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.

 I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.  I'm pretty balanced 
now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).

ENE closing at $72+!!!!!

I 'm pretty sure that we made an equity investment in a fuel cell company but 
I'm not sure which one.  We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy

I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.  It was 20 miles west of Menard 
on Hwy 190.  A great area that's for sure.

Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far:

1)  17", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest 
ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.

2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17", 11 point with a double main 
beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.

3) Travis shot a 16"  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.

We've seen more bucks than we have since '93.  More fawns than I ever 
remember.  Maybe things have turned around for awhile.  I've got some good 
videos I'll show sometime.  When are ya'll coming?

sounds somewhat believable.  I can imagine the frenzy on the discussion 
boards if that got out.  I won't be the one to put it out there.

i think one more year and then its done.  Would the motivation for the Aggie

I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.  It 
may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it 
doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.

By the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It's showed me a profit you 
know.....

Subject: Hurricane Warning Derivatives

Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

We'll probably come down on the 21st.  If you are still there then maybe we 
can hook up and go out there together and laugh away the deer.  

How does a January/February trip up to Grapevine sound?

Oh yeah, Melissa's pregnant.  Due first week in August.  It's early so we are 
being cautious but I figured you would want to know.

Remi,

Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high 
quality job in your PRC representative role.  Per your request, I am 
attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last 
few months. 

I am currently in my first rotation as an Associate which I  began this past 
summer following graduation from UT with an MBA in Energy Finance.   I am 
assigned to Vince Kaminski's Research Group on the Market Fundamentals Team.  
This team is commonly referred to as the "Weather Group" and is headed by my 
supervisor, Mike Roberts.  We are located on the gas trading floor (32nd) and 
provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives 
trading.

Thanks again for your interest and I am looking forward to meeting you.   
Please let me know if you need any additional information.


Sincerely,

Charlie Weldon

Dear all,

I believe that I will be your global PRC Representative on the 12th/13th of 
December.  For those who don't know me, I'm currently VP Trading & Risk 
Management in our S?o Paulo office, dealing with power and gas.  I'm very 
glad to be one of the reps in PRC, despite the work involved, because I truly 
believe that the best assets of our company are its employees.  I want to do 
my best to represent you fairly and actively.

In order to facilitate my task, I would really appreciate that all of you 
forward to me, by email:

1. a list of your accomplishments in year 2000 (should be not more than 10 to 
12 bullet points, telegraphic style)
2. a decently recent resume, that shows your school, previous work experience 
and start date at Enron.
3. a list of all of your rotations at Enron since hired.

4. In addition, I commit to call your supervisor as listed in PEP system to 
discuss your performance

5. I would also like to meet all of you before PRC meetings: I believe that 
you are either based in South America or in Houston (if that was not the 
case, please let me know by email, we'll speak on the phone).  For those 
based in S?o Paulo, call me and visit at our mutual convenience during the 
week of 4 to 8 December.  For those based in Houston, please call Samira (her 
phone is (55) 11 5503 1200) and schedule a half-hour meeting with me on 
Monday December 11, if you are in town.  I will be in Houston and should stay 
in 3AC1439 (or not far from there).  If you are based in Houston but out of 
town the 11th, let me know in advance, I'll speak to you on the phone.

I hope we'll run this process smoothly.  I look forward to meeting all of you,

Remi

Charlie,  I received my check from Bidwell for $2,023. and some change.
I have an IRA form for my 2001 contribution from Fidelity.  Is there
anything I need to do besides fill out the form and mail a check?

I talked to Mama yesterday - she said your house was looking good.  I
signed Travis up for the Pony League baseball - it will be a lot
different from Little League and I think he is a little nervous but so
is everyone else that is moving up.  Elizabeth is doing the reading for
mass at school on Thursday - it is the first grade class turn again and
she did the responsorial psalm last time.  Her two main teachers told
the religion teacher that Elizabeth would have to read again because the
reading was long and complicated and Elizabeth was the only one that
would be capable of doing it.  I was really proud - not bad for a
daughter that was supposed to be retarded- I always feel like telling
the doctor's that they don't know everything.  Anyway, I hope you'll are
doing great and let me know about my contribution.  Love, Margaret

Hi guys,

Please treat this as strictly confidential

Please take action ASAP

As you all know, the Enron Associate 2001 offers haven't been very popular 
among MBAs. Given the fact that December is decisions month and that, given 
the company growth, we cannot afford lose a new breed of highly qualified 
people, the following has been decided:

Present a proposal to Jeff Skilling today in order to improve the current 
offers. The proposal will be presented this afternoon, after two 
Associates-Skilling-HR interactions (in which Skilling expressed more than 
once his concern about Enron offers being so low compared to the market 
...I-Banks, Consulting firms).

Select one alumni per B-School represented in the 2000 Associate Class, you!

Authorize those representatives to send a standard e-mail (text provided 
below) to the candidates who got offers in their respective B-Schools, in 
order to gain some time until the official HR communication (hopefully caring 
good news) is submitted.

The standard e-mail should read EXACTLY as follows (we are not authorized to 
change or add anything):

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

To MBA students considering joining the Enron Associate Program,

I wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that a proposal to change 
the Associate compensation package has recently been presented to Jeff 
Skilling.  A decision concerning the recommended change is expected in the 
next few days.  More information will be provided as soon as possible.  Have 
a nice weekend!

Regards,

Representative Signature

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We are asking you to the send the e-mail under your name because we want this 
notification to be informal. We have the authorization to do it this way.

In case you are contacted by any candidate, the offical position should be 
consistent with the one in the e-mail: a decision is expected very soon, we 
will let you know asap.

Please bcc me when you send the message, since it is important to keep track 
about which B-School candidates have been notified.

Thanks a lot for your help and quick response,

Roberto Conterno

I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.  He was pretty old 
and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and 
intelligent man.  About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont 
and I stayed over the weekend with him.  He took me all around Salt Lake City 
and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.  That's what I will remember about him 
most.

Hold off on the reservations as I cannot get hold of her.  She may want to

if we did want to fly.  Also, could Melissa and Hunter go also.

Subject: Results of Super Saturday

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Charlie, I don't know if you'll have any plans for the superbowl but if
you would like to come to Galveston you are more than welcome.  We will
be at Pop's house - Jimmy's brothers will be there - we are going to
plan the menu this evening but last night Mitchell and I decided some
nice heavy h'or'dourves (sp?) might be nice - and anything Mitchell
cooks is really worth the dive.  Anyway let me know.  Love, Margaret

If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit 
or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are 
indeed pathetic salesmen. These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh 
if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.

Andrew,

Can we move tomorrow's meeting to 5:00 instead of 3:00?   I have a 
structuring class all day.  Mark will need to leave at ~5:30 so I'll try to 
be up here a little early if possible.  I'll send a nother note with a

Subject: Stagecoach gas questions

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP "cost of 
carry" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any "IN STORAGE"  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES "pick" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

Indeed.  If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as 
intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to 
directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach 
$10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?

A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next 
week.

The taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.  It 
will be much less than $2000.  For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron 
stock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain.  
I'll look at it tonight.

Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?


Later,

I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.   He 
definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.  I 
believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.  His 
interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.  I'll take 
over 800 yds next year if you take under.

Subject: Results of Super Saturday

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Charlie, I don't know if you'll have any plans for the superbowl but if
you would like to come to Galveston you are more than welcome.  We will
be at Pop's house - Jimmy's brothers will be there - we are going to
plan the menu this evening but last night Mitchell and I decided some
nice heavy h'or'dourves (sp?) might be nice - and anything Mitchell
cooks is really worth the dive.  Anyway let me know.  Love, Margaret

How is recruiting going?   Any idea where you think you will end up.  I'm

She hasn't heard it yet as she was feeling so bad yesterday.  I'll take the

time I can bare to be around you.

Dude,

When Melissa gets her pictures developed, can you see if they can put
them on a CD?  That's what Kathleen is doing, and it will make things a
lot easier since we can avoid the scanning process.

What did she think of the audio?

Finally, I still have your "invitation" that you bought at the airport.
It was a good thing to buy because the one I received in the mail is
just like it.

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating 
that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged 
to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM 
method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.


Charlie

A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the 
near future.

I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I 
would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 
2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" 
or otherwise contribute.

I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your 
knowledge of business, etc.

We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm 
looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around.  
I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others 
later tonight.

When is the website going to have our pictures?


Thanks,

Charlie

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Bobby

I think I better stick around my new job for a little longer before I run 
off.  I've got a training class again next week so I'm going to be out 2 days.

I think I'm going to Austin in late Feb for the internship interviews.

This guy has amazingly good 20/20 hindsight.  He's painting the Fed as behind 
the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this New Economy.  In 
fact, it was Greenspan's willingness to embrace the New Economy's higher GDP 
"speed limit" and unemployment "floor" that enabled this unprecedented 
economic expansion.  While it is true that the Fed's tightening is largely 
responsible for this downturn, it is not solely responsible; and it is the 
Fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will 
prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road.

I have a meeting in Cuero at 10:00 am this Saturday that will last only an 
hour or so.  Other than that, we have no reason to go.  Maybe you could fly 
me to that?
If so, I'll need to ask Melissa.  She would not haev to go in that case and 
can stay and recuperate.

This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) 
newsletter.....


BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10.

I just bought some more CPN.  CEFT has a great 5 yr chart and doesn't seem 
too expensive but I don't understand their business risks as much as CPN so 
I'm going to stick with them.  I may give it some more thought if I could 
find a good research report on them.

Rebecca,

I was looking in EHROnline at my available vacation to verify that it all got 
accounted for correctly in 2000.  It appears that it did except for the fact 
that when I attempted to view my available vacation for 2001, it only 
indicates that I have 120 hours available.  I should have an additional 16 
hours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left 
over.  Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 
and buy the tickets for $125.   This does sound like a good one to go to 
based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.  I imagine 
(hope) that the other balls are comparable.

I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated.

Slightly different subject,  check this link out.  Kiper seems to indicate 
that you must be a 3rd year soph or a junior to enter the draft.  Is this 
true?
  Does it mean rising junior or completed junior?  Implications for Roy W. 
and UT?

In the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)

  Worker Dead at Desk For 5 Days

     Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed
  that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE
DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.

     George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New
  York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he
  shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody
  noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.

      His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in
each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that
  he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself."

      A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days
  after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proofreading
  manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

He sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about.  I'll 
be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good Hayter is.  BEnson is 
the 4th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great Robert 
Strait from Cuero (85-88) and almost passing Rodney Thomas.  Those guys don't 
get redshirted.

I'm befuddled about the O-line numbers.  Ya'll got this kid Winston this 
weekend over us even though we have only one OL commit and need 4 or so.  
Slocum  has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we 
are doomed.  2 of the top 3 linemen are still available and we've got a 
reasonable shot at them but Hightower (#1) still says he's going to visit and 
consider Texas.  Amazing...

We likely will come unless we are still too sick.  We've all still got the 
"crud".  I'll call tomorrow evening and let you know.

Melissa said that she could/would make a "Football" cake if you want.  Just 
let me know when I call as I will not get any more e-mails today.

Check out NOK Feb 55 puts, NZYMK.X  They are up 4-5/8 while NOK is down  
4-5/8.  2932 contracts out wth 24 traded today so liquidity shouild be OK.

Buy 400 ERICY for ~$4000 and one NOK put contract of NZYMK.x.  That should 
give you a delta on NOK equiv to shorting $4000 of the stock.

Did I figure this right?

WE'll likely move Joe Weber to FB.  He's ~225 lbs and pretty fast for a FB so 
he'll do.  Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named 
Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on 
the scout team.  I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that 
good.  He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last 
few years of recruiting.

Kristin,

The software has arrived.  I have not had a chance to check it out yet but 
will do so ASAP.  I've been gone for the last 4 working days.

Dave,

Just wondering if you have had a chance to consider these new risk management 
tools we are considering.

Subject: Enron Weather Derivatives

Dave,

Thanks for taking time to talk with me the other day.   To recap what I was
asking you to consider, we at  Enron currently have two different weather
derivative products under development that we believe could be of interest
to Dupont.   One of the products involves protection against
hurricane-related production disruptions.  The exact form of the product
could vary but would generally provide for coverage against lost revenues
due to hurricane warnings or general proximity of hurricanes near the
coastline.  We would be able to structure this offer with maximum
flexibility with regard to category of hurricane, level of coverage, exact
proximity, and pricing (swaps or options).

The other product line we are considering is a drought-related product that
keys off of low riverflow values on various river basins in Texas.   We
believe that the Guadalupe River in particular is susceptible to extremely
low riverflow values that could potentially result in production
disruptions to the downstream chemical industry that relies on the river to
meet cooling needs.  A review of 50 years of riverflow data (from the US
geological survey) suggests that if a drought of the magnitude of the one
in the 1950's were to reoccur, there is potential for multiple prolonged
production disruptions to many of the large chemical plants on this river,
including the Victoria Dupont plant.   The exact form of coverage offerred
would again depend on your specific needs.

Both of these products are in a stage that we need to determine whether or
not there is sufficient market interest to warrant further development.
Your feedback on whether or not these products might be of any interest to
you would be greatly appreciated.

On one other note, you mentioned that the agricultural business of Dupont
was considering some rainfall derivative contracts for hedging purposes.
We are very interested in discussing your needs versus our capabilities
with regard to this type of product.   Our marketing contact for this
subject is Valter Stoiani and he can be contacted by phone at 713-853-6906
or by E-mail at valter.stoiani@enron.com.


Thanks again,

I think I messed up - I only sold 20 shares of Merck not all of them and I
sold 5 shares of Enron.  Merck was down and sold at market for $79 and Enron
was up and sold at 80 and 11/16.  He said this would settle on the 29th.  He
said my cash balance in the account is $2,023.  Let me know if I need to call

I'll let you know where you can go.  Probably pretty much anywhere in Buddy's 
or I might can arrange for you to sit in another area.  It won't be a problem 
but we will need to communicate.

 Right now my friend Weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a 
deer in 6 years and has paid my Dad ~$5000 over the period.  Paul is still 
hunting in there too and that's where Travis killed his deer.  



Check out the following link on the weather:

Take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are 
automated and tend to spit out some garbage.  However, a true blue norther 
should be coming and don't be surprised if Dallas sees the teens next week 
with highs below freezing.

Why don't you buy deep in the money put options?  They will have a high delta

Gary,

Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.

Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
opinion.

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html


One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.

Please let me know how I may be of assistance.


Thanks,

Charlie

Judy,

Thanks for the info.  I hope you had a good holiday season.  I regret to=20
inform you that I will be unable to continue in my participation in JA.  I=
=20
have transitioned to a new role at Enron that will not accomodate the=20
schedule neccesary to effectively serve as a JA volunteer.    I  take my=20
commitments very seriously so my inability to fulfill this obligation is no=
t=20
something I am totally comfortable with.  However, upon reviewing the=20
situation I realize that this decision is necessary.

Thank you for your help and energy and I wish you all the luck with the kid=
s=20
and the program.  What you do is truly making a positive difference in many=
=20
of these kids' futures.


Charlie Weldon

Subject: JA Company Program


Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Judy Wirzberg

Sorry I did not get to call last night.  I'll try tonight after 8:00.

Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address?
Your duplicate statements have been going to my old address in Austin.  My 
new address is 13006 Brayton Court, Houstno, TX 77065.

You will also need to sell $2000 of stocks in your Bidwell account and make 
your 2001 IRA  contribution to this IRA account as we have done the last 
several years.  We'll talk about what to sell later.

Love,

Charlie

Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good 
buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she "owed" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this 
week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the 
subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to "prove" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.


Thanks!

Charlie

Here's the link to the gas fundamentals website that I mentioned.  It has a 
wealth of information on it, some of which the group can hopefully utilize.

Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 
forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 
on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great 
market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, 
right?  What's your view?

The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this 
is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got 
the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin 
pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high 
growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of 
the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.

Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This 
could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity.

December 2000, "Worth" magazine=20
=20
Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=
t=20
of the new economy.=20
 =20
Enron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20
hates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company's=
=20
downtown
Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=
=20
haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=
=20
markets=20
were highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron's three=
=20
commodity-trading floors =01* the company's nerve centers, where it buys an=
d=20
sells products=20
ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20
often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. "That's=20
how you find out what's going on," he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=
=20
online
 presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=
g=20
to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=
=20
and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. "In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company," says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. "Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient." Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=
s=20
trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=
=20
and data storage. "Trading is the ultimate scalable concept," adds Skilling=
.=20
"We're
 using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20
potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited."

Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=
h=20
at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=
e=20
big
 question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20
Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20
doesn't=20
unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.

"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy."
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=
=20
in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known," sa=
ys=20
Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20
consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. "I've made it clea=
r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor." The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. "We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas," Lay says. Take Michae=
l=20
Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. "Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country," says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=
s=20
who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20
meteorologists=20
on its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi=
ng=20
cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=
at=20
could affect=20
supply and demand.

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=
=20
deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20
Scandinavia=20
in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20
making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20
still loom large and=20
national differences present formidable hurdles. "We're the only company wi=
th=20
pan-European operations," says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. "There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult."

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
"the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in," says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. "Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity."

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. "Video will be the king application," Skilling says. "That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen."

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. "The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail," says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20
sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20
in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=
=20
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=
=20
target to=20
land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.=
=20
"There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f=
ew=20
years,"=20
Lay says.

"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=
=20
but their track record warrants that."
=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham

The Competition
Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=
he=20
deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.
 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=
nd=20
called "Enron Jr." by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=
=20
same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=
=20
Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20
energy-trading=20
system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=
e=20
(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards
 for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20
product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20
business,=20
Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=
l=20
utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.

"It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20
always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations."
=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=
=20
its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=
es
 are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=
=20
$80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=
=20
valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=
=20
$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=
=20
energy=20
is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20
year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And=
=20
wholesale=20
energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=
he=20
next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20
markets.=20
Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=
=20
broadband,=20
not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=
ng=20
argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.

Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20
higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=
s=20
still=20
a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=
=20
Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20
potential=20
of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=
=20
market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=
=20
mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=
=20
for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=
r=20
=01* and
 maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=
 $92.

Social Responsibility
Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=
=20
methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=
=20
certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =
in=20
India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20
protests=20
against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20
Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=
e=20
suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations=
.=20
Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000
 to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures.

The Upside
With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20
competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=
ve=20
the entire=20
market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20
expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=
=20
get a=20
boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=
=20
AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via
 the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=
a=20
ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of=
=20
its strengths.=20
So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=
=20
AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.

The Downside
The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=
=20
Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and
 Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=
=20
last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=
=20
very=20
slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor=
e=20
2004.

Who Needs It?
Enron's mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most=
=20
conservative investors. Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it =
a=20
stable source of cash flow, while its new Internet-based ventures give it t=
he=20
great growth potential of a tech stock.

We've got a 2-deep OL lineup for next year but I question the quality as only 
a few were legit blue-chips and I like the odds of getting bluechips versus 
sleepers.  I think we'll get one of the 2 studs and maybe both.  The main 
concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of 
dominate line play.  We've got the skill guys, DB's and LB's.

No, did you?

Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news:

HOUSTON, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN - news) today 
announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted
 fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share. In addition, 
the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper range of 
current 
estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30 
percent.

Loftus,

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate 
what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get 
you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

Thanks,

Charlie

Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward

Your welcome and thank you - we were glad you could make it.  After you'll
left Elizabeth said "Mama, I thought you said Melissa had a baby in her
stomach."  She also wanted to know when they were going to cut it out.
Anyway, the Mardi Gras parades I wanted you'll to go to are on February 17th
at noon and at 6:00.  If you go to www.mardigrasgalveston.com you can see all
of the events.  We would really like it if you'll came - the kids always
enjoy jumping for the beads - the adults do too.  Let Stacey and Russell know
that they are welcome too.  Love, Margaret

Todd,

Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get 
exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a 
genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more 
time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we 
need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.


Thanks,

Charlie

I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not 
totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.

Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time.

Charlie,  Let me know whether or not you got my email yesterday about
Mardi Gras.  Our system was on the blink so I'm not sure if you received
it.  I hope Melissa is feeling better - Jimmy was up all night throwing
up and having cold chills.  Love, Margaret

FYI - Attached is a quote from a recent TWC memo that should be of interest 
given our recent conversations....

"December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity."

This is a section from an internal TWC memorandum - it looks like Q4 might 
make up for the quiet tropical season as far as their profits are concerned...

WEATHER CHANNEL EARNS HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY DECEMBER IN ITS HISTORY
Coverage of last month's "Winter Blitz"  brought The Weather Channel the
highest ratings for any December in its 18-year history and shattered
weather.com's previous December page view records. December 2000 was the
third highest-rated month ever. The Blizzard of '96 gave TWC its highest
ratings, followed by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999.
 Among the many recording-breaking weather events reported by TWC last month
were the snowiest weather ever in at least 12 cities and the coldest weather
on record in many places, including Louisville, Ky.
December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity.
TWC's coverage of the year-end Nor'easter that blanketed New York City with
over a foot of snow achieved a 0.870 rating, delivering 679,000 households
across the country on Saturday, December 30 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.).  The top
quarter hour occurred at 10 a.m. with a rating of 2.279 reaching 1.8 million
households.  The weekend rating for Dec. 30-31 was 0.753,  representing over
a half million households tuned in at any given time, according to Nielsen
data.  This was the second highest-rated weekend in 2000 and the sixth
highest-rated weekend in TWC's history.
Consumers also turned to weather.com in record numbers. By the close of
December, weather.com delivered more than 429 million total page views,
which is 67 percent higher than the previous monthly record, and 232 percent
higher than December 1999.  At its peak, weather.com delivered a record 27.8
million page views in a single day.  More than 1.3 million Unique Visitors
frequented weather.com  per day during the two weeks prior to Christmas,
according to Media Metrix.
The average TWC rating (6 a.m.-6 a.m.) from Dec.16-31 was 0.598, delivering
an average of 464,000 households, according to Nielsen. This was 85 percent
higher than the average rating for the same two-week period the year before.
The Weather Channel's coverage of sustained winter activity, which included
a Chicago blizzard on Dec. 10-11, brought the network its highest-rated
December ever.  TWC achieved a December rating of 0.462 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.),
delivering an average of 360,000 households.
