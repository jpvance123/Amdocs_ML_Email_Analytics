	Another bit of positive news. It's easier to start at the bottom of the e-mail and read up.
	George, do we have any intelligence on the Carbontronics deal?

Gail:

Please see below.  We've been after Sempra for some time to produce info re
Sempra Energy's other Section 29 deals, and they have seemed "reluctant" to
produce the info.  I can understand why.  It's a little difficult to argue
that crushing coal disables you from getting tax credits when your corporate
parent is claiming tax credits from precisely that kind of operation.

I'll let you know as soon as we finally get the Carbontronics production out
of Sempra.

Chris,

	Sempra holds its interest in Carbontronics through Sempra Energy
Financial Corporation, its unregulated investment subsidiary.  

	I have lost track of what the projects are doing, but when they were
originally put in service in 1998, the plan was to use as feedstock
"high-moisture, low-sulfur, low-Btu sub-bituminous coal" at two of the
projects, and a mix of coal fines or waste coal blended with whole coal at
the other two -- at least that's what we told the IRS in the ruling
requests.  The IRS ruling allows whole coal.  It says nothing about any size
limit.

Keith,

You mention below that Sempra wants to sell its interest in Carbontronics.
We learned in April that Sempra itself (as opposed to Sempra's subsidiaries)
has a direct syncoal investment, but we have been trying since then to get
Sempra to identify it for us.  I am assuming Carbontronics is it.  You have
previously described that project as a "crush and glue" project, which would
be a good thing for us, since that is what Sempra's sub is asserting does
not qualify for tax credits.  Do you have any other info re Carbontronics'
operations or Sempra's investment in it?

Thanks,

Greg and Chris,

	As best we can tell, Sempra is not in a position currently to use
section 29 tax credits.  This is based on the following bits of evidence.

	1. A company cannot claim section 29 tax credits in years when it
pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax (rather than
the regular corporate income tax).  

	2. Section 29 credits cannot be carried forward.  A company must use
them or lose them.  The one exception is in a year when the company is on
the alternative minimum tax, the credit turns into a so-called AMT credit
and can be carried forward.  It must be used in that case in the first year
the company comes off the AMT.

	3. It appears from Sempra's 10-K that it was in a net operating loss
position in 2000.  The company shows "current" federal income taxes of -$8
million.  It also shows "deferred" federal income taxes last year of $207
million.  According to Morris Meltzer, tax director at PG&E's unregulated
affiliate, this means that the company had more book income than taxable
income last year.  The deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company
expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity.

	4. Sempra's 10-Q for the first quarter 2001 shows positive current
tax liability of $74 million.  However, Jack Casey, vice chairman of
Meridian Investments, told me that Sempra expects to be in a net operating
loss position for the year.  Meridian has been hired by Sempra to sell
Sempra's interest in the Carbonronics syncoal facilities.  I asked Casey why
Sempra wants to sell -- is it because it can't use the tax credits or
because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad
publicity?  Casey said it cannot use the tax credits.

	In other news, the IRS has not budged on its plan to limit the
capacity of plants to which it issues rulings to absurdly low numbers.  The
industry has complained to the Treasury, and there have been discussions at
senior levels of Treasury and the IRS, but no reports back on where these
internal talks are headed.

	Detroit Edison has a meeting with the IRS on its ruling request next
Tuesday.  The IRS has said it will limit capacity at the DTE facility to
198,000 tons a year.

	I assume you saw the article last Thursday in the Wall Street
Journal about syncoal projects.  It was on the front page.  As far as I can
tell, all proposed sales of syncoal plants in the market are on hold.  This
is a consequence of the Wall Street Journal article and the impasse with the
IRS over capacity.  The industry is starting to think it may have won a
political battle earlier this year at Treasury, but lost the war.  The IRS
bureaucrats will have the final say.

	Joe Makurath, the IRS rulings group chief, said he is getting a
number of FOIA requests for documents about projects on which the IRS has
already ruled.  He said he intends to be liberal in releasing information.
There are rumors that the Wall Street Journal may be one of the
organizations seeking information and may be at work on a followup article.

	The IRS launched an audit of four projects in West Virginia and
Virginia that many people consider to be on the best end of the spectrum.
The projects already have rulings that they qualify for credits.  The IRS
appears to be gathering evidence to argue that they did not get into service
in time to qualify for tax credits or else that the projects failed to
comply with the rulings.  It is sending out big guns from Chicago, and one
agent told the taxpayer that the IRS national office said "don't worry about
expense on this one."

	I will try over the weekend to give you my comments on the
deposition transcripts.  Sorry for the delay.  If you don't find them when
you come in on Monday, they will be first on my to-do list that morning.

Keith

	I don't think the depo did any real damage. In any event, it's a good time for an update. 
	My assistant has set a tentative meeting for Wednesday at 3:30 pm.  We will confirm with Greg Markel and George and keep you posted.  In the meantime, please call with any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: Tom McQuade's Deposition


Greg:

Tom McQuade's deposition was an adventure.  I spent all day Monday prepping
him and I could not get him to say a word.  When I asked him about the
issues re Massey, he said he remembers talking to Massey, but he didn't
discuss buying 3/4" coal from Massey; McQuade said that his focus was on
selling the 3/4" synfuel output and that Matt Arnold must have had the
discussions with Massey re buying 3/4" coal.  Massey had an internal memo
saying that McQuade referenced a need for a 3/4" top size because of
Sempra's PLR, but McQuade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about the
PLR, never discussed 3/4" in the context of coal (as opposed to synfuel),
and said that Matt must have had those discussions.  In short, based on the
fact that McQuade wouldn't talk to me, I figured this depo would be a
breeze.

When we got to the depo, however, McQuade became "Chatty Cathy."  He had the
opportunity to take use one word answers, but he routinely felt a need to
expound.  For the most part, it didn't matter, because Jonathan Siegel was
taking the depo and was getting nowhere.  I kept reminding McQuade during
breaks to answer and shut up, and he kept acknowledging that that was what
he would do.  Once we resumed the depo, however, he kept falling back into
his habit of saying too much.  In the afternoon, I cut him off at points:
"You've answered that question.  Now wait for the next one."

More importantly, McQuade's testimony regarding Massey began to sound
evasive to me.  He was looking back and forth at the internal Massey
correspondence as if a light had gone off in his head, but was still saying
that he didn't discuss purchasing coal.  The Massey stuff is not a big issue
in the case, and I started fearing that McQuade's testimony would make it
one -- e.g., they read in the Massey depo, read parts of McQuade and then
say that McQuade lied about it.  McQuade had one other big screw-up: after
testifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within 2x0
coal, McQuade said near the end of the day that he told someone in Enron in
November that 2x0 has 30-35% 2x3/4 coal.

During a break late in the afternoon, I asked McQuade what happened with the
Massey testimony.  He said that, after seeing again the internal Massey memo
(written by a guy McQuade knows and trusts) saying that McQuade referenced a
PLR and a 3/4" top size, he began to believe that he MUST have said that to
the Massey guy.  I asked McQuade what he recalled about it.  He said that he
really didn't recall anything other than that he might have referenced size.
He still didn't think he referenced a PLR.  He then told me that the meeting
referenced in the memo was a dinner meeting, he'd had a few drinks, etc.  I
then asked McQuade about the size distribution testimony.  I suggested to
him that 30-35% might be the an outside limit of 2x3/4 coal in 2x0, and
McQuade agreed.

Based upon the foregoing, I asked McQuade just a handful of questions when
Siegel finished (it was 6:20; we started at 9:30).  I think it is the first
time I ever asked clean-up questions of my own witness, but I didn't want
this testimony to stand as it was, and I was sure that I would not want
McQuade at trial to clean it up then.  The size distribution testimony went
smoothly.  McQuade reiterated his testimony from earlier in the day re the
many factors that affect the size distribution within 2x0 and that, because
of those factors, there can be no standard distribution.  I then asked what
he meant when he gave the 30-35% testimony; he said that that was the upper
limit, and that it was by no means a standard.  Enough said on the issue, I
dropped it.

Re Massey, I directed McQuade's attention to the internal Massey memo and
asked whether it refreshed his recollection about discussing coal size with
Massey.  McQuade said that, because he knows the author of the memo, if the
author says McQuade referenced coal size, McQuade must have done so.
McQuade then said that he still doesn't recall any details whatsoever about
the discussion, having had drinks over dinner, etc.  He also testified that,
notwithstanding the reference to a PLR in the memo, he still didn't think he
referenced a PLR because McQuade doesn't think he even knew about a PLR.
McQuade surmised that the Massey guy might have just been assuming that a
PLR was involved.

Siegel then tried to question McQuade again about the Massey meeting, but he
did nothing but screw up the record.  McQuade, for example, testified for
the first time (Siegel hadn't asked before) that he'd actually had 2
meetings with Massey, the second one being with Matt Arnold and Kevin
McGowan.   While Siegel was questioning, I started packing up my things as a
reminder to Siegel that McQuade had a flight to catch.  Siegel "took the
bait" and, after muddying up the record some more, he decided to terminate
the deposition rather than keep McQuade there to learn about his new
recollection.  Siegel said he had no further questions and McQuade and I
were out of the building in seconds.

Bottom line: McQuade was a below average to bad witness, but he ultimately
didn't damage our record.   Because Mel will likely come back at Matt Arnold
about the Massey meetings in an effort to clean up what Siegel left so
muddy, we should be prepared for that.

Gail:
Attached is my analysis of Sempra's evidence on liability.  I think this is more than what you had in mind, but, once I started laying out particular pieces of evidence, I thought you and I (and probably Richard Sanders and others) would be better served if I analyzed the evidence in some depth.  I apologize for its length, but I think you will find it useful.
Please note in particular footnote 2.  I think I have figured out what
Sempra will identify as the ambiguity that requires the denial of our
liability motion and the introduction of parol evidence.  In short, the 
contract may not be airtight on our most important liability issue.
Finally, I think you should limit the people with whom you share this letter.  I tried to be as objective as I could on this, and some of my analysis/critique might not be welcomed by all readers (e.g., Braverman and Golias, and thus, Bruce Americus, too).  If you want to distribute this beyond your superiors, I might want to tone down some statements. 
<<919 Letter to Brownfeld.DOC>> 
Please give me a call after you've read it.  I'll get you the other deliverables (particularly including the damage analysis) to you shortly.
By the way, Happy New Year!  I've been wishing over the past few days that I was Jewish, so I could say that the events of last week occurred last year, and that I am already operating on a clean slate.  As it is, Christopher Paul Irish Catholic has to wait until December 31!!  Jeeeez!!

Subject: RE: synfuel marketing info


I'm writing to follow up on my last email regarding synfuel sales.  We are
on a tight deadline and need to know or at least be aware of the field of
documents that Enron may have, by Tues., concerning synfuel sales.  We need
documents concerning:

1) our efforts to market or sell synfuel (term sheets, contracts, e-mail
conversations, etc.);

2) all parties with whom we've had contact regarding efforts to sell or
market synfuel, and specifically, documents that reveal customers or
potential customers; and

3) customers' permits for the use of synfuel.

I spoke with Matt, who told me that the seller is not responsible for
checking or maintaining customers' permits, so we should focus on #s 1 & 2
above.  We have a few emails and other documents that you have already
produced to us as part of your email dumps to us, so you don't need to
reproduce those, but it seems as though Sam Grossman and Scott Pack at
minimum may have responsive documents.  Any term sheets or documents
generated from specific dealings with them that you may have would also be
helpful.  On this point, would someone please give me Sam Grossman's and
Scott Pack's phone numbers so I can contact them about documents they may
have.

We will also need copies of these documents, by Friday if possible.

Thank you.

Subject: RE: synfuel marketing info


With respect to plaintiffs' latest request for documents, did we take any
steps, create a plan, or attempt to market or sell Synthetic Fuel that was
to be produced by the Facilities?

Matt mentioned Sam Grossman's marketing materials, is there anything else
that we possess that may be construed as a plan or attempt to market or sell
synfuel?

Also, plaintiffs asked about documents relating to customers' permits for
the use of Synthetic Fuel.  Does a synfuel seller have to keep or otherwise
verify its customers' permits?

of course the answer is that we could have sold it in europe.  we should

Tony Bezanson is the guy who would have kept control of inventory etc at
Pier IX on our behalf.  I'm not sure who Blaine Pickens is.

Given the tenor of Sempra recent requests it seems they will try to hit us
on the synfuel marketing side - sort of we failed to perform because we
couldn't sell the stuff anyways.

Gail,

Attached are general summaries for Mooza, Cahill, Reagan, Smith, McQuade,
Beaury and McArdle.  As I stated, there's nothing for Wojtowicz but you can
speak to Chris about any specifics.

We're having a true digest done of McClellan . . . and Reck and McGowan.

=09I spoke with George today about whether Enron would be amenable to discu=
ssing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a "going=
 forward" basis while continuing the fight over past breaches. George said =
that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following =
general caveats: (1) We would like the facilities moved to one of the sites=
 we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient fo=
r us, and (2) we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to r=
eflect today's market situation. For example, the current risk apportionmen=
t and price would have to be modified.
=09With that in mind, do you have any thoughts about the most effective way=
 to facilitate these discussions?  The last settlement effort was pretty us=
eless and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting=
 opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background look=
ing for cover. What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a t=
hird party involved? In the alternative, would it be a good idea to involve=
 you and Mel?=20
=09On a slightly related note, I agree that we probably need to get a mitig=
ation letter out but I don't necessarily want to send the one we had been d=
iscussing.  Perhaps something that makes clear that they have a continuing =
duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to resolve thin=
gs?  Can you take a shot at it and get back to me? Thanks in advance.

Cc:=09Sanders, Richard
Subject:=09Sempra Litigation/Conversation with Michael Goldstein

=09Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in ligh=
t of the Rev. Proc. and its recent amendment.  After apologizing for being =
tardy in returning my calls, he explained that, in his opinion, the tax adv=
ice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situat=
ion.  First, he stated that he has been advised that the Rev. Proc. does no=
t apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make chang=
es going forward, it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior=
 to its issuance and, therefore, has no impact on whether synfuel created b=
efore the Rev. Proc. qualifies for the tax credit.
=09He also noted that, to determine the capacity issue, one needs to look a=
t what could have been produced by the facilities as of the "in- service" d=
ate. This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced. Acco=
rding to Goldstein, the level of production at Somerset was well below the =
capacity on the "in-service" date and, therefore, their proposed modificati=
ons to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inco=
nsistent with the intent of the Rev. Proc.  When asked what he believed to =
be the rated capacity of the facilities on their "in-service" date, Michael=
 didn't know.  He has agreed to find this number and get back to me.
=09After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev. Proc., Mich=
ael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford (sp?) at VE =
who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with=
 Section 29 and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Departmen=
t about it.  I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I di=
dn't know if this fellow was one of them.  He said that he had not talked t=
o Price and had no idea what he would advise.
=09Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev. Proc. wou=
ld serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order t=
o mitigate damages.  He stated further that he was actually looking forward=
 to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and, even, moving the second=
 machine back to Virginia.  When asked what was happening with the machine =
at Pier IX, he indicated that it remains idle because they can't get a sour=
ce of coal for it. I told Goldstein that I would visit with the "Coal Guys"=
 about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in l=
ight of everything that has happened.  He said that he didn't think this wa=
s going to be a problem since once things were up and running, there wouldn=
't be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a p=
roblem.  I suggested that if there was a way forward, we needed to make sur=
e the parties were on the same page about the Production Test, coal size, e=
tc. and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues =
arise during the course of performance. I think that Sempra is amenable to =
an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a me=
diation or something extraordinary, we will end up fighting about November =
through the date of any deal going forward. Please note that I made clear t=
hat I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra o=
n this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire.  I told him my=
 personal view was that, no matter how strong we felt our case was, I would=
 always listen to a settlement plan if they had one.
=09Finally, I told him I'd get with you guys and call him later today or to=
morrow so that he'd know whether it was worth having any additional discuss=
ions. Please give me call when you get a chance.  It might be a good idea t=
o set up a call later this afternoon if you are available.

=09I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions=
, that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is co=
nsistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand t=
he implications of the ruling on these facilities.
=09Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially ce=
rtify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity i=
s unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev Pr=
oc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that=

 equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strong=

Subject:=09R.W. Beck Depos

Greg and Gail:

I've just completed the depositions of R.W. Beck, Sempra's independent
engineers on the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities.  Specifically, I deposed
Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning.
The testimony was generally unfavorable to us.  In particular, I think they
require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev. Proc.'s places
limits on Sempra's "lost tax credit" damage claim.

As you know, IRS Rev. Proc. 2001-30 stated that "a facility ... may be
relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential
components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the
relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location."  It
also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a ? 29 ruling is that
"[t]he treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure
that results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product, or the
taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not
significantly increase the production output of the facility over the
remainder of the period during which the ? 29 credit is allowable."  This
recent ruling from the IRS, of course, was inconsistent with Sempra's May
2000 PLR request, in which Richard Coston stated that "[a]nother consequenc=
e
of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the
briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical
change ....  Applying less pressure[s] causes two changes to occur in the
production process.  First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will
be in the form of a briquette.  Second, output capacity can be significantl=
y
increased."

We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the
capacity of the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities combined to 2,000,000
tons/year.  If one assumes 24 hour/day operation for 360 days/year, each
machine would need to have a 115 ton/hour capacity to reach this level.
Keith Martin told us that the "increase in capacity" under Rev. Proc.
2001-30 should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was
"placed in service" prior to July 1, 1998.  As I told you a couple of weeks
ago, the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from R.W. Beck that th=
e
Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were "placed in service" on June 30,
1998.  In those certificates, Beck "certified" a capacity for each machine
of 50 tons/hour, which, for the 2 machines, means a max of 876,000
tons/year.  I concluded from this that, because Sempra's proposal to
increase Blue Grass/Somerset capacity by reducing the "briquetting" of the
output had been rejected by Rev. Proc. 2001-30, Sempra would not be able to
claim tax credits above those that could be produced at 50 tons/hour, and
that its damage claim would, at the very least, be capped at that level.

Keith Platte (pronounced "Platty"), the lead engineer for Beck, and the guy
who signed the certification, poked a big hole in this conclusion.  Platte
is very personable (particularly for an engineer), appears to know his fiel=
d
very well and, in my estimation, would make an excellent witness for Sempra=
,
should he be called.  (Mel did not question Platte.)  Regarding capacity,
Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or
Enron facilities.  According to him, the Engineering, Procurement and
Construction ("EPC") contracts pursuant to which the facilities were
constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at 50
tons/hour.  Platte said that R.W. Beck's job was simply to certify that the
facilities had indeed been constructed by 6/30/98 in accordance with the EP=
C
contracts, meaning that, as of that date, the facilities had at least that
capacity.  Did they have a capacity of 75 tons/hour on 6/30/98?   He cannot
say, because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition.

I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility
cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of
equipment in that facility.  He generally agreed with this fact, and that a
"slow" piece of equipment could act as a "bottleneck."  I then tried to
establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment,
particularly the briquetter.  I got nowhere.  He fell back on the
proposition that, if he did not test it, he does not know the capacity
limits.  He said that, if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the
briquetter, I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer.  At the
conclusion of the deposition, I decided that that is what I would do.

I may still do that, but, after deposing Lance Hardesty today, I am less
confident that that would be a fruitful course of action.  Hardesty is not
nearly as good a witness as Platte; he has a kind of wimpy, limp-handshake,
dufus quality to him -- the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing wit=
h
a slide-rule when God was handing out personality.   Hardesty is, however, =
a
very knowledgeable engineer.  To cut to the chase, Hardesty 3 weeks ago
"re-certified" the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at
Somerset, using the original Somerset design (e.g., no screen before the
crusher, as it was designed at Norfolk).  Hardesty certified that the Blue
Grass facility had a capacity today of at least 105 tons/hour.  Most
significantly, I asked Hardesty -- who participated in the 6/30/98
certification -- to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from
June 1998 and to identify all the changes in facility components between
then and now.  There were not many, and he believes (Holmes will have to
confirm) that the significant components in the synfuel process -- the
mixer, the blender and the briquetter -- are all the same, albeit with some
modifications.  Thus, Sempra's argument will be that, if those components
were capable of producing 105 tons/hour in May 2001, they must have been
capable of doing so in June 1998, the date the facility was "placed in
service."

What about the modifications?  I asked Hardesty to identify all of them.
Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings
of the mixer were changed somewhat.  The blender also had replaced some
internal pieces that wore out due to normal use.  (These things do not soun=
d
significant to me, but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me
otherwise.)  The briquetter is a different story.  Hardesty had earlier
admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the thing=
s
that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette (think
of a piece of charcoal).  Because of significant operational problems in th=
e
summer of 1998 (they kept breaking), the briquetters had to be reconfigured
at the direction of the manufacturer (Komar Industries).  Upon the
completion of these modifications, the briquetter rolls could be adjusted t=
o
achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from 0.5" to 1".  (Believe it
or not, I know what this means.)  Hardesty said that, during his visit to
Somerset earlier this month, the briquetter was set at 0.5" spacing and the
facility demonstrated a capacity of 90 tons/hour.  He then ran a capacity
test at 0.75" spacing, and the facility demonstrated a capacity of 105
tons/hour.   I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June
1998 were achieved, and he said "Certain improvements were made to the chut=
e
feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process
so that the material would flow better, in avoiding plugging.  But in June
of '98, we never attempted any sort of a maximum test; we merely tested for
the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility."
We then walked through each of the "improvements."  In short, other than th=
e
changes to the briquetter, none of them struck me as the kind of thing that
would offend the IRS.

Focusing on the briquetter, I asked him why it had been set at 0.5".  He
said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the
briquetter had after the modifications were completed in 1998.  (We'll need
to confirm this.)  I asked him whether he ran a test at the full 1" spacing=
.
He did not.  According to Hardesty, "[w]e discussed it with Richard Holmes,
Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston.  And for conservatism with regards to
maintaining the IRS placed-in-service ruling, three-quarter inch was
selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar ...
size as we made on June 30 of 1998," and in roughly the same proportion of
briquettes to non-briquetted fines.  In other words, Sempra will argue to
the IRS that, while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity
in 6/98, it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev=
.
Proc. 2001-30.  Thus, Sempra's most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT
Coston's May 2000 statement that the increase in capacity comes at the
expense of briquetting.

Obviously, there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempra's
new argument holds water.  For example, how do they prove what the percent
of briquettes to non-briquetted fines was in June 1998?  Also, we should
inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer (we need to
retain one) so we can draw our own conclusions.  Finally, we will need to
grill Holmes on much of the foregoing, because he continues to be the perso=
n
with all the relevant knowledge.

In sum, while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony, they at
least give us the tools to re-work our analysis on the possibility of using
Rev. Proc. 2001-30 to limit Sempra's lost tax credit damages.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

        There were more developments the past few days in the syncoal area

that might interest you.

        As you know, the IRS plans to write the "capacity" of each syncoal

plant into any private letters rulings it issues in the future.  Plant

owners will be held to production at this level.

        I spoke to Joe Makurath this morning about a rumor that he plans to

hold one project that is seeking a ruling to a "capacity" of 198,000 tons a

year.  Makurath is the IRS branch chief for section 29 rulings.  The "rumor"

was actually a report by a tax lawyer for Detroit Edison that the IRS looked

at actual output at his client's plant in 1998 and derived the "capacity" of

the plant from this output.  The tax lawyer complained, but was told he

could "lump it."

        Makurath said the following:

        1. He has made no final decision about how to determine capacity.

        2. The IRS has issued only one ruling since the rulings window

reopened in April.  That was a ruling to someone who already had a ruling,

but who had merely changed the entity that owns the project.  The new ruling

does not specify the capacity of the project.  That's because there was no

change in process from when the earlier ruling was issued.  He regards a

change in feedstock as a change in process.

        3. The "capacity" will be the capacity of the facility when it went

into service in June 1998.

        4. He is still feeling his way on how to determine the capacity when

the facility went into service.  Actual output is merely an "interesting

fact."  Capacity is not the same thing as output.  Some people made

representations about capacity at the time.  It would be "strange" if a

facility that people thought was capable of producing "100 units in June

1998 is now able to produce 1,000 units."  That might call into question

whether the facility was in service in June 1998 because it was just

starting to ramp up.  (An old revenue ruling holds that a power plant was in

service when it was producing at 17% of capacity and ramping up steadily

from there.)

        There was another rumor today that the IRS has backed off somewhat

in the Detroit Edison case.  The taxpayer is hoping it can get a capacity of

two times nameplate.  The coalition of syncoal owners is gearing back up to

lobby Congress for help.

Subject: Sempra tax rate



Greg and Chris,

	As best we can tell, Sempra is not in a position currently to use
section 29 tax credits.  This is based on the following bits of evidence.

	1. A company cannot claim section 29 tax credits in years when it
pays no taxes or pays them under the alternative minimum tax (rather than
the regular corporate income tax).  

	2. Section 29 credits cannot be carried forward.  A company must use
them or lose them.  The one exception is in a year when the company is on
the alternative minimum tax, the credit turns into a so-called AMT credit
and can be carried forward.  It must be used in that case in the first year
the company comes off the AMT.

	3. It appears from Sempra's 10-K that it was in a net operating loss
position in 2000.  The company shows "current" federal income taxes of -$8
million.  It also shows "deferred" federal income taxes last year of $207
million.  According to Morris Meltzer, tax director at PG&E's unregulated
affiliate, this means that the company had more book income than taxable
income last year.  The deferred tax liability reflects the taxes the company
expects to have to pay in the future as a result of this disparity.

	4. Sempra's 10-Q for the first quarter 2001 shows positive current
tax liability of $74 million.  However, Jack Casey, vice chairman of
Meridian Investments, told me that Sempra expects to be in a net operating
loss position for the year.  Meridian has been hired by Sempra to sell
Sempra's interest in the Carbonronics syncoal facilities.  I asked Casey why
Sempra wants to sell -- is it because it can't use the tax credits or
because it has soured on investing in syncoal projects given all the bad
publicity?  Casey said it cannot use the tax credits.

	In other news, the IRS has not budged on its plan to limit the
capacity of plants to which it issues rulings to absurdly low numbers.  The
industry has complained to the Treasury, and there have been discussions at
senior levels of Treasury and the IRS, but no reports back on where these
internal talks are headed.

	Detroit Edison has a meeting with the IRS on its ruling request next
Tuesday.  The IRS has said it will limit capacity at the DTE facility to
198,000 tons a year.

	I assume you saw the article last Thursday in the Wall Street
Journal about syncoal projects.  It was on the front page.  As far as I can
tell, all proposed sales of syncoal plants in the market are on hold.  This
is a consequence of the Wall Street Journal article and the impasse with the
IRS over capacity.  The industry is starting to think it may have won a
political battle earlier this year at Treasury, but lost the war.  The IRS
bureaucrats will have the final say.

	Joe Makurath, the IRS rulings group chief, said he is getting a
number of FOIA requests for documents about projects on which the IRS has
already ruled.  He said he intends to be liberal in releasing information.
There are rumors that the Wall Street Journal may be one of the
organizations seeking information and may be at work on a followup article.

	The IRS launched an audit of four projects in West Virginia and
Virginia that many people consider to be on the best end of the spectrum.
The projects already have rulings that they qualify for credits.  The IRS
appears to be gathering evidence to argue that they did not get into service
in time to qualify for tax credits or else that the projects failed to
comply with the rulings.  It is sending out big guns from Chicago, and one
agent told the taxpayer that the IRS national office said "don't worry about
expense on this one."

	I will try over the weekend to give you my comments on the
deposition transcripts.  Sorry for the delay.  If you don't find them when
you come in on Monday, they will be first on my to-do list that morning.

Keith

	As I think you guys know, the Sempra case is currently set for trial on October 11, 2001.  Given this week's events,  we believe that the trial date may be pushed back a few weeks; however, the current wisdom is that any delay will be slight.
	In the event you get any questions from anyone about this case, I attach a short (by my wordy standards) summary of the facts and issues in dispute.
	In addition to what is mentioned in the attached summary,  please note that we have two motions for summary judgment pending. The first is a liability motion arguing that the contract is clear on its face and supports our definition of Delivery Point.  If granted, this motion would dispose of all of the plaintiffs' claims, result in a liability judgment in favor of Enron and leave only Enron's damages to be tried. The second motion for summary judgment argues that, because the plaintiffs never made a claim for the tax credits they allege to have lost and cannot prove that they would not have received them, even if Enron was in breach of the parties' agreement, then plaintiffs' damage claim is entirely speculative and must be denied. 
	Finally, despite a good bit of effort on our part, several meetings and a business  related settlement offer made to plaintiffs several months ago, the plaintiffs have never responded or made a counter proposal.
	Please let me know if there are any questions about the attached.  Thanks.

We need to assign a commercial employee to the Sempra litigation.  I want to 
officially inform everyone in this group that no one from my group (Sales and 
Trading) are either assigned or spending any time thinking about Sempra.  I 
am personally not spending any time on it.  This being said, I am very 
concerned about the management of this case and have no feeling of who is 
running the show.  I believe unless things change, we are placing $23.5 MM at 
risk and a good deal of the problem is due to management of this case 
(including direction, strategy, decision making).  Sending flaming e-mails to 
a leaderless effort is not going to get us anywhere.

Maybe we should have a meeting and get our heads out of our ass.

 Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of 
the Rev. Proc. and its recent amendment.  After apologizing for being tardy 
in returning my calls, he explained that, in his opinion, the tax advice that 
we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation.  
First, he stated that he has been advised that the Rev. Proc. does not apply 
retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going 
forward, it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its 
issuance and, therefore, has no impact on whether synfuel created before the 
Rev. Proc. qualifies for the tax credit.
 He also noted that, to determine the capacity issue, one needs to look at 
what could have been produced by the facilities as of the "in- service" date. 
This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced. According 
to Goldstein, the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity 
on the "in-service" date and, therefore, their proposed modifications to the 
facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with 
the intent of the Rev. Proc.  When asked what he believed to be the rated 
capacity of the facilities on their "in-service" date, Michael didn't know.  
He has agreed to find this number and get back to me.
 After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev. Proc., Michael 
kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford (sp?) at VE who he 
considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section 
29 and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Department about 
it.  I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I didn't know 
if this fellow was one of them.  He said that he had not talked to Price and 
had no idea what he would advise.
 Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev. Proc. would 
serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to 
mitigate damages.  He stated further that he was actually looking forward to 
teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and, even, moving the second 
machine back to Virginia.  When asked what was happening with the machine at 
Pier IX, he indicated that it remains idle because they can't get a source of 
coal for it. I told Goldstein that I would visit with the "Coal Guys" about 
whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of 
everything that has happened.  He said that he didn't think this was going to 
be a problem since once things were up and running, there wouldn't be much 
occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem.  I 
suggested that if there was a way forward, we needed to make sure the parties 
were on the same page about the Production Test, coal size, etc. and even 
suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during 
the course of performance. I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to 
reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a mediation or 
something extraordinary, we will end up fighting about November through the 
date of any deal going forward. Please note that I made clear that I had no 
idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra on this deal 
outside the courthouse but that I would inquire.  I told him my personal view 
was that, no matter how strong we felt our case was, I would always listen to 
a settlement plan if they had one.
 Finally, I told him I'd get with you guys and call him later today or 
tomorrow so that he'd know whether it was worth having any additional 
discussions. Please give me call when you get a chance.  It might be a good 
idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available.

 I spoke with George today about whether Enron would be amenable to 
discussing settlement with Sempra and putting the facilities to work on a 
"going forward" basis while continuing the fight over past breaches. George 
said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the 
following general caveats: (1) We would like the facilities moved to one of 
the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more 
convenient for us, and (2) we want to renegotiate certain portions of the 
contracts to reflect today's market situation. For example, the current risk 
apportionment and price would have to be modified.
 With that in mind, do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to 
facilitate these discussions?  The last settlement effort was pretty useless 
and I think we should try to avoid having Holmes and Gittomer sitting 
opposite from George and Wayne with Goldstein and I in the background looking 
for cover. What do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a third 
party involved? In the alternative, would it be a good idea to involve you 
and Mel? 
 On a slightly related note, I agree that we probably need to get a 
mitigation letter out but I don't necessarily want to send the one we had 
been discussing.  Perhaps something that makes clear that they have a 
continuing duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to 
resolve things?  Can you take a shot at it and get back to me? Thanks in 
advance.

 I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions, 
that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is 
consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand 
the implications of the ruling on these facilities.
 Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially 
certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity 
is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev 
Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that 
the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't 
mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have 
to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I 
don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive). 
 Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to 
talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M 
folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos. 
 On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several 
issues.  First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested 
in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.  I 
questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the 
equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strongly 
doubted that "repricing the deal" or "dramatically changing the economics" of 
the deal would be acceptable.  I also asked whether he thought a mediation 
would be acceptable.  In response, he indicated that although he wouldn't 
rule it out, he thought it was premature. Finally, I mentioned that there had 
been some talk of deposing him.  He said that his only involvement in the 
negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra 
and, therefore, these communications would be privileged.  He said he only 
met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this 
was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing 
other things. He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLR's. Let 
me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this. 
 Finally, George is still out of town but as soon as he returns, I'll get 
with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out. 
Thanks.

Subject: R.W. Beck Depos

Greg and Gail:

I've just completed the depositions of R.W. Beck, Sempra's independent
engineers on the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities.  Specifically, I deposed
Keith Platte all day Tuesday and deposed Lance Hardesty Wednesday morning.
The testimony was generally unfavorable to us.  In particular, I think they
require us to rethink our theory that the recent IRS Rev. Proc.'s places
limits on Sempra's "lost tax credit" damage claim.

As you know, IRS Rev. Proc. 2001-30 stated that "a facility ... may be
relocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essential
components of the facility are retained and the production capacity of the
relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location."  It
also stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a o 29 ruling is that
"[t]he treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressure
that results in briquettes, pellets, or an extruded fuel product, or the
taxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will not
significantly increase the production output of the facility over the
remainder of the period during which the o 29 credit is allowable."  This
recent ruling from the IRS, of course, was inconsistent with Sempra's May
2000 PLR request, in which Richard Coston stated that "[a]nother consequence
of the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in the
briquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemical
change ....  Applying less pressure[s] causes two changes to occur in the
production process.  First a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel will
be in the form of a briquette.  Second, output capacity can be significantly
increased."

We know from the Enron agreements that Sempra sought to increase the
capacity of the Blue Grass/Somerset facilities combined to 2,000,000
tons/year.  If one assumes 24 hour/day operation for 360 days/year, each
machine would need to have a 115 ton/hour capacity to reach this level.
Keith Martin told us that the "increase in capacity" under Rev. Proc.
2001-30 should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it was
"placed in service" prior to July 1, 1998.  As I told you a couple of weeks
ago, the Sempra Offering Memo contains a certificate from R.W. Beck that the
Blue Grass and Somerset facilities were "placed in service" on June 30,
1998.  In those certificates, Beck "certified" a capacity for each machine
of 50 tons/hour, which, for the 2 machines, means a max of 876,000
tons/year.  I concluded from this that, because Sempra's proposal to
increase Blue Grass/Somerset capacity by reducing the "briquetting" of the
output had been rejected by Rev. Proc. 2001-30, Sempra would not be able to
claim tax credits above those that could be produced at 50 tons/hour, and
that its damage claim would, at the very least, be capped at that level.

Keith Platte (pronounced "Platty"), the lead engineer for Beck, and the guy
who signed the certification, poked a big hole in this conclusion.  Platte
is very personable (particularly for an engineer), appears to know his field
very well and, in my estimation, would make an excellent witness for Sempra,
should he be called.  (Mel did not question Platte.)  Regarding capacity,
Platte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the Blue Grass or
Enron facilities.  According to him, the Engineering, Procurement and
Construction ("EPC") contracts pursuant to which the facilities were
constructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at 50
tons/hour.  Platte said that R.W. Beck's job was simply to certify that the
facilities had indeed been constructed by 6/30/98 in accordance with the EPC
contracts, meaning that, as of that date, the facilities had at least that
capacity.  Did they have a capacity of 75 tons/hour on 6/30/98?   He cannot
say, because he was not asked to and did not test that proposition.

I spent some time with Platte establishing that the capacity of a facility
cannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece of
equipment in that facility.  He generally agreed with this fact, and that a
"slow" piece of equipment could act as a "bottleneck."  I then tried to
establish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipment,
particularly the briquetter.  I got nowhere.  He fell back on the
proposition that, if he did not test it, he does not know the capacity
limits.  He said that, if I wanted to know the capacity limit of the
briquetter, I needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer.  At the
conclusion of the deposition, I decided that that is what I would do.

I may still do that, but, after deposing Lance Hardesty today, I am less
confident that that would be a fruitful course of action.  Hardesty is not
nearly as good a witness as Platte; he has a kind of wimpy, limp-handshake,
dufus quality to him -- the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing with
a slide-rule when God was handing out personality.   Hardesty is, however, a
very knowledgeable engineer.  To cut to the chase, Hardesty 3 weeks ago
"re-certified" the Blue Grass facility as it had been reconstructed back at
Somerset, using the original Somerset design (e.g., no screen before the
crusher, as it was designed at Norfolk).  Hardesty certified that the Blue
Grass facility had a capacity today of at least 105 tons/hour.  Most
significantly, I asked Hardesty -- who participated in the 6/30/98
certification -- to walk through an engineering plan of the facility from
June 1998 and to identify all the changes in facility components between
then and now.  There were not many, and he believes (Holmes will have to
confirm) that the significant components in the synfuel process -- the
mixer, the blender and the briquetter -- are all the same, albeit with some
modifications.  Thus, Sempra's argument will be that, if those components
were capable of producing 105 tons/hour in May 2001, they must have been
capable of doing so in June 1998, the date the facility was "placed in
service."

What about the modifications?  I asked Hardesty to identify all of them.
Holmes and Frank Ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workings
of the mixer were changed somewhat.  The blender also had replaced some
internal pieces that wore out due to normal use.  (These things do not sound
significant to me, but an engineer or Keith Martin could convince me
otherwise.)  The briquetter is a different story.  Hardesty had earlier
admitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the things
that can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette (think
of a piece of charcoal).  Because of significant operational problems in the
summer of 1998 (they kept breaking), the briquetters had to be reconfigured
at the direction of the manufacturer (Komar Industries).  Upon the
completion of these modifications, the briquetter rolls could be adjusted to
achieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from 0.5" to 1".  (Believe it
or not, I know what this means.)  Hardesty said that, during his visit to
Somerset earlier this month, the briquetter was set at 0.5" spacing and the
facility demonstrated a capacity of 90 tons/hour.  He then ran a capacity
test at 0.75" spacing, and the facility demonstrated a capacity of 105
tons/hour.   I asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in June
1998 were achieved, and he said "Certain improvements were made to the chute
feeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the process
so that the material would flow better, in avoiding plugging.  But in June
of '98, we never attempted any sort of a maximum test; we merely tested for
the minimum EPC requirements of the EPC contract to install the facility."
We then walked through each of the "improvements."  In short, other than the
changes to the briquetter, none of them struck me as the kind of thing that
would offend the IRS.

Focusing on the briquetter, I asked him why it had been set at 0.5".  He
said that he was told by Holmes and Ikerd that that was the setting the
briquetter had after the modifications were completed in 1998.  (We'll need
to confirm this.)  I asked him whether he ran a test at the full 1" spacing.
He did not.  According to Hardesty, "[w]e discussed it with Richard Holmes,
Frank Ikerd and Richard Coston.  And for conservatism with regards to
maintaining the IRS placed-in-service ruling, three-quarter inch was
selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar ...
size as we made on June 30 of 1998," and in roughly the same proportion of
briquettes to non-briquetted fines.  In other words, Sempra will argue to
the IRS that, while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity
in 6/98, it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of Rev.
Proc. 2001-30.  Thus, Sempra's most recent PLR request will likely RETRACT
Coston's May 2000 statement that the increase in capacity comes at the
expense of briquetting.

Obviously, there is still some factual work to be done to see if Sempra's
new argument holds water.  For example, how do they prove what the percent
of briquettes to non-briquetted fines was in June 1998?  Also, we should
inspect the new facility at Somerset with our own engineer (we need to
retain one) so we can draw our own conclusions.  Finally, we will need to
grill Holmes on much of the foregoing, because he continues to be the person
with all the relevant knowledge.

In sum, while the Beck depositions did not generate good testimony, they at
least give us the tools to re-work our analysis on the possibility of using
Rev. Proc. 2001-30 to limit Sempra's lost tax credit damages.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
