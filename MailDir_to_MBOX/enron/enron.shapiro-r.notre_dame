Rick --

Please find attached the asset report in Texas.  Enron's ownership depends on what day the filing is made (for instance, Indian Mesa won't be active until Dec and may be sold immediately).

Also, there is an on-going arbitration with Cornhusker about our ownership right.  Andy Edison has the lead from EWS legal.

Subject:	FW:  Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call




The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

THE MARKETS
Suitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.
By ALEX BERENSON

11/13/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Wall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy's $9 billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday. 
Three days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company's profits. They met a receptive audience.
Dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since last Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy's stock has risen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. 
After some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted Dynegy's view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. Enron's stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. 
But Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enron's problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations. 
''There's nothing wrong with Enron's business,'' Mr. Watson said in an interview at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors. ''The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.'' 
Enron's immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron's business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bolster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential investments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. 
Mr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron's shares plunged. ''Right now, there's some animosity over there,'' he said. 
Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice. 
Mr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy's earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. 
Analysts backed that view yesterday. ''Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,'' said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price. 
''It's not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,'' he said. ''My guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.'' 
The deal could increase Dynegy's earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group. 
''That's a whopper,'' he said. ''It's a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.'' 
Mr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of ''the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.'' 
''We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,'' he said. ''A good company was being badly tarnished.''

Today's best post award (1 share of ENE - just kidding!!) goes to RRocketfan.

Repeated below:

Sung to "Those were the Days" from All in the Family...

Only hung with wealthy friends
Had the new Mercedes Benz
Means were justified by ends
Those were the days

Andy Fastow's Porsche was neat
With LJM it's off the balance sheet
We sure were loved by the Street
Those were the days

And you knew who you were then
Down the hall, my new girlfriend
Brother we could use a man like Jeffrey Skilling again

Didn't need no SEC
All my calls deep in money
Used to drink with Delaney

As the merger between Dynegy & Enron goes through, any calls received requesting documentation or information regarding the merger should be relayed to me. I will be the point of contact for all Dynegy/Enron information requests.

I have done extensive CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) work with Jackson in connection with the passage of Financial Services Modernization.  This will be tricky.

Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy deal. 
The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houston-based energy firms. 
"Dynegy needs our participation to get approval," Jackson said Monday. 
The organization's interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and EEOC rulings. 
Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown. 
Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum. 
Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said. 
The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said. 
Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau chief here. 
The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year. 
Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level management and contracts, Jackson said. 
Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax. 
He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars. 
"It must be bottom up," Jackson said. 
One-third of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers, worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months. 
This would help employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season, he said.

Rick,

Here was the last analysis done in early October.  I do not believe the term curve has changed much in the last month, so it is still current.

Tim asked me to forward this to West Desk traders.  Prepared by Mo Elafandi and Heather Dunton, it showsw who's in the money with DWR at this point, based on executed contracts

Rick - We are disseminating the press release around to our contacts at the
legislative level. Will be starting the high level contacts soon. Given
that FERC filing will not be made until 12/31, did not view this as
necessarily a pre-Thanksgiving item.

Andy --

I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  

This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  

I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.

Thanks,

Jim

Rick - 

Dynegy filed at FERC to protest Com Ed's practice of letting Firm LD ("marketer or financial firm") power qualify as a network resource and therefore be used by marketers for retail contracts.   Dynegy says this deprives them of capacity payments that they are entitled to and threatens reliability because adequate reserve margin is not being carried to serve retail load.  Dynegy believes retail load must be satisfied using Physical Firm products where specific generation is tied to the retail contract.  New Energy and Cilco are the marketers directly implicated.

Enron, Cilco, New Energy, and the ICC have all intervened in support of Com Ed's practice.  Our complaint (Susan Lindberg was author) says financial firm is sufficiently, and perhaps even more, reliable than physical firm; and says Dynegy's proposal in effect would create an unneeded ICAP market.  The ICC goes on to say Dynegy's proposal would impair retail competition by discouraging entry into the retail market. 

Here is the Enron filing -

 
The other case involving IP is the retail rate case where we have intervened to have IP's request for higher delivery rates dismissed.  Our argument is the legal one that their proposal favors bundled customers over unbundled customers.  It's the same argument we made in a similar Com Ed case.

I will be there and will bring all the information that we need. I manage Government Affairs on a global basis, both regulatory and legislative. Thanks for your kind thoughts and words- I look forward to working with you during this transition and doing the best we can for our people and the combined company. Enjoy your weekend.

Congratulations to you also -- its going to be a great combination!!! I
would suggest getting together Tuesday morning at 8:30 am over here if that
works for you. If you have org charts, comp information  and budget info
that would facilitate the discussion.  We can get with Peter Esposito after
you and I meet.  I also need to review the Legislative shop (we are very
thin there) - if that function does not report to you I can get with Steve
Kean on that. Have a great weekend! Ken .

If Notre Dame is brought to closure( my hope is that it will), once that
occurs, I'd like to figure out with you, or whomever you deem
appropriate from Dynegy a couple of things: 1) We currently have 65
government affairs professionals at Enron around the globe( 55 in North
America, including the Washington office)..I anticipate making
significant job cuts early in the transition and would like to make sure
that the cuts are being done with the merged company fully in mind; 2)
As you have seen from our disclosures, we have many more regulatory
approvals associated with the Enron Assets as compared to Dynegy's- I'd
like to work with you or whomever you designate to determine  the most
efficient way to process these filings through to approval. My intent
with this e-mail is not to further burden the next couple of critical
days, but merely to raise the issues so we're in a position to talk and
meet soon thereafter. I think you will find in the government affairs
professionals here the same commitment to excellence and integrity which
characterizes the folks I've come into contact with at Dynegy. I'll wait
to hear from you. Good luck in the next few days.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Attached is a rough draft for our PUCT filing.  Initial review (subject to
check with Enron) is that the combined parties generation in the ERCOT
region will exceed the 1% review threshold but be far below the 20% action
level.  I roughed out the elements of a filing based on the Dynegy/Illinova
docket from two years ago.  I have a meeting scheduled with Chairman
Yzaguirre tomorrow afternoon--thought I might provide him with the table on
generation interests within ERCOT and alert him to the pending request.

I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

Kindly find a memorandum summarizing the credit worthiness parameters in the functioning ISOs in the US and Canada that was prepared by the Risk Analytics Group.  ERCOT is still outstanding and shall send you an update as soon as it is ready.

The seminal documents-in hard copies-- for this summary are also available at your request.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Please find attached the summary for credit worthiness for market participants in the five ISOs in the US (NYISO, NEPOOL, PJM, ERCOT, and CAISO), plus the two in Canada (Alberta and Ontario).  All the seminal documents to substantiate this report are also available centrally here at first request of any party.  
 

As per the advise of Alberto, I should have contacted you earlier last week to see if Houston could be of any help in compiling a similar resource for the UK, the Nordic Region, and Australia on similar lines to the report above.     If such report exists, kindly send a copy.

Robert,

Here is an updated sheet with EPMI physical transactions with deliveries in California.   The format has been improved and I added a breakout for transactions with Dynegy.  Please destroy earlier versions of this report.

Rick Shapiro has asked to be the point of contact in Government Affairs regarding the merger.  Please copy him on future communications.

Robert, or Rick: Please let me know if you need any help such as adding months, putting the data in another format, or combining this data with Dynegy market share data.

Alan Comnes

Rick --

We do have an on-going dispute with the PAPUC about our assessment for gas sales.  The charge is $150k.  We are suing with others the PAPUC to argue that we are not a utility and therefore can't get assessed.

The FERC denied Dynegy's petition for declaratory order by the Commission disclaiming the jurisdiction over the siting, construction and operation of the Hackberry, La. LNG facility. 

A copy of the order will be available later today for review.

I don't have the final budget back immediately to hand (Greg is out today).  It came out at $2.7 million (excluding Teun van Biert who we decided to keep).

Talk to you later (at 2pm your time).

1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC

Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year.

2.	MISO vs. ARTO

IP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year in Illinois.

3.	CTC Bet in ComEd

My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.

4.	Delivery Service Tariff Litigation

ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.

5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination

ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to "deliver" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?

6.	Relative Size of Current EES Book

ComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)
IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)

Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.

Jim

The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

NYISO Credit Policy
The NYISO has established the following creditworthiness policy to ensure that customer can meet its obligations and to protect against the risk of non-payment of invoices.  A summary of this policy is as follows:
1.	To assure credit worthiness, a NYISO customer may provide a cash deposit, an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (from an acceptable American or Canadian Bank with A credit rating from S&P, or A2 by Moody's), or obtain corporate guarantee from its parent company for all financial obligations under the tariffs; assuming that the parent company complies with credit ratings acceptable.  The amount of the instrument equals the sum of the customer's obligations to the NYISO for three months (the greatest over a rolling 12-month period).
2.	In lieu of cash deposits, letters of credit, or corporate guarantee, the customer must submit initially, and annually thereafter, a current debt-rating agency of a minimum of "BBB" or "Baa2" by SP, or Moody's respectively.  

3.	Any services provided under the Tariff may be terminated either immediately (for Service Tariffs) or upon 60 days prior notice (OATT) if the customer fails to demonstrate its creditworthiness.  
A NYISO customer must immediately inform the NYISO of any material change in its financial position.

If Notre Dame is brought to closure( my hope is that it will), once that
occurs, I'd like to figure out with you, or whomever you deem
appropriate from Dynegy a couple of things: 1) We currently have 65
government affairs professionals at Enron around the globe( 55 in North
America, including the Washington office)..I anticipate making
significant job cuts early in the transition and would like to make sure
that the cuts are being done with the merged company fully in mind; 2)
As you have seen from our disclosures, we have many more regulatory
approvals associated with the Enron Assets as compared to Dynegy's- I'd
like to work with you or whomever you designate to determine  the most
efficient way to process these filings through to approval. My intent
with this e-mail is not to further burden the next couple of critical
days, but merely to raise the issues so we're in a position to talk and
meet soon thereafter. I think you will find in the government affairs
professionals here the same commitment to excellence and integrity which
characterizes the folks I've come into contact with at Dynegy. I'll wait
to hear from you. Good luck in the next few days.

I expect that there will be pressing need to co-ordinate with Dynegy on our regulatory issues and approaches. I have already been contacted by the Federal Cartel Office and the Austrian Government on potential implications of the transaction. Some thoughts that have occured to me are:

1. Exchanging notes with our counterparts at Dynegy on current and pending regulatory issues/battles on the Continent.
2. Discussion of our respective approaches and development of a common regulatory strategy
3. Possible "road trip" to EU, regulatory authorities adn governments, to discuss the take-over and present the "new company"
4. Definite need to meet with DG Comp and the Merger Task Force assuming the transaction will also require EU approval. I am concerned here that many of the incumbents might see this as an opportunity to even the score for the blood we extracted in the past.
5. Possible meeting with Federal Cartel Office on same. Depending on market definitions, this could be subject to BkartA approval. (David Keane of Dynegy has already contact me about this and wants me to set up a joint meeting for Enron and Dynegy and the BkartA in 10 days time)

Rick and Paul - I will try and reach you later in the day on this.

Cheers, Paul

Thanks for the input.  Attached is the current version of the data to
support the PUCT filing.  I have had a couple conversations with Richard
Greffe of PUCT staff regarding the requirements of 25.401 and plan to walk
him thru the backup workpapers by the end of the month to get any
suggestions.  I did mention to Chairman Yzaguirre at a meeting earlier this
week that we might be bringing a filing to the Commission but that it was
just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two
Commissioners in meetings next week.  While we could possibly play with the
numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my
inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of
caution and to create good will.

The 11/1 e-mail (excerpt below) also notes that no event of default otherwise would occur, a fact specific inquiry; e.g., debt to cap ratio upon consummation of the merger:

Typical merger provisions provide that either (i) ENE survive or if not, (ii) 
the survivor be organized under U.S. (or state thereof) law, 
assume all obligations of ENE under the subject contract, and 
no event of default under the subject agreement would exist or result (whether an event of default would exist requires facts on a specific deal so covenants and other contract terms can be tested). 

To the extent that other groups reported to me differences from the typical provisions set forth above, I forwarded them onto to you.

Regards, NJD

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

I received revised financial information from our accountants late yesterday, which indicates that from Enron's perspective it will most likely be a EC (not a UK) filing, unless the EC referenced the matter back to any member states.  Linklaters and I are continuing to analyze this data, and I do not want to provide any notice of this to Dynegy until next week after we confirm the information.
 
I am out of the office today and will send you the OFT notice next week.
 
Robert

Dynegy and Enron
Announce Merger=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from Reuters] Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) agreed on Nov. 9 to acquir=
e rival Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) for some $9 billion in stock, underlining t=
he dramatic reversal of fortunes for the Houston-based energy trading giant=
 that was valued last year at nearly $80 billion. Enron's stock fell sharpl=
y in the past month due to investors' concerns about murky transactions tha=
t sparked an investigation by U.S. regulators and damaging downgrades by cr=
edit rating agencies. The merged company will retain the Dynegy name. It wi=
ll have annual revenues of more than $200 billion and assets worth $90 bill=
ion, including more than 22,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacit=
y and 25,000 miles of natural-gas pipelines. It will be North America's big=
gest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity, positions previous=
ly held by Enron.

Analysis: Well, it's now official. The announcement of what presumably will=
 be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the end o=
f last week. It is indeed a dramatic end. Enron, the maverick and innovativ=
e company that has often been credited for literally creating deregulated m=
arkets in the energy industry, will no longer exist after what has been a v=
ery quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several months. Dy=
negy, the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional approach=
 toward success, is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival and l=
ocking in much of the industry market share of Enron. Can there be any doub=
t that this is the energy industry's manifestation of the tortoise and the =
hare parable? Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy, but is making a sm=
art choice to be bought, considering its desperate circumstances and the un=
likelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own. For Dynegy, this=
 acquisition is a major win, as the combination will create the biggest and=
 strongest energy merchant in the world.=20

There are so many interesting dimensions to this mammoth deal. Before addre=
ssing some issues related to the approval of the deal, let's establish some=
 of the key points of the merger agreement. There have been some mixed repo=
rts, but it is generally believed that Dynegy is buying Enron for about $10=
 a share, quite a steal considering that just over a year ago Enron was tra=
ding at close to $90 a share and had a market value of nearly $70 billion. =
Under terms of the agreement, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 Dynegy=
 shares per share of Enron common stock. Dynegy's current stockholders (inc=
luding ChevronTexaco Corp., which currently owns 27 percent of Dynegy) will=
 own approximately 64 percent of the combined company, while Enron's stockh=
olders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company's stock at=
 closing.=20

In addition, Dynegy will provide an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equ=
ity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes=
, followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined comp=
any by ChevronTexaco. Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy, will retain=
 his position at the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, and=
 Rob Doty, chief financial officer, will retain their positions at the new =
company. It is not presently known what role, if any, Ken Lay, current CEO =
of Enron, will hold at the new company.=20

Of course, this acquisition could not have taken place if Enron had not fal=
len into a very vulnerable spot this year. Quite literally, Enron was pushe=
d into this deal because it was running out of cash, its stock had tanked a=
nd its credit ratings were slashed to near junk levels, all within the last=
 several weeks. Enron's decline over the course of 2001 has been the result=
 of losses in its telecom sector, losses from its involvement in India, the=
 departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission (SEC) investigation into some of its business practices, and lack =
of investor confidence about Enron's honesty in its financial reporting. Th=
is last point gained validity last week when Enron announced that it had ov=
erstated earnings by 20 percent over the last four years and investors shou=
ld disregard the company's financial statements from 1997 through the first=
 half of 2001. The restating of its earnings for the last five years sliced=
 $591 million from Enron's reported profits. In addition, Enron revised its=
 debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000. At the end of 2000, Enron's de=
bt was $10.86 billion, $628 million more than it had previously reported. B=
y not reporting this debt earlier, Enron presumably was able to maintain a =
stronger credit rating than it would have had the accurate records been dis=
closed.=20

The key value for Dynegy in this acquisition is Enron's successful energy t=
rading business. In addition, Dynegy could also find synergies in Enron's r=
etail unit, Enron Energy Services and EnronOnline, the company's electronic=
 trading unit. Dynegy has a similar trading site known as Dynegydirect, whi=
ch was launched after Enron gained the first-strike advantage in this marke=
t space. Details are still emerging, but it would make sense if Dynegy opte=
d to not purchase other units under Enron's business structure, such as the=
 company's water and telecom businesses, which are losing money. Dynegy has=
 its own telecom unit, which has also lost money this year, so it may not w=
ant to expand in this slow-growing sector at this time. Vivendi Environneme=
nt, a French company that has expanded into various lines of business, has =
reportedly expressed interest in the remaining subsidiaries of Azurix, Enro=
n's struggling water subsidiary. Note that Enron sold Azurix North America =
to American Water Works.=20

The deal is subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dyn=
egy and Enron shareholders. Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent u=
pon any possible downgrades on its long-term debt that Dynegy could encount=
er with the purchase of Enron. At this juncture, it does not appear that Dy=
negy will be downgraded, but this is a fast-changing story and conditions c=
ould change abruptly. Financing the deal may also be an issue, even with th=
e infusion of capital from ChevronTexaco. Dynegy reportedly has $3 billion =
worth of debt and has a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Thus, Enron=
's own more substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb, a=
 concern that may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal. This issue co=
uld be helped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enron's assets and =
if there is some repair work done on Enron's balance sheets.=20

The issue of regulatory approval could be difficult, as the combination of =
the two huge companies may cause regulators to be concerned about market po=
wer and antitrust issues. The review of this merger will be unprecedented, =
considering that the wholesale natural-gas and electricity trading market i=
s still fairly young. Certainly, a deal of this magnitude has not previousl=
y occurred in the deregulating energy industry. It is not presently clear w=
hich regulatory agency will be involved in the review, although the Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Federal Trade Commission and the =
Justice Department could all be involved. FERC would most likely become inv=
olved only if the acquisition includes the transfer of a physical asset, su=
ch as a pipeline. FERC may not become involved if the deal is structured so=
lely as an exchange of stock. Not involving FERC would be more advantageous=
 for Dynegy and Enron as the timeline for approval would be significantly s=
horter.=20

An issue that most likely will be at the top of the list of review items fo=
r regulators would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dyne=
gy would hold market power in the natural-gas trading space, which could pr=
e-empt market entry by other competitors. The combined company would be con=
siderably larger than its nearest competitors. Scope and scale are consider=
ed the top competitive assets in the trading sector, and the combination of=
 Dynegy and Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance. It will fa=
ll on regulators to determine if the combined company is so large that it p=
recludes other competitors from emerging into the same space.=20

To say that this deal is a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatem=
ent. The two rival companies followed very different paths to success. Enro=
n, under the leadership of Jeffrey Skilling in particular, espoused an unor=
thodox belief that the company did not need to own physical assets in order=
 to achieve success in the energy-trading space. Dynegy, on the other hand,=
 approached the market from the opposite perspective, and diligently acquir=
ed diverse generation assets across the United States and internationally t=
o support its trading operation. Up until the start of 2001, it appeared th=
at Enron's strategy was the more successful of the two. Enron, with $100 bi=
llion in revenues and $1 billion in profits in 2000, ranked fifth on Fortun=
e 500's list of largest U.S. companies. In contrast, Dynegy ranked 54 on th=
e same list and had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings. H=
owever, 2000 turned out to be Dynegy's year and the success continued into =
2001, the very year that would bring Enron's downfall. Enron's problems cul=
minated in $638 million in losses in the third quarter, after taking $1.01 =
billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. Take=
n with the other factors plaguing the company, Enron became exceptionally v=
ulnerable and prone to a takeover, which has now provided Dynegy with a str=
ong gain.=20

The purchase of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegy's size and should imm=
ediately provide an accretive earnings contribution. Further, Dynegy claims=
 that it expects a 15- to 20-percent annual earnings growth over the next t=
hree years following its planned acquisition of Enron. If it gains all of t=
he necessary regulatory approvals, Dynegy will become the undisputed market=
 leader in the energy industry, with annual revenues of $200 billion and $9=
0 billion in assets. The company will have 22,000 MW of generating capacity=
, which moves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating=
 70,000 MW by 2005. In other words, the combined company will dwarf any oth=
er competition in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its neare=
st competitors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size, resources an=
d assets.=20

Word of the acquisition caused Enron's shares to increase some, one of the =
few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months. S=
hares of Enron rose 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $8.85 in mid-day trade on =
the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. As of early morning trade on Nov. 12=
, Enron shares were priced at $9.40. Shares of Dynegy gained $2.24, or 5.8 =
percent, to $41 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.=20

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jim

Here are general answers to the issues we discussed:
     1)Provider of Last resort: IP retains an obligation to be the provider=
 of last resort(POLR) until the end of the transition period( which is the =
period during which stranded costs are recovered)....the transition period =
end 12/31/06. 2007 and beyond relative to POLR obligation is an unknown. Ho=
w IP will fill this obligation beyond 2004, when it's "clawback" contracts =
to IP's generation and Clinton expire is unknown...Dynegy should be able to=
 answer. Based on my review and understanding of the statute(restructuring)=
, Dynegy has little chance of a material risk developing relative to the PO=
LR obligation. 2) Stranded cost recovery: Competition Transition Charges or=
 stranded  costs are recoverable by IP through 12/31/06( Dynegy does have a=
n ROE cap through 2004...it is equal to the treasury bond yield plus 850 ba=
sis points). The level of transition charges varies periodically, as the ma=
rket price calculation varies( I can explain this later, but it is not part=
icularly important). Bottom line: IP has almost zero risk of achieving less=
 than 100% recovery of stranded costs.3) Distribution and Transmission  rat=
e risk: I won't go into any detail, but there is less risk of achieving les=
s than  a compensatory  on T&D assets in Illinois than in any other state i=
n the country. 4) California refund amount for Dynegy: Intuitively and base=
d on what I know, $530 million exposure should be West Coast Power's max ex=
posure, so roughly $265 million for Dynegy...but, I wouldn't take this to t=
he bank unless I fully understood the joint venture's documentation. 5)DWR =
renegotiation risk: Coming shortly under separate e-mail will be analysis o=
f DWR contracts- note that Dynegy contracts(2) are $2.2 billion in the mone=
y as of time of analysis....Don't know how to allocate between Dynegy and N=
RG...would have to better understand contractual relationships.

Illinois Rules would require IP to treat Enron like any other marketer with no special preference as an affiliate.  It also requires that IP keep a log of all transactions between Enron and IP.  No special filings are required at ICC.

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

If Notre Dame is brought to closure( my hope is that it will), once that
occurs, I'd like to figure out with you, or whomever you deem
appropriate from Dynegy a couple of things: 1) We currently have 65
government affairs professionals at Enron around the globe( 55 in North
America, including the Washington office)..I anticipate making
significant job cuts early in the transition and would like to make sure
that the cuts are being done with the merged company fully in mind; 2)
As you have seen from our disclosures, we have many more regulatory
approvals associated with the Enron Assets as compared to Dynegy's- I'd
like to work with you or whomever you designate to determine  the most
efficient way to process these filings through to approval. My intent
with this e-mail is not to further burden the next couple of critical
days, but merely to raise the issues so we're in a position to talk and
meet soon thereafter. I think you will find in the government affairs
professionals here the same commitment to excellence and integrity which
characterizes the folks I've come into contact with at Dynegy. I'll wait
to hear from you. Good luck in the next few days.

The short answer is that the Dynegy merger with Enron does not affect
the NWN acquisition of PGE.  Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed to
the NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale as
NWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  The
structure of the seller financing has not changed.  

Bruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron's current
situation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron's ability
to transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron's
credit rating decays to a given point.  

The Enron/Dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd Quarter of
2002.  We think we can get all regulatory approvals for the NWN
transaction completed and close before that.  

I'm in Washington, D.C. today and tomorrow.  We have a pre-filing
meeting with the SEC on the NWN transaction tomorrow.  I'll be back in
the office on Friday.  I can be reached by pager 888.354.7356 or cell
phone 503.539.4733 if you need more information or have further
questions.

I did not hit "reply to all" when creating this message. Sorry.

Thanks.  How does the Dynergy bid for Enron affect things?  Do you know
how
long it might take for Dynergy to get approval from non-Oregon agencies
to
purchase Enron?

All, we had intended to file the NWN/PGE application on Wednesday,
November
14.  It does not appear that we are going to make that date.  We are
still
getting full review of the application and all pieces of testimony;
following that will be production.  I apologize for not having a more
firm
date, but we really are working on it and will push it out the door as
soon
as we reasonably can.  SKA (503-721-2452)

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

If Notre Dame is brought to closure( my hope is that it will), once that
occurs, I'd like to figure out with you, or whomever you deem
appropriate from Dynegy a couple of things: 1) We currently have 65
government affairs professionals at Enron around the globe( 55 in North
America, including the Washington office)..I anticipate making
significant job cuts early in the transition and would like to make sure
that the cuts are being done with the merged company fully in mind; 2)
As you have seen from our disclosures, we have many more regulatory
approvals associated with the Enron Assets as compared to Dynegy's- I'd
like to work with you or whomever you designate to determine  the most
efficient way to process these filings through to approval. My intent
with this e-mail is not to further burden the next couple of critical
days, but merely to raise the issues so we're in a position to talk and
meet soon thereafter. I think you will find in the government affairs
professionals here the same commitment to excellence and integrity which
characterizes the folks I've come into contact with at Dynegy. I'll wait
to hear from you. Good luck in the next few days.

Peter Esposito just called to report on his discussions with the OPUC Commissioners.  He stated that discussions were cordial and friendly--even to the point of sharing a laugh or two with Joan Smith.   Not much of note in any of the conversations.  Chr. Hemingway stated that Dynegy would have to file under 757.511.  Comm'r Smith stated that they would see what could be done about expediting consideration of the application.  In the context of the comment on timing, Comm'r Smith told Peter to "be straight with the Commission."  The Commissioners all asked when to expect the NWN filing.

Rick,

Here was the last analysis done in early October.  I do not believe the term curve has changed much in the last month, so it is still current.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Given the recent developments with the potential merger between Enron and Dynergy, there are a few policy questions in Illinois for which we would like guidance:

Illinois Power

We have intervened in the delivery service tariff case and are handling it primarily inhouse and solo - no other marketers.  Yesterday, we filed a Reply (greatly toned down - sticking to the facts only) to IP's memo contra our Motion to Dismiss.  URM decided not to do testimony so at this point we contemplate not showing up at the hearing and briefing only.  Recall that the issue is that to raise distribution tariffs for only unbundled customers taking service from an alternative supplier is unlawful and also anticompetitive and discriminatory, etc.  Our book impact could be around $2 million, I believe should IP get the full increase.  Moreover, it would stifle future competition.  

query:  Should our course of action be altered?

ComEd parallels IP except that it is going forward first.  We made the same arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, which was denied by the Judge.  Our plan is to seek rehearing with the full Commission and to point out that the ICC filed comments at FERC with respect to increasing only unbundled transmission rates that were fully consistent with our arguments respecting distribution!

The case is currently in hearing and we have an Enron witness testifying.

In a separate move in this case, the City of Chicago and Cook county have filed a separate action requesting an audit and investigation of ComEd's books and records alleging basically that ComEd is seeking double recovery of costs.  If we intervened it might be possible to do so without paying any of the costs, assuming Blackhawk and AES/New Energy agree (we have done this for them in the past).
Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.  Downsides are that this really gets into rate issues that in previous RCR discussions we were told to stay away from and secondly, do we really want to be supporting an audit and investigation of another utility's books and records right now, given Enron's position?  

The last point is whether there is a perception problem in being more aggressive with Com Ed than IP on the rate discrimination issue, should we decide to take that path.

Jim - 

We do indeed have litigation -- arbitration, actually -- with Brazos Electric Cooperative surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  I am going to forward a copy of the original petition and our answer to you so you will have a little more information about the dispute.  Then I would be happy to discuss.

Andy

Andy --

I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  

This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  

I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.

Thanks,

Jim
