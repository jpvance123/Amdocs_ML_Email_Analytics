Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have enclosed the initial draft of the LLC Agreement for CA Energy
Development II, LLC, marked to reflect revisions from the LLC Agreement for
CA Energy Development I, LLC circulated earlier today.  The enclosed draft
reflects my understanding that commercial operation of the transformer under
the ABB facility agreement and consent of ABB have no bearing on the timing
for exercise of the put and call provisions in Section 6.2.   The enclosed
draft is being furnished without prior review by ENA and is subject to
further revision based upon such review.   Please review the enclosed at
your earliest convenience and advise of any comments.   Thank you.

  Kay,
 I've been working on the break out agreements for CA Energy
Development at Peter Thompson's request (attached).  As you mentioned,
we need the site specific information to complete the agreements;
however, there are a few additional points that I wanted to bring to
your attention:

1.  Please confirm that Unit 17 is going to CA Energy Development I, and
Unit 18 is going to CA Energy Development II.

2.  The document needs a fax number for Ben Jacoby and the Agreement
Reference number.

3.  I need to get the cost of the dual fuel option so I can calculate
the maximum liability amount. (Peter mentions that there's a change
order 1.  Do you have that available?)  Also, I assume that we'll simply
add the dual fuel cost to the contract value to calculate the maximum
liability amount and add 25% of the dual fuel cost to the January
payment to arrive at the new payment amount.  Is this correct, or is
there another way it should be done?

4.  Also, I need the unit serial numbers if you'd like them included in
the agreement.

5.  Will the Retention Letter of Credit be structured differently now
that only one turbine is being sold per agreement? (I'm assuming that
the figure will be 5% of the purchase price after the dual fuel cost is
included).

That's all I have for now.  Peter has been in a conference call all
afternoon, so if you've already given some or all of this information to
him, please let me know.  You can reach me via e-mail or at (202)
662-3016.  Thanks, Chris

My only comment to the guaranty is that it should not be limited to $16.1
million.  Why shouldn't the indemnity obligations to ENA also be guaranteed?

Attached is a revised version of ENA's last redline of the letter
agreement re the transformer.  Coral has not yet reviewed these changes.
 I also suggest that the following be added to the end of Section 6.1 of
the LLC Agreement:

"For avoidance of any doubt, no Transfer by ENA shall operate to
release ENA from its obligations under Section 6.2."

I have not yet received any comments from Coral on the LLC Agreement
redraft.

I will give you specific comments Sat. morning on the acknowledgement
letter from ABB.

Kay,
   Attached are the latest versions of the CA Energy Development
breakout agreements.  Please note that, because the agreements deal with
only one Unit each, the term "Unit Liability Amount" has been replaced
with "Maximum Liability Amount."  Also, there is no need for an Exhbit
N-1, so that reference has been deleted as well.  The agreement is still
missing an Agreement Reference number, Ben Jacoby's fax number, and the
information needed for the exhibits.  Thanks, Chris

Attached are drafts of the documents to effect the transfer of two GE 
turbines and one ABB transformer to CAED I and CAED II.  The dates and 
amounts are bracketed, as pending the determination of the closing date.  We 
will need sets for both CAED I and CAED II, with II receiving the 
transformer.  These will be prepared with the forms are agreed.  

These documents are subject to internal Enron review, but in the interest of 
time I am sending the documents to everyone.

Thank you,

I have copies of the Articles of Organization, the LLC Agreement, and a
member's consent electing officers for each of the entities (and provided
these to George by fax on 12/7).  George advised last week that SEL wanted
the originals of the "minute books" for the two entities.   Therefore ENA
should prepare to have the original organizational documents ("minute
books") ready for delivery to SEL at closing.  I am unaware of any efforts
to obtain federal EIN's for these entities.  Thanks.

Subject:  RE: Invoice Language

All,


I need to apply for a Texas sales and use tax permit for CAED I and II very
soon.  Who has the current corporate data on these LLC entities (such as
business address, names of managing officers and directors (i.e., persons
authorized to execute documents on behalf of the LLC's), and the federal
EIN numbers)?  Also, have these entities registered to do business in
Texas?  Anyone, please help if you can.  Thanks!

Carolyn,


In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:


CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901


and as follows for the other:


CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

Thanks,
George

Kay Mann is looking for your requested language providing that GE will
invoice the LLC directly.  I am unable to find your request.  Can you
please
furnish this, as Kay intends to address this with GE today.  Thank you.

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  Today has been beyond frenetic.

I agree with your comment #1.  I expect they will ask us for a rep like the 
one in #2, but they still want to hear it from GE.

Subject: FW: Form of GE acknowledgement letter

Kay:

My comments as follows:

1. In item 1, we should reference Coral's purchase of 80% of the member 
interests, and potential purchase of the remaining 20% after the COD.

2. Shouldn't we be able to handle item 2 with an ENA rep?

I think the acknowledgement letter needs to be very narrow with respect to 
the sale of the 80% member interest to Coral, and potential purchase of the 
remaining 20%.. An acknowledgement from GE that the sale of the 80% and 
subsequent sale of the remining 20% comply with the assignment provisions 
should be sufficient.

Regards,

Ben

As soon as I hit the "send" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not 
want the LLC used for anything other than the 
acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.  Other development 
activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron 
has an ownership interest.  I'm going to double check this, as it seems the 
LOI is fairly specific on this point.

The tax representation which should be included in Section 6(d) of the
Letter Agreement is as follows:

Since its formation, the LLC has not made any tax elections on behalf
of the LLC, including any tax election that causes the LLC to be treated
as anything other than a disregarded entity in accordance with Income
Tax Regulations section 301.7701-3(b).

Attached is a copy of the last draft of the LLC Agreement prepared by
ENA which I have revised to incorporate the changes discussed in your
recent telephone conversation with Doug Pedigo.  In the interest of
time, I have not revised the attached LLC Agreement to reflect the
substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

Section 6.1(c)(iii) was revised to reflect Sweetgum's right to freely
assign its LLC interest.  Section 6.2(a) was revised to reflect
Sweetgum's right to exercise the call at any time if it either obtains
or waives the GE consent.  Section 6.2(c) was revised to allow ENA to
exercise its put at any time (i) if it obtains GE's consent in form and
substance satisfactory to Sweetgum in its sole discretion or (ii) after
all GE warranties have expired.

To expedite matters, I am forwarding these changes to you at the same
time I am forwarding them to Doug.

Ben has asked me to prepare a draft Bill of Sale - Equipment schedule to 
support the closing of the Intergen transaction.

I have generated the attached spread sheet showing the following information 
for the two LM6000 turbines and the one ABB transformer:

 Unit Description (Column A)
 Unit Number (Column B)
 Unit Serial # (Column C)
 Unit Delivery Date (Column D)
 Physical location of the units as of the date of schedule (1/5/01) (Column E)
 The equipment and all rights provided to Buyer under Agreement dated ____ 
(Column F)

I have filled in descriptions for each piece of equipment (Column A).  I need 
help with the following:

Chris:  Please fill in Columns B, C, D & E with current information from our 
equipment contracts.

Rebecca:  Please obtain the information for Columns A, B, C, D, E, & F  from 
Catherine in Global Finance.  This should be the information that was 
recorded in the TurboPark financing documents when the equipment option 
agreements were moved into TurboPark from West LB.

Kay:  Please fill in the dates for Column F and let me know if any additional 
information is required to complete this schedule.

Please forward me a revised copy of this spreadsheet once you have completed 
the relevant information.  I welcome your input on the information contained 
within this schedule.

Our goal here is to create a schedule which is factually correct (based on 
all of the relevant agreements) and does not create any 
inconsistencies/conflicts with the TurboPark documents.  We need to deliver a 
draft of this schedule to the TurboPark banks tomorrow  for their review.  
This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth 
transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the 
respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 
1/15/01 deadline.

Call me to discuss any of this information.

Fred

Kay:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents for review:

 1. $16,100,000 Promissory Note to be executed by the LLC
payable to ENA;
 2. Membership Certificate No. 1 (100% in the name of ENA);
 3. Membership Certificate No. 2 (20% in the name of ENA);
 4. Membership Certificate No. 3 (80% in the name of TEH).

We have not drafted the form of the promissory note to be executed by the
LLC payable to TEH, as we have no information on the proposed terms of that
note.

I understand that the back sides of the membership certificates require a
little extra handiwork to print, but hopefully the substance of the
certificates will come across.  If you would prefer that I fax over the
certificates, please let me know.  Thank you.

Kay and George:

We have enclosed revised drafts of the First Amended and Restated
Limited
Liability Company Agreements for each of CA Energy Development I LLC
and CA
Energy Development II LLC, marked to reflect revisions from the forms
initialed for identification by the parties on December 27, 2000.  The
only
revisions are in Section 3.2 (to reflect that SEL is a limited
partnership
rather than a limited liability company) and in the signature block for
SEL

Kay,

I've reviewed and added updates to contact info.  The serial number, $
amounts, and performance values are correct.  Didn't see any thing more, but
let's let Kent get back with his comments, if any further.

Thanks,

Lee

Mike:

Attached is a form of acknowledgement letter that Coral would like ABB to 
sign at such time as the Facility Agreement is signed. The Facility Agreement 
is the "break-out contract" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being 
assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently 
selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS 
Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial 
operations of  their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed 
as soon as possible. I assume there should not be any issue as the total 
transformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to 
the execution of the Facility Agreement.

Lastly, it would be very helpful if we could somehow expedite the completion 
of the Facility Agreement. I believe Dave Onuscheck has the form proposed by 
Kay, and that we are awaiting his comments.

Thanks much for your help on this.

Regards,


Ben

Enclosed for review are drafts of the following documents:

1.  Promissory Note payable by CA/ED-I to ENA in the amount of $16,100,000;
2.  Membership Certificate No. 1 in the name of ENA for 100% interest;
3.  Membership Certificate No. 2 in the name of ENA for 80% interest; and
4.  Membership Certificate No. 3 in the name of SEL for 20% interest.

Similar notes will be prepared for each of the three transactions.  Similar
membership certificates will be prepared for CA/ED-II.  I have not prepared
a draft of a promissory note payable by the LLC to SEL, assuming that
Fulbright & Jaworski will want to prepare this.  Please advise of any
comments at your convenience.  If acceptable, I will forward drafts to
George.  Thanks.

  Attached please find clean and blackline versions of the exhibits to
the CA Energy Development Agreements.

To complete the exhibits, we need to include the following:

1. Exhibits B-1, H-2 and R need to be added.

2. Do we need to add language to section B of Exhibit A-1 because
these are dual fuel turbines?

3. Should the scope be changed in Exhibit B because these are dual
fuel turbines?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all of the
documents that it should have received by now.

6.  If required, we need to have a Seller Parent Guaranty for
Exhibit C-1.

Hi Rob,

We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then 
selling the equity.  I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption 
agreement.  Is this ok?  Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?

This is the same transaction I called you about this am.  Any thoughts on the 
notice question?




Thanks,

Kay

Attached please find a clean copy of the latest draft of the
E-Next Generation CISO1 Agreement and Exhibits, as well as blacklines
showing changes made to each from the prior draft we circulated.  This
is identical to the documents for the CISO2 documents but for the unit
number and agreement reference.  To complete the agreement, we need Ben
Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel performance guarantee. As for the
exhibits, we need the information for Part B of Exhibit A-1.  We will
also need to add Exhibit H-2, Exhibit R (if necessary) and confirmation
that we will not have any site specific information usually contained in
Exhibit U.

After you review the Coral Acknowledgement Letter I sent earlier, it would be 
really helpful if you would write me a letter on your letterhead saying that 
your prepared to sign the letter when you sign the Facility Agreement. 
Attached is some suggested language.

Ben,

I suggest that we get EECC (or whoever) to put the stuff together.  You can't 
count on the right people being around after the 15th of December, and 10 
days is nothing.

Team,

I do not know if we have a full and complete set of documents, and if so, how 
long it will take to get these documents copied.  Ben, can you address that 
issue?  I don't want to assume that this is a slam dunk, as this is the kind 
of thing you can trip up on, especially since they are on a tight 
construction schedule.

I'm not sure I understand his second comment.

Subject: Three (3) letter agreements

I have not received all TEH's comments, however, in the interest of time
I am passing along the following changes to all three (3) of the letter
agreements:

Section 3(g):  The addition of "in ENA's possession" should be deleted
from Section 3(g).  We were told that Exhibit T (or Exhibit B-2 in the
case of the ABB) was deleted from the Facility Agreement because the
documents had already been furnished to ENA.  If all these documents
have been furnished by GE (or ABB), then the addition of "in ENA's
possession" is not needed.  If all of these documents have not been
furnished by GE (or ABB), then the Facility Agreement should specify the
documents not yet furnished and bind GE to furnish those not yet
furnished, and in the letter agreement ENA should covenant to deliver
the specified documents which have been furnished.

Section 6(b):  Clause (iv) of Section 6(b) should be revised as
follows:

"(iv) following the date from the execution of the Facility Agreement
through the closing of the Transaction, neither ENA nor the LLC
will not have agreed to or issued agree to or issue any written election
or waiver with respect to the Facility Agreement as of the date of
closing."

The draft of the Facililty Agreement contemplates that the date of the
Facility Agreement and the date of execution are the same.

Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the
Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA
Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter
Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB
transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP
relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will
be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper
LLC.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before
review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have
additional changes and comments.

In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for
Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following
requirements of InterGen:

(i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been
deleted;

(ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of
Section 3; and

(iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been
added as  a new Section 17.

The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted
from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my
understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's
agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general
language of the clause.

Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other
concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements
and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect
the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits
thereto.

I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the
closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.

Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are
available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments
you have on the closing.

George

Kay/Ben,

The attached agreement was forwarded to me by Catherine Clark.  Do we have to 
amend the attached Agreement to reflect the assignment of the Purchase Option 
to the LLCs instead of Enron and, is this possible under the master 
agreement?  Or, does this assign the Purchase Option to Enron who will then 
assign it to the LLCs?  Please advise.

Also, as Kay Mann, Rose Engeldorf, and I agreed on Friday evening, we did not 
send out the purchase option notice.  However, we still need to provide 
formal notice in order to provide sufficient time for WLB to make the 
appropriate arrangements.  The concern was whether Enron would trigger any 
balance sheet issues by providing notice to West LB.

I will be in the office by 7:30 AM on Monday and would like to meet to 
discuss any outstanding issues as soon as possible.


Raimund D. Grube

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay

Randy:

As I indicated in my voicemail, Coral has requested that Intergen (or its 
designated project affiliate - Sweetgum Energy L.P.) be the counterparty that 
transacts with Enron.  Based on current information, the structure of the 
transaction has not materially changed from the Coral deal structure 
described in the 11/30/00 DASH.  Intergen is holding a Board meeting this 
afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval.

With regard to the timing of the funding, it is my understanding that once 
the Letter Agreement has been executed (target date: 12/21) and associated 
documents accepted by Intergen, Enron will notify TurboPark of its intention 
to assign the equipment to Intergen (target notice date: 12/22).  Once the 
assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the 
transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after 
receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction 
proceeds.  There is a desire by East Origination to, if possible, book the 
earnings from this transaction in fiscal year 2000.

Rebecca Walker (ENA development) is planning to run a D&B report on Sweetgum 
Energy L.P.  tomorrow once she receives the State and Headquarters 
information necessary.  I traded voicemails with Ben Glisan today on this 
counterparty change.  He asked that I work with RAC deal personell on this 
matter. 

Based upon your voicemail it appears that we do not need to amend the DASH 
based upon this change in counterparty.  Let me know if any of the above 
information changes your opinion.  

Call me if you wish to discuss this information.

Thanks,
Fred Mitro

When reviewing the blackline of the CA Energy Development/ABB Facility
Agreement, please be aware that we had to remove the blacklining from
Exhibit C in order for us to be able to save and transmit the document.
Thus, Exhibit C shows only the guaranteed delivery date for the one Unit
acquired under the Agreement and not the remainder of the Units acquired
under the original West LB Agreement.

I forgot to mention something yesterday.  3 (g) states that within 10 days of 
closing we will provide Coral with the documents on Exhibit T.  I personally 
do not know if we have all the documents listed. We need to either verify

in our possession.

I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents,
however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments
on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be
attached to the letter agreements.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter
agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter
agreement.

Facility Agreements:

1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility
Agreements should be amended to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

This is the same comment I made earlier.

2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from
the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility
Agreement.

3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I
as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.

4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is
still relevant.

5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to
Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point
up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.

6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to "oF" should be corrected
to contain the degree symbol.

I have not received all TEH's comments, however, in the interest of time
I am passing along the following changes to all three (3) of the letter
agreements:

Section 3(g):  The addition of "in ENA's possession" should be deleted
from Section 3(g).  We were told that Exhibit T (or Exhibit B-2 in the
case of the ABB) was deleted from the Facility Agreement because the
documents had already been furnished to ENA.  If all these documents
have been furnished by GE (or ABB), then the addition of "in ENA's
possession" is not needed.  If all of these documents have not been
furnished by GE (or ABB), then the Facility Agreement should specify the
documents not yet furnished and bind GE to furnish those not yet
furnished, and in the letter agreement ENA should covenant to deliver
the specified documents which have been furnished.

Section 6(b):  Clause (iv) of Section 6(b) should be revised as
follows:

"(iv) following the date from the execution of the Facility Agreement
through the closing of the Transaction, neither ENA nor the LLC
will not have agreed to or issued agree to or issue any written election
or waiver with respect to the Facility Agreement as of the date of
closing."

The draft of the Facililty Agreement contemplates that the date of the
Facility Agreement and the date of execution are the same.

1.  The GE and ABB acknowledgment letters are in the attached e-mail from
George Kutzschbach.

2.  When I spoke to George yesterday about the proposed amendment, he had no
objections to the concept of the amendment.  However, I have not heard from
him since circulating the draft amendment.  I just left a voice mail for him
to get back to me with comments and will let you know.  (While writing this
e-mail, I received an e-mail from Doug Pedigo, and his comments are as
follows: "Seems to me you could combine paragraphs 2 and 3 and delete 4
through 7, but if this makes Enron comfortable, I guess I am OK with it.")
I will not make any revisions based on his comments unless you feel obliged
to do so.

3.  Please let me know if you need me to get involved any further in the
Escrow Agreements.

4.  A revised closing checklist is attached.

Randy:

Based upon our discussions with Intergen this afternoon, there is a desire of 
both Enron and Intergen to execute the transaction documents tomorrow 
afternoon.  I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral 
Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or 
if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval.

Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure 
are as follows:

1.  At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed 
transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated 
affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.).

2.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the 
requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee.  The major risk (i.e. 
non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been 
mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the 
transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment 
Assigment Agreement.

3.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a 
"no-shop" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the 
turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter 
Agreement(s).

4.  Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification 
of the transaction "sunset dates".  These are the dates by which, once the 
Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities 
Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment 
Agreement.  This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 
to 1/15/01.  The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from 
Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered 
within these timeframes.

5.  Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the 
Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment 
warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen.  The 
modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its "put 
option" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by 
requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written 
consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. 
 This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier 
potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current 
Agreement language.

Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires 
the DASH to be revised and re-approved.

Call me to discuss.

  Attached please find clean and blackline versions of the exhibits to
the CA Energy Development Agreements.

To complete the exhibits, we need to include the following:

1. Exhibits B-1, H-2 and R need to be added.

2. Do we need to add language to section B of Exhibit A-1 because
these are dual fuel turbines?

3. Should the scope be changed in Exhibit B because these are dual
fuel turbines?

4. In Section 3.1 of Exhibit K, the terms "Specific Date" and
"Recovery Schedule" are not defined.

5. For Exhibit T, please confirm that Enron has received all of the
documents that it should have received by now.

6.  If required, we need to have a Seller Parent Guaranty for
Exhibit C-1.

Kay:

I have copies of the Articles of Organization, the LLC Agreement, and a
member's consent electing officers for each of the entities (and provided
these to George by fax on 12/7).  George advised last week that SEL wanted
the originals of the "minute books" for the two entities.   Therefore ENA
should prepare to have the original organizational documents ("minute
books") ready for delivery to SEL at closing.  I am unaware of any efforts
to obtain federal EIN's for these entities.  Thanks.

All,


I need to apply for a Texas sales and use tax permit for CAED I and II very
soon.  Who has the current corporate data on these LLC entities (such as
business address, names of managing officers and directors (i.e., persons
authorized to execute documents on behalf of the LLC's), and the federal
EIN numbers)?  Also, have these entities registered to do business in
Texas?  Anyone, please help if you can.  Thanks!

Carolyn,


In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:


CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901


and as follows for the other:


CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

Thanks,
George

Subject: Sweetgum/ENA


I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents,
however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments
on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be
attached to the letter agreements.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter
agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter
agreement.

Facility Agreements:

1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility
Agreements should be amended to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

This is the same comment I made earlier.

2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from
the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility
Agreement.

3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I
as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.

4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is
still relevant.

5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to
Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point
up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.

6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to "oF" should be corrected
to contain the degree symbol.

the agreements to serve as a placeholder for the liquid fuel guarantee.
Do you want something more definitive, such as a section heading and a

Also, are you waiting on any other deliverables from me or are we just

Through my discussions with Rebecca I have discovered the following:

1.  Regarding the transformer, the contract counterparty is "ABB Power T & D 
Company"

2.  The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB 
financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges 
or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included 
in the calculation of the Payoff #.  The full cost of the transformer would 
be $842,803.

3.  The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an 
average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE.  This price does not 
include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine.  The 
full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000.  The $280K in change order 
was picked up in the original payoff # prepared by Global Finance.

Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current 
payoff # determined by Global Finance.  I will talk with him first thing in 
the morning.  We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values.

Fred

Mike:

The retainage will be an obligation of the LLC. I can't imagine that this 
would be an issue from a credit perspective. Keep in mind that the LLC will 
have a put back to ABB for the transformers at the 30% level as per the 
master agreement.

Regards,

Ben

Ben,
At first pass I think that this will probably work as long as some one 
promises
to pay the retainage (10%).  I will have to of course have to get the 
agreement
of Frank and Dave.  I have sent this to both of them and should hear back form
them tomorrow, as should you.
I'll have my computer with me and will be in communication via e-mail.  If you
need me more urgently than that contact either Karla at the office or Kathryn 
at
the house.  You haave all the numbers.
MIKE

After you review the Coral Acknowledgement Letter I sent earlier, it would
be really helpful if you would write me a letter on your letterhead saying
that your prepared to sign the letter when you sign the Facility Agreement.
Attached is some suggested language.

Thanks much,

Hi there,

I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for
GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It
would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or
tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals
picked up from Lee's office.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Carolyn,

Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:

1.  Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the 
transformer as well as the turbine?

2.  Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload 
responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the 
equipment, not just the sale.  I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.

3.  Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and 
commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a 
reference is fine).

4.  Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the 
confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?  If fact, please review 
the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss 
same.

5.  Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.  We should 
specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed 
by a credit worthy entity.  

6.  Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter 
with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the 
obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility 
agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to 
fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.

7.  Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to 
convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the 
nitty gritty of our financing structure.

I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of 
where we are headed.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: InterGen/ENA - GE Turbines & ABB Transformer

Attached are clean and redlined versions of revised drafts of (i) the
Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to CA
Energy Development I, LLC and the GE generator set, and (ii) the Letter
Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP relating to the ABB
transformer.  The Letter Agreement between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP
relating to CA Energy Development II, LLC and the GE generator set will
be in the same form as item (i) above with changes to reflect the proper
LLC.

To expedite matters, these revised drafts are being sent to you before
review by InterGen with the understanding that InterGen may have
additional changes and comments.

In addition to changes necessitated by the substitution of Sweetgum for
Tejas, the letter agreements have been revised to reflect the following
requirements of InterGen:

(i)  The parent guaranty on behalf of Sweetgum Energy LP has been
deleted;

(ii)  A mutual covenant requiring the Parties to use all reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent as been added to the end of
Section 3; and

(iii)  A no shop clause on the part of ENA and its affiliates has been
added as  a new Section 17.

The reference to the TRY Ventures International agreement was deleted
from the letter agreement relating to the ABB transformer since it is my
understanding that the ABB transformer was not covered by Coral's
agreement with TRY.  ENA would nevertheless be protected by the general
language of the clause.

Although InterGen is still reviewing these documents for tax and other
concerns, for now the only contemplated changes to the LLC Agreements
and the GE and ABB acknowledgement letters are those needed to reflect
the substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

InterGen is still reviewing the Facility Agreement and exhibits
thereto.

I have passed on ENA's suggestion regarding the extension of the
closing date, but have not yet had a response from InterGen.

Doug Pedigo will be tied up tomorrow morning, but Doug and I are
available after lunch for a telephone conference to discuss any comments
you have on the closing.

George

Gentlemen,

The ESA docs are being reviewed internally for financing and accounting 
issues.  Thanks for turning the docs in such a timely manner.

COA is on stand by, due to our need to focus on ESA and two new, identical 
contracts (remember, we have a lot of turbines!)

The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe 
units 17 & 18.  These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the 
base prices of each will be increased appropriately.  We will pay 75% of the 
price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will 
be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option.

The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS:  CA Energy 
Development I, LLC  and CA Energy Development II, LLC.  Use Ben Jacoby at 
1400 Smith, Houston, 77002 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft.

We don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions, so we will have to 
work with generics.

We would like to have a draft yesterday, but seeing as that is impossible, 
please advise when you think it can be ready.

Thanks again and again,

Kay

Kay:

Pursuant to your request, we have enclosed revised drafts of (i) the Letter
Agreement pertaining to CA Energy Development I, LLC and (ii) the First
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CA Energy
Development I, LLC.  Also enclosed are redlined drafts of each marked to
reflect revisions from the initial drafts furnished earlier today.

We believe that our revised description of the "transaction" in the Letter
Agreement (which now provides that each event is a condition precedent to
the other and is deemed to have occurred simultaneous with the other) should
satisfy your concerns as to both the creditworthiness issue and the timing
issue.  At the closing, the signed Facility Agreement will not be
"delivered" unless the loan is funded by Tejas.

With respect to your concern about confidentiality, we have reviewed the
confidentiality provisions of the master contract.  One might conclude that
the master contract does not expressly permit the disclosure of confidential
information by Enron to prospective assignees, as a "Permitted Assignee"
seems to include only an assignee who has received an assignment.  On the
other hand, it is arguable that there would never be any assignee without
some disclosure, so that disclosure to prospective assignees must have been
intended by the parties.  Alternatively, query whether Enron's "performance
of its obligations" under the master agreement could be construed to include
using [and disclosing] confidential information in discussions with
prospective assignees and their lenders, thereby permitting disclosure to
Coral/Tejas under the second full paragraph of Section 21.1.

Assuming that we can satisfy ourselves with respect to this issue, it then
seems prudent to require Coral/Tejas to immediately execute a
Confidentiality Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions comparable
to those set forth in the master agreement.  In the alternative, you may
wish to revise the letter of intent (assuming it is to be executed
momentarily) to include comparable confidentiality provisions.

Please review the enclosed and advise of any additional comments.  If we may
be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  Thank you.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the following documents:

 1. Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
turbine letter agreement with Coral);

 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean
copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of
the transformer letter agreement with Coral, and blacklined copy marked to
reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1
above);

 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the
representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where
necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.  The
justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such
representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that
appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what
is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it
wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the
representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be
eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we
rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more
clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur
purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments.
Thank you.

ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED - DO NOT PRODUCE

Kay,

Thanks again for helping me out.  I wanted to pass on a few things that were 
discussed immediately prior to the execution of the LOI just so that nothing 
is lost in the changing of the guards.

1)  John Keffer asked ENA to determine whether the equity interest held by 
ENA in the SPV must be a voting interest.  The concern here was that the LLC 
Agreement was structured to have the 20% owner hold a non-voting member 
interest and John wanted to be certain that this satisfied the terms of the 
GE LM6000 contract;

2)  The LOI talks about the "minimal representations" that ENA will be 
required to give to Coral in connection with the disposition of the 80% 
member interest to the Acquisition Entity.  I spoke with Jim Shepherd 
(internal counsel to Coral - who by the way was a colleague/friend of mine 
when I was employed at Coral) and assured him that ENA would be willing to 
provide the necessary reps to give Coral comfort that we hadn't done anything 
with the SPV (i.e. incur liabilities or convey other interests in the SPV);

3)  Jim Shepherd and I also spoke about expressly incorporating the 
confidentiality provisions of the LOI into the final deal documentation.  I 
wanted to be certain that Coral could not discuss deal terms with anyone else 
(for fear that the deal structure becomes known in the market place);

4)  On the matter of taxes, Don Whaley (of Coral) expressly agreed with Ben 
Jacoby that all ad valorem taxes and other taxes associated with ownership 
(and the sale/transfer) of the units would be borne by Coral.  This comment 
about the ad valorem taxes (which aren't expressly stated in the LOI) is 
particularly important because (as you know) we anticipate a $250,000 tax on 
each turbine that is delivered prior to year end.  I believe that Ben wants 
to execute a letter agreement with GE (similar to the one that was executed 
for the first 14 units) pursuant to which we accept title/delivery in 
consideration of a $300,000 waiver of cancellation fees.  I have reservations 
about this because ENA will effectively be making an additional 300k per unit 
by stuffing a $250,000 obligation to Coral.  Doesn't really pass the smell 
test in my book.

5)  One final item, this deal has not been DASHed and a legal risk memo has 
not been prepared.  I would think that the biggest legal risk in this 
transaction is the risk of discovery of the true deal structure by GE.  I 
prepared a legal risk memo that highlighted this risk when I did the original 
deal with Air Liquide and am happy to share that with you if you so desire.

Again, many thanks.

Stuart

Ben/Kay,
After reviewing the contract with Dave we found only a couple of points that 
we
would like to mention;
1) 1.48 the Maximum Liability Amount should be $768,000 USD
2) The unit will not be delivered until the last 10% (ten percent) retention 
is
paid and we will post the surety bond as shown in in Exhibit D
3) ABB would not buy back the unit except from Enron.

Please let me know if there is any way that we may further assist you.

Carolyn,

In addition to the invoice change, the periods should be removed from
"LLC" on the cover page, in the first paragraph of the first page, in
Section 1.78 and on the signature page of each Facility Agreement.  The
change relating to invoices is that the address of the invoices in
Section 6.7.2  should be as follows for one of the Facility Agreements:

CA Energy Development I, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

and as follows for the other:

CA Energy Development II, LLC
c/o Sweetgum Energy L.P.
c/o InterGen North America L.P.
909 Fannin, Suite 2200
Houston, Texas 77010
Attention: John Jones
Fax: (713) 374-3901

Thanks,
George

I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received 
today.

Transformer Letter

2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of "ABB et al." when ABB is defined?  Also, 
the "certain agreement" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and 
ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for 
purchaser, and ABB, as amended.

3(a):  have two sets of "(i), (ii)" in para.  It's also unclear what this 
para actually says.

4:  definition of "Term" should go after (b) no?


Turbine Letter

3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.

3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment 
due to GE.

3(g):  the "certain agreement" is not between GE and ENA.  See first comment 
under Transformer Letter.  There is also the usage of "et al." after GE.

4:  same comment as in Transformer Letter.

I haven't had a chance to review the LLC Agreement yet.

Ben Jacoby has asked that I forward the attached drafts of the letter 
agreement and LLC agreement.  These forms relate to the "turbine only" LLC, 
but once we get the kinks worked out of this we can move forward with 
finishing the rest.

These documents are subject to Enron internal review, but in the interest of 
time we are getting this out for comment.

Thanks,

I don't believe Ben agreed to absolutely free transferablity on their part.

Subject:  Certain revisions to LLC Agreement

Attached is a copy of the last draft of the LLC Agreement prepared by
ENA which I have revised to incorporate the changes discussed in your
recent telephone conversation with Doug Pedigo.  In the interest of
time, I have not revised the attached LLC Agreement to reflect the
substitution of Sweetgum for Tejas.

Section 6.1(c)(iii) was revised to reflect Sweetgum's right to freely
assign its LLC interest.  Section 6.2(a) was revised to reflect
Sweetgum's right to exercise the call at any time if it either obtains
or waives the GE consent.  Section 6.2(c) was revised to allow ENA to
exercise its put at any time (i) if it obtains GE's consent in form and
substance satisfactory to Sweetgum in its sole discretion or (ii) after
all GE warranties have expired.

To expedite matters, I am forwarding these changes to you at the same
time I am forwarding them to Doug.

Although InterGen has not completed its review of the Facility
Agreements, at Kay Mann's suggestion and to expedite matters, I am
passing on changes which InterGen requires with respect to Sections
17.3(a) and 17.4.1 of both Facility Agreements:

1.  Section 17.3(a) should be revised to read as follows:

"promptly refund the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion
of the Purchase Amount) and pay Cover Damages plus Termination Costs
described in Sections 17.4.2(i) and 17.4.2(iv) described below; or"

2.  The third and fourth sentences of Section 17.4.1 should be revised
to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.  If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is less than the Proper Scope Value, the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Scope Value Due")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."

It is InterGen's understanding that the Purchase Amount is currently
$1,829,000, subject to adjustment by future change orders, and that the
amounts previously paid plus the Purchase Amount are equal to the
Maximum Liability Amount of $14,352,000, subject to adjustment by future
change orders.  It is essential to InterGen that CA Development I and CA
Development II receive credit for the amounts previously paid and that
they not be required to go outside of the Facility Agreement to
determine such amounts.
