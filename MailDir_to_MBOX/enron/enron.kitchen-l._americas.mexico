MEXICO'S NATURAL GAS: WHY HASN'T A SPOT MARKET DEVELOPED?
Current regulation allows Mexico to develop a transparent import and export spot market; however, despite the reform, Pemex continues to be the key player, not only supplying natural gas but also controlling sales contracts with most users. The key question is, why hasn't the spot market developed? Some of the reasons are:

* flaw in the current price methodology

* a lack of price transparency in transportation

* price deals offered by Pemex

***********************************************************************

MEXICO'S SLOWING ECONOMY AFFECTS POWER GENERATION GROWTH
Electricity production growth rates in Mexico have slowed dramatically from
2000 levels as Mexico's economy slows in line with that of the United States.
Natural gas consumption by the power sector continues to grow at over 15
percent annually, however, as new combined-cycle power plants enter service.
Many new capacity projects are also delayed, keeping the market tight through
the summer. Mexico's longer-term power supply and demand balance will depend on

* successful completion of the pending power sector reform process

* sufficient new capacity through the independent power producer program to 
bridge the transition from the current structure to a competitive market

Louise,

I heard your speech at the all employee meeting and was interested in more information regarding you efforts to recruit people for the Mexican market.  I joined the Continental Power Trading Group in '98 and before that in Houston for a year and a half on the power night shift and on the risk management side.  I would like to find out more about what you are planning in Mexico and see if I my background can add any value.  I lived in Mexico many years and have a deep understanding of the culture and language.  I have a keen interest in Latin America and would enjoy exploring opportunities in the Mexican market. 

Best of luck,

Adrian Mancebo

Louise,

Attached is an excel file that contains the following:

1. Summary - a table of what we believe DeAcero could expect to save at different gas prices.
2. A list of advantages and risks of entering into the import deal.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call.

Thanks,
Marc.

Louise, 

Great news that you are coming to the Monterrey Conference!  
FYI, conferences in both cities are pretty full already.  We have almost 100 people confirmed for the Monterrey event, and 85 for MExico City. 
The audience is basically Finance Directors, Treasurers and Purchasing Managers of the top industries in Mexico.  We covered pretty much the whole country, so in Monterrey there are people coming from all the northern states, such as Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango, Zacatecas, Etc. 

The agenda is attached, and I'll Jump-start the conference, talk about the agenda, introduce the members of the Enron de Mexico Team that will be present, including you and then,  Suggestion: I think we should dedicate a minute of silence, in respect to the victims of last week's events.  After that, I will introduce you, and then pass you the microphone. There will be simultaneous translation so you can feel free to talk in English. 

 << File: Agenda MTY Conference Sep 2001.ppt >> 


Suggested talking points: 

- Review Enron's Primary Achievements in Mexico: 
	- Providing Risk Management Products for the Mexican Industry 
		- Leveraging Enron's Major Strengths and Capabilities
		- Leading provider of Natural Gas and Fuel Oil Derivatives
		- Serving the Top-200 energy-intensive private companies in Mexico
		- Providing specific products for the Mexican market
		- Helping businesses to increase thier optionality in a regulated environment
				
	- Monterrey Cogeneration Plant
		-  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
		- Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
		- Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.

- Expand our Business in the Future:
		- Derived from the Integration of Mexico - US Energy Markets
		- Provide Transparency and Optionality to markets (Power and Gas) 
			U.S. - Sourced Power
			Cogeneration or Combined Cycle facilities
		
I will coordinate with Tammy for picking you up at the Monterrey Airport. Let me know if you want to have lunch or if you plan to eat during your flight. 

Best Regards, 
Jaime Williams

			
Steve sent you a breifing on the Vitro Plant, in case the topic comes up:  

The following is a brief bullet point description of the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant to incorporate intom the information you are send Louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow.

*  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
* Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
* Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.
* Power Purchasers are Vitro (110 MW), Imsa (90 MW), and Apasco (40 MW) under 15 year PPAs.
* Vitro subsidiary Alcali to be supplied 210 tons per hour of steam under a 15 year SPA.
* Transmission and Distribution of the electricity to be provided by the CFE.
* Natural Gas to be provided by PGPB (Pemex).
* Financing provided by the Inter-American Development Bank.
* Major Equipment Foundations have been completed at the Construction Site, and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations.
* The offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over US$ 400 MM over the term of the 15 year agreements

A couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up, all Enron people should refer to the project as the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant and not the Vitro plant so as not to diminish Imsa and Apasco, and to the extent we are questioned on the sell-down of the equity the response there is that initiative, while not finalized, is being pursued to manage Enron's balance sheet and that Enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility.

If we make 1 ct. of orig, we would do $44,000. The $4.796 MM is the quote from the Trader. The position would then be closed.

REFORM DELAYS MAY STRAIN THE GRID AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE
Substantial and definitive electricity sector reform is needed to ensure that
Mexico?s economic engine continues to run smoothly.  The stalled power reform
process is putting investor confidence in Mexico at risk, however, affecting
planning strategies and new projects as investors await a clearer understanding
of the energy playing field.  Key factors include

* waning interest in Mexico?s independent power producer program

* continued strong demand growth expected

* lack of details on the proposed reforms, which have not been made public

Jaime,

While reviewing some recent expenditures out of the Monterrey office it was noted that several checks signed by you did not have  properly approved supporting documentation. The absence of properly approved documentation for expenditures is a violation of  Enron Corporate Treasury policies and Enron North America standard operating procedure.  Specifically we found three expense reports which were reimbursed to Mr. Jaime Alatorre for expenses from April to August, that were not authorized by anyone prior to the check being signed and released to Mr. Alatorre.  

I understand that a transition has been taking place involving you and Steve Irvin as a result of the departure of Max Yzaguirre and that confusion about proper authorizations during this transition probably led to this circumstance but I wanted to let you know that adherence to Enron's authorization policies is crucial to our internal control structure and that violations will not be permitted.

Susan Helton will soon be discussing with you the entire process of disbursing funds out of the Monterrey and Mexico city offices in an attempt to get the internal controls in this area consistent with those in other Enron remote offices.  I expect some of the major changes to be as follows:

*Mexico City petty cash account to be closed 
*Two signatures to be required on all checks\wires; you and Steve Irvin 
*Checks to be processed once a week only (except emergencies) which will help with the availability of you and Steve
*Expense reports of Jaime Williams, Jaime Alatorre and Steve Irvin to be authorized by Louise Kitchen prior to being reimbursed

Please call me with any questions or concerns

Title: US/Mexico Trade Cross-border Energy Interconnections at the Forefront?

***********************************************************************

INCREASING POLITICAL AND MARKET PRESSURES TO ERASE THE US/MEXICO ENERGY BORDER

The policy focus in the administrations of both Vicente Fox in Mexico and
George W. Bush in the United States, combined with the high-profile energy
crisis in California and record-level gas prices, has pushed energy trade and
interconnections to the forefront of the political agenda. Cross-border energy
flows will likely be a prominent theme between the two countries in the months
ahead. However, critical technical, regulatory, and financing constraints must
be overcome before these energy flows reach the potential indicated by current
market fundamentals.

Key issues affecting US-Mexico cross-border energy flows include
* asymmetrical regulatory and market structures

* power grid synchronization issues

* high investment needs in a changing regulatory environment

* uncertainty of long-term regional supply-demand imbalances

Has apparantly been contacted by an Enron-sponsored relocation team to move him back. His contract specifies Houston as his base and the company's obligation to return him.

He has not instructed them to begin moving, nor has he been informed yet of whether or not he is still employed.

Dear Georgeanne, I am surprised, and you can be sure that I try very hard to adhere to Enron Corporate Treasury Policies, which I haven't actually seen so far. 
As a matter of fact, Max Yzaguirre used to sign Alatorre's expenses, and I was specifically told to do so, until further notice. Now, let me tell you this is the wrong way of giving me notice....

By the way, April's expense report of Alatorre was signed by Max and properly documented.  June's expense report of Alatorre was signed by me, after being told to do so, and properly documented.  July's expense report of Alatorre is NOT signed by me. 

There is a lot of signing to do for the Monterrey Office, and I am also signing all the other expenses in the Mexico City, such as: Employee's salaries, Rent, Local Telephones, Copiers, Office Maintenance, Long Distance Contract, Petty Cash, Air Tickets, Car Maintenance, and some other that might escape my mind.    Not to mention the EEIM documentation for the Vitro Plant: There are about to enter into the country 100 trucks with equipment for the EEIM power plant, for which I am the legal rep, and I have had to verify every single document I need to sign, with our legal counsel (getting proper approval), plus service contracts, banking documents, and all the documentation with the authorities, such as Energy Regulatory Commission, Federal Commission of Electricity, Secretary of Energy, etc, all of those requiring proper authorization procedures, which I do follow. 

There are other Corp. Policies, like Trading and Risk Management Procedures that are clearly writtn and I do follow daily. So, I totally agree with you that adherence to Enron's authorization policies are crucial, and not only to your internal control, but also for our business to have sustainability.  However, I strongly believe that such policies should come from your area, and if here is a communication gap, we need to fill it immediately.

Your proposals sound very good, and I ask you to help us formalize the procedures and minimize the time we spend performing this duties, since it has become a burden to my commercial activities.  In the meantime, please notify me (differently, if possible) if there are any other exceptions or special authorization procedures, in order to avoid this situation again. 

I am copying Steve Irvin, so that he knows he is back into this rewarding activity. 

Best regards, 

Jaime Williams.







	Georgeanne Hodges/ENRON@enronXgate 08/21/2001 10:01 PM 	   To: Jaime Williams/NA/Enron@ENRON  cc: Louise Kitchen/ENRON@enronXgate, Wes Colwell/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: Approvals on Monterrey expenditures	


Jaime,

While reviewing some recent expenditures out of the Monterrey office it was noted that several checks signed by you did not have  properly approved supporting documentation. The absence of properly approved documentation for expenditures is a violation of  Enron Corporate Treasury policies and Enron North America standard operating procedure.  Specifically we found three expense reports which were reimbursed to Mr. Jaime Alatorre for expenses from April to August, that were not authorized by anyone prior to the check being signed and released to Mr. Alatorre.  

I understand that a transition has been taking place involving you and Steve Irvin as a result of the departure of Max Yzaguirre and that confusion about proper authorizations during this transition probably led to this circumstance but I wanted to let you know that adherence to Enron's authorization policies is crucial to our internal control structure and that violations will not be permitted.

Susan Helton will soon be discussing with you the entire process of disbursing funds out of the Monterrey and Mexico city offices in an attempt to get the internal controls in this area consistent with those in other Enron remote offices.  I expect some of the major changes to be as follows:

*Mexico City petty cash account to be closed 
*Two signatures to be required on all checks\wires; you and Steve Irvin 
*Checks to be processed once a week only (except emergencies) which will help with the availability of you and Steve
*Expense reports of Jaime Williams, Jaime Alatorre and Steve Irvin to be authorized by Louise Kitchen prior to being reimbursed

Please call me with any questions or concerns

I was at the All Employee meeting yesterday where you mentioned you had open positions in Monterrey, Mexico.

I applied for the Plant Manager position on April 26.  Since then, I have traded countless messages with Daniel Batista from Human Resources.   His latest position (June 27) was that a hiring decision could not be made as the plant was likely to be sold.

Based on your comments, I assume the plant was never sold.  I am very interested in the position and would like to schedule a confidential meeting to discuss the position in further detail.  I believe to be the right person for the job.  I am including my resume for your review.   If that position is not available I would like to explore others.

 I will enumerate some of the skills and experience that make me the person you need to hire for this job posting:

Native Spanish Speaker (born in Mexico City)
Chemical Engineer / MBA
International Operating Experience under "Difficult Conditions"
Proven builder of relationships in Latin American Business and Political arenas
Ample Process Experience
Environmental and Health and Safety Experience in Industrial Settings
Proven multidisciplinary and multicultural team builder and leader
Lives by Enron's principles and Code of Ethics
Prepared to relocate internationally

I spent the last two years in Argentina working for Azurix reporting directly to the COO.  My official title was planning manager, however, as necessities surfaced, I took over a number of other roles including day to day operations, engineering, and public relations. 

Please expect a call from me on Monday to set up an appointment.

Thanks

Mariano Gomez

Louise, it fell by the wayside as we waited for FAPSA to react, the sell down turmoil, etc.  I've been in touch with them so it's not as bad thing.

Louise, just want to give you some good news, this morning at 8:50 am, we closed a transaction with Vitro.
They bought a Natural Gas Financial Swap for 100 contracts per month, for 7 months, starting Apr02, ending Oct02.  This a 7 Bcf trade which shows a lot of trust in our company and the new merger.

Best regards.

Max:

I have attached a "technical risk template" that should serve as an outline for the presentation. You may also want to discuss some of the major commercial terms and conditions that are driving schedule, performance, and cost.

You don't need to address each technical risk item in infinite detail, but we should focus on the key items of scope definition, construction execution, and contractor analysis that can impact value.  The objective is to identify what we need to pay attention to as we begin to ramp up the capital expenditure.  Defining and managing construction risk has become a popular topic given the status of the Dabhol and Cuiba projects.

We also need to take some time to discuss/settle the outstanding EE&CC invoice (now EEOS).   I would like to agree a payment number and move on down the road with EEOS.  The system we have going forward should ensure that no EEOS costs are incurred/transferred to the EA origination group until you and the Tech Services representative have pre-approved them 

Regards,
Brian

Louise,
Congratulations on your new baby and wish you all the best in your new job as Mom!
Welcome back to the office and I'm very excited and looking forward to working with you. It will be a pleasure having you in the Monterrey office and introduce you to all the Enron de Mexico team.
They are all very excited about the new organizational changes and you will be able to see for yourself all the enthusiasm going on down here.
Thursday the 28th of June or Tuesday the 3rd of July looks good in general, but I'll coordinate with Tammie.
I'm traveling today but I'll call you back to set up an agenda.

Best Regards,

Jaime Williams.

I received a voicemail from Stephen Douglas (head of tax for EWS) who doesn't seem to think a tax entity is needed for Mexico.  If you have any further issues with this, try ringing Steve.

Conference for next week: I guess it doesn't make sense for you to travel, after all that happened this week.
Numbers are great, we have 140 people confirmed already.  I'll do the welcome Speech, and Steve's part as well.
I'll try to get some pictures, and send them out to you.

Guys, FYI...We have sent out the invitation for the Conference to our customer list.  The details are below. If you want to send it to someone else, just mention it to Babby so she can have the badges ready. Just remember this is strictly for customers, which means Press, Consultants and other Associations are not welcome.
The material for the presentations needs to be in Gabriela Cantu's desk, before the 12th, because we need to do a lot of printing. 
Thanks and best regards.

Louise, Sally and I had already talked about this, and we both believe the best approach is to divide this responsibility according to the type of confirmation.

- Sally's group will keep the responsibility for chasing customers with outstanding short confirmations, ( Where we have an executed ISDA with the counterparty, 
 - Enron de Mexico will keep the responsibility for chasing the ones with outstanding long confirmations (Deemed ISDAs).  This will give us the opportunity of better negotiate the execution of Master Agreements down here. 

Sally's group will keep sending us the weekly report, and will differentiate in the report between short and long confirms, to monitor progress.  

This should work very well.

Best regards.

Thanks

I think this comes down to a question of whose responsibility it is to chase customers, as soon as the clarification is made, it should work.

Subject:	Confirmations for Monterrey Office

Have a good trip to Monterrey.  I hope that these bullet points help in your discussions tomorrow.  --Sally 


?	Gordon Heaney (Houston) was named as the Operations liasion for the Monterrey office after the Doorstep Review during the first quarter.  He is fluent in Spanish.  Confirmations have been prepared in Houston since the inception of the Mexico business.  

?	Since that time, Gordon and his boss, Joe Hunter (Manager over Derivatives Confirmations), have made a trip to Monterrey to meet the commercial team and to iron out the process flow for confirmations. 

?	Gordon and Joe meet with Agustin Perez and Jaime Williams when they are in Houston for bid week each month. 

?	Last meeting with Agustin and Jaime was last week here in Houston.  Primary focus of the conversation was around involving the commercial team in working with counterparties to get executed confirmations back in our hands.  Our commitment is to get a spreadsheet to Agustin and Jaime each week that details unexecuted confirmations and responses, or lack thereof, from the counterparties.  That way the commercial teams can push with their commercial contacts and Gordon can push with his contacts for executed confirmations.  The first of these spreadsheets was sent to the Monterrey office today, per the commitment from Gordon and Joe last week.  

Creation of confirmations:  Timing has improved since first quarter, as 25 to 30% of the deals are now done with counterparties who have recently executed ISDA master agreements.  Confirmations for deals done with these counterparties are being sent Trade Date + 1.  For counterparties without master agreements in place, there are often special riders to the confirmations with input required from Credit and Legal.  These confirmations naturally take longer and are going out to the counterparties sometime after Trade Date + 1.  I have asked Joe and Gordon to diligently push Credit and Legal to complete this process more promptly.  

Execution of confirmations:  We have found that the counterparties in Mexico are more interested in having the invoice in hand as their documentation on a deal than in returning a signed  confirmation to us.  This is an education process that we will continue to work on with the help of the commercial team in Monterrey.  

My opinion:  Let's try the weekly spreadsheet status on unexecuted confirmations for a few weeks and monitor progress.  It is my opinion that there is not the depth of business yet in the Monterrey office to warrant a fulltime confirmations person located there.  I think that the bilingual contact here working closely with the commercial team in Monterrey will make a difference.

Louise,

I believe the following will clarify the question from our meeting yesterday,

The $20MM figure that I was showing to you represents the NPV (discounted @17.6%) of the future cashflows of the project for 100% ownership from June/01 Through Dec/17.  This number does not include the moneys than Enron will have put into the project  by that time.  The amount put by Enron by that time will be $18MM (for 100%)

If we do de transaction, we will get the following cashflows:
The premium 							$14.1MM
Reimbursement of 80% of the $18MM already put by Enron	$14.4MM 
Keep 20% of future NPVs					$   4.0MM
The potential investor will contribute in the future the equity contributions for 50% of the ownership
The potential investor will give us in June/01 the amount of future equity contributions for the 30% of the ownership

The above shows the cashflows that we will be received under the 2 alternatives but this does not reflect the transaction from an earnings perspective.

>From the earnings perspective,  the following is a simplified estimation of earnings for the next 7 years under the two situations:
		
	


Please, let me know if you need further clarification

Thanks, Mar?a Elena

P.S.  Regarding  the $23MM NPV number that you see in Max's presentation, that is the project NPV when all cashflows discounted @ 13.2%. The IRR for the project is 17.6%

We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA.

      Louise,
      I just talked to Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, Chairman of CFC (Federal Competition Commission),  and told him of our urgency
      to have our request approved in the next two weeks.
      He told me he will look into it today and will try to have it resolved asap. Our lawyers should do the follow up, but I am 
      confident we will get it done in time.

Absolutely,,,, I have talked to Steve and David about it, and we will definitely talk about origination...What I'll do is include it generically in the agenda, because Steve might have a complicated week, so if something comes up in his agenda, I'll do the talking.  We are already working with Carlos Alatorre and David Forster in the material.

Louise, about the conference for this month in Mexico. The agenda is set for the 19th in Monterrey and the 20 th in Mexico City.

We are ready to send out invitations, to around 550 customers via email. I believe the response rate to it, could be from 140 to 250 people.
The variable budget then, would be anywhere between $14,000 to $20,000, depending in the amount of material we will need to print, but we'll play it by ear and react as confirmations arrive. Costs include Room reservation, printed material, translation, and 1 hour of cocktails for our customers after each conference. 

Conferences will be held in the two "Industrial's Club", which are some of the best places in such cities. 

This is already included in this year's budget, but I wanted to let you know. 

Attached you will find the Invitation, and I included you in the Agenda to give the welcoming remarks to our customers. Let me know if it is OK with you, before sending it out.

Just to mention to you that we just closed the deal we spoke about this morning, with Grupo Alfa's petrochemical subsidiary (Alpek):    70 Contracts a month, for 21 months, Apr01-Dec03 in the Tetco-EPGT and Houston Ship Channel Indexes. This was a 14.7 BCFs and a $300,000 USD NPV'd...

So we are at about 150 BCFs and $3.6 MM.

I was at the All Employee meeting yesterday where you mentioned you had open positions in Monterrey, Mexico.

I applied for the Plant Manager position on April 26.  Since then, I have traded countless messages with Daniel Batista from Human Resources.   His latest position (June 27) was that a hiring decision could not be made as the plant was likely to be sold.

Based on your comments, I assume the plant was never sold.  I am very interested in the position and would like to schedule a confidential meeting to discuss the position in further detail.  I believe to be the right person for the job.  I am including my resume for your review.   If that position is not available I would like to explore others.

 I will enumerate some of the skills and experience that make me the person you need to hire for this job posting:

Native Spanish Speaker (born in Mexico City)
Chemical Engineer / MBA
International Operating Experience under "Difficult Conditions"
Proven builder of relationships in Latin American Business and Political arenas
Ample Process Experience
Environmental and Health and Safety Experience in Industrial Settings
Proven multidisciplinary and multicultural team builder and leader
Lives by Enron's principles and Code of Ethics
Prepared to relocate internationally

I spent the last two years in Argentina working for Azurix reporting directly to the COO.  My official title was planning manager, however, as necessities surfaced, I took over a number of other roles including day to day operations, engineering, and public relations. 

Please expect a call from me on Monday to set up an appointment.

Thanks

Mariano Gomez

Jaime Williams telephoned today to follow up on a variety of issues. He inquired about the results of the PRC for his employees which I can provide given you concur and he would like to have a copy of the analysis that was done on the contractors we had working in Mexico that he originally was interested in considering employment.  He appears to have some questions on the analysis.  Are you comfortable with me providing a copy to him?

Louise,

I want to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to talk to you about career opportunities with the Mexico Group. I understand that this is a tough time but I believe that that my experience and career can be useful to help in the developing of business in Mexico.
I worked for almost 10 year in mergers & acquisition and investment banking in Mexico before joining Enron's Mergers & Acquisition and finance Origination Group headed by Frank Stabler in the former EI / CALME. Currently, I am a Manager at the Enron Xcelerator group leading a business development project in the transportation industry. However, given the current environment at Enron, the project will unlikely be funded.
I am attaching my resume for your review and I would like to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to discuss about a potential career opportunities in your group. 
 
Thanks.

Guys, I just want to thank all of you who participated in putting together the Risk Management Conference.  We had a great response from our customers, reaching 140 attendants to the 2 events. We have seen the Comment - Sheets and the customers are very pleased with the quality of the event. They loved the material, the place and the service.  As a consequence of that, we got a lot interest in our business, not only for gas derivatives, but also for supplying power, which we are already following up.

We event got resumes from people that wanted to join our team, which speaks very well about the image we convey. 

Over the last 3 years, this Conference has set a standard in the Mexican gas derivatives business; and my special thanks go to the Risk Management Team. I urge you to keep on showing this kind of excellence in performing your job.

Best regards.

Jaime Williams.

Louise, just not to leave this item pending.  You asked me to talk to Steve and think about a differen ttitle...After hours of deliberation, I propose to you that we keep the regular US title  (Director), and we avoid any confusion. In terms of our customers I'll just tell them I am director for the Monterrey office.
Let me know if you are OK so I can immediately correct my business cards. 
Thanks and have agood weekend.

Louise,

Steve and I conferenced with Joe Galan this week.  He is heading to Washington DC for the remainder of this week.  I am planning to talk to him Monday and set something up for next week.

I sent him the Mexican bank contacts and hopefully by next week he will have a better feel for what is in the realm of do-able.  I will let you know when we plan to meet next week.

Probably didn't make myself clear enough - sorry its been a long day.  Have we thought about flipping to another developer (other than your millionaire guy),  you probably have pursued others apart from him but others may be interested  - we are finding buyers for Alamac which is surprizing.

Subject:	Re: Stealth   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Louise,

The earnings strategy of all "Stealth" projects is to sell of the majority of the equity in the project to a third party.  I don't think we know yet whether someone like Transalta would be interested in a project of this size and at this location but we would certainly welcome any and all interested buyers of the project to a selldown process.  We do think that most buyers would place a premium on their offer for the equity in these projects if financing has already occurred or is assurred, but we are  not married to the idea.    

As to the financing fees, we have assumed US$ 750,000 as a minimum up front fee a bank would charge for the project to be worth their time.  Brian Kerrigan provided me with that cost assumption for a one-off financing for a project of this size, prior to his leaving.

Thanks,


Steve

Louise & Tammie,
I want to thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent me, they are really
nice.

me the money for the painting is makingg a deposit on my mom's US account.

Name: Diana Morales de Martinez
Bank: Wells Fargo Bank Texas, N.A.
Account #027-4729060

PDT. Louise: I'm very happy that you liked your painting!! The "yellow" one
is almost finished and Tammie's painting it is ready! I'm just waiting it to
let it dry so I can send it. (those are Christmas gifts for both) Those are
on me!

Thanks again and talk to you on Monday.
Warm Regards,
Barbara

Numbers are great, we have 140 people confirmed already.  I'll do the welcome Speech, and Steve's part as well.
I'll try to get some pictures, and send them out to you.
Best regards.

Max,

I would find it doubtful that that the flight crew would test the aircraft in such a fashion, during a scheduled flight with pax aboard. Anytime there is a problem with flight control that is VERY serious. I'm glad they seemed to have handled the situation. It probably was not a VOR problem but more likely a flight control problem i.e. control surfaces, rudder, ailerons. The VOR fail message could have been due to a power down of the avionics consistent with a post emergency-landing procedure.

I have a commercial pilot certificate and have done some charter work. In addition I've flown a 757 in the simulator at United and know how many back ups those things have. They are very redundant.

I'm really glad everything turned out okay.

All the best,
Andy

Andy:

I was actually the person to whom this happened.  I was on an AeroMexico flight yesterday from Mexico City to Monterrey.  Within minutes after leaving Mexico City the plane started to hump up and down and then started fishtailing.  It is unclear whether this was something the pilot was doing to test the plane or not.  We quickly circled back to Mexico City, but came in very, very low on our approach (and seemed to be losing speed).

In any event, as I was exiting the plane, I looked into the cockpit and saw the message "VOR2  FAIL" on the center display.  Being an admitted greenhorn at these things, I didn't know what else to look for or where to look for it, so there may have been something I overlooked.

The crew was very short on details, but they appeared very rattled by all of this.  One of the flight attendants told a fellow passenger who was complaining about being late that he should simply be thankful he was still alive.  [Probably not what they teach in flight attendant school as the optimal response, but . . . . . .]

In any event, I appreciate the info below and would appreciate any additional info this message may lead you to.  I'd love to know whether or not the adrenaline surge was warranted.

Best regards - Max

Subject:	RE: On a plane

a VOR is the standard instrument for navigating an aircraft under an IFR flight plan. It is the receiver that allows the plane to be flown on bearings from ground stations. If it were to fail there would be loads of backups, although if you are on a scheduled flight their operations manual would dictate that the flight be terminated as soon as practicable in the event any primary component, such as this were to fail. Where were you that you were able to monitor the performance of this instrument ? The flight deck ?

	I met yesterday with Guillermo Vogel, CEO of Tamsa.( 110 MW).
He was interested in receiving a proposal from Enron, based on an import of power scheme.
He offered me to give us a quick response, on whether they are seriously interested.
He will be out of the country for two weeks, and told me he will be ready to review our deal then.
The steps are as follows:
			1) Mr Gustavo Rosas (from their Veracruz site) will provide all the information we require.
		                He called me today, and is preparing the information. (Mr Rosas phone no. 2989-1100 x 4006)
			2) Marc should call Mr Rosas next Monday 9, confirm all the information that I requested,
	                           and schedule a visit to Veracruz next week, since Mr Rosas wants to meet us there.
			3) Prepare a proposal with 10 and 15 years prices, that we should deliver in two weeks time. 
So far, it looks promising.
	Regards,	jaime____

Louise, thanks for your prompt response.
I am getting a fair response from our guys in Monterrey, although we have not submitted a proposal, yet.
I am loading them with information, in order for them to prepare the proposals during the next weeks.
Then, we will see how good & creative the proposals turn out.

On a different issue, I had an informal talk with Sergio Gutierrez ( David's eldest brother from DeAcero)
last week in Monterrey, over dinner. I would like to share the outcome with you, only.

Regards,	jaime____

Subject:	DESC Proposal

I had a meeting this morning with Dr. Luis Tellez (former Secretary of Energy), who is currently COO of Grupo DESC.
He is also very interested in receiving a proposal from Enron. 
They are preparing all the information we will need, and he offered to send it before the end of the week. DESC's needs
are 150 MW, in 22 separate sites. Luis wants to have a proposal by the middle of next week, in order to discuss it with
Mr. Fernando Senderos, Chairman & CEO of DESC, and his boss, who will out of the country for one month, as of July 21.
This is another opportunity that looks promising, although our proposal will be compared with others coming from a single
plant scheme ( 250 or 500 MW), where we have a disadvantage at heat rate and pricing.
I believe we have to be more creative, in the way we portrait our import scheme. Lets talk about it.

Louise, I know last thursday and friday we had difficulty buying options from customers. 
Since Friday, I have a customer (Tamsa), that wants to sell back to ENA, some South Texas Index options, for an amount close to $4.8 Million in premiums.
When do you think we can get back to normal trading ? Please advice so we can act accordingly. Best regards.

Sounds like a good idea, and I'll be happy to attend.  If it's OK with you, I'd like to schedule this for some time after the end of March.  Steve Irvin and Marc Sabine should also attend from our team.  On your voicemail message, you mentioned having a lawyer attend to speak to legal issues - if you still think that would be helpful, we should include Peggy Banczak for that purpose.

Max:

I would like to organize a Vitro project review meeting during the next several weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking.    The objective of the meeting is to ensure all related Enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions.  This will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on "technical risks" as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments.  We had a similar meeting with the Electrobolt team in Enron S. America, that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives.

Do you have a project presentation that you (and/or the lead developer) could discuss with the above team?  We could do it by phone - or better yet - the next time you are in Houston.  As many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well (e.g., commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy).

I don't mean to be sticking my nose into your deal, other than to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implemented successfully.

Let me know as to your availability,
Brian

Louise,

The earnings strategy of all "Stealth" projects is to sell of the majority of the equity in the project to a third party.  I don't think we know yet whether someone like Transalta would be interested in a project of this size and at this location but we would certainly welcome any and all interested buyers of the project to a selldown process.  We do think that most buyers would place a premium on their offer for the equity in these projects if financing has already occurred or is assurred, but we are  not married to the idea.    

As to the financing fees, we have assumed US$ 750,000 as a minimum up front fee a bank would charge for the project to be worth their time.  Brian Kerrigan provided me with that cost assumption for a one-off financing for a project of this size, prior to his leaving.

Thanks,


Steve

Louise, about the conference for this month in Mexico. The agenda is set for the 19th in Monterrey and the 20 th in Mexico City.

We are ready to send out invitations, to around 550 customers via email. I believe the response rate to it, could be from 140 to 250 people.
The variable budget then, would be anywhere between $14,000 to $20,000, depending in the amount of material we will need to print, but we'll play it by ear and react as confirmations arrive. Costs include Room reservation, printed material, translation, and 1 hour of cocktails for our customers after each conference. 

Conferences will be held in the two "Industrial's Club", which are some of the best places in such cities. 

This is already included in this year's budget, but I wanted to let you know. 

Attached you will find the Invitation, and I included you in the Agenda to give the welcoming remarks to our customers. Let me know if it is OK with you, before sending it out.

 

Best regards.

Dave,

I am still diving into the depths of Tex-Mex, but cannot see a reason not to proceed with signing the ABB amendment as described in Salsa (4), as this amendment does not cost us anything up front and extends our build option to the end of the year.

There are a number of risks associated with the Presidential Permit process, the possible imposition of an open season by FERC, relationship with CFE, BPUB infrastructure enhancements and service charge structure, etc. which we should discuss prior to waiving our Conditions Precedent under the DeAcero contract on July 31.

Note that if we sign the ABB amendment and waive the Conditions Precedent along with DeAcero on July 31, we will want to immediately issue a Pre-Notice of the Notice to Proceed in order to ensure completion within the 502 day DeAcero commitment.

Dave

               I had an hour long, fruitful meeting with Energy Secretary Martens last night. He was very supportive of our import
               project for industrials but, I did not convince him on the concept of CFE's bids (i.e. Rio Bravo IV) to be modified,
               so as to call for IPP or PPA's (imported power) indifferently.

               He gave me two solid arguments:

                - CFE (i.e. Mexico) cannot depend on imported power from the US (Texas) on a long term basis (25 years), since
                  there is no formal agreement between both countries that will support it. This is an even stronger argument after
                  the September 11th events, when the US can call for  national emergencies whenever needed. 

                  Secretary Martens shared with me the problems they faced in Baja California during the California energy crisis,
                  when Natural Gas supply was cut out, on three or four occasions, because of a State Government emergency
                  decree (i.e. supply contracts between SDGE and CFE were not honored).

               -  We are very late to request modifications on the Rio Bravo IV bid, which has been postponed for early December.
                  He offered to look into it for 2002 bids, providing the bilateral agreement is in place.
        

              Regarding the import project for industrials, he volunteered his support with TAMSA, AXA, DESC or DeACERO, since
              the concept of importing/trading power in the ERCOT market, is a good story for him to sell.

              Finally, he told me that the transmission cost methodology will be available by the end of this month (he hopes that the
              CRE will load it in its Internet Site).

              Regards,    Jaime  _______

Louise, we have been pre-paying the positions to some of our customers. Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds).
However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.
Questions:  Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ?  If so, with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ?

Best regards.

Steve, et al,

What is the status of Tex-Mex, and who are the responsible parties?  Is this an ENA project, and EES project, an EdM project, or is is joint?

There has been very little communication or coordination from EdM to date.  Word is that committments are being made by EdM, and it is not certain that those committments have been shared with those who will have to fulfill them.

Can you please clarify the situation?

Also, since Drew Tingleaf has left the company, who has been assigned to fill that role?

If Enron is going to be faced with committments on this project, it would be prudent to keep those involved informed.

Perhaps there is nothing to be concerned about, but it's better to ask now than to find we've missed something later.

Thanks!

Louise, 

The following are the differences in NPV at 13% for the Vitro project under the three different scenarios you laid out.


1.  If we keep the plant,  

Project NPV@13% :  US$ 24.0 MM

Equity Investments to Project:  US$ 52.8 MM



2.  If we sell to Enel's based on their offer as it was delivered to us on March 2 of this year

Project NPV@13% :  US$ 16.2 MM

Equity Investments to Project:  US$ 10.5 MM   (under this scenario we would fund 100% of the equity required for the project through COD but after giving 						    effect to the cash received up front by Enel, we would only be funding 20% of the equity required from Enron 						    which is equal to the US$ 10.5MM)


3.  If sell to Enel under the restructured proposal to achieve our deconsolidation and earnings objectives,

Project NPV@13% :  US$ 16.8 MM

Equity Investments to Project:  US$ 10.5 MM   (under this scenario we would fund 50% of the equity required for the project through COD but after giving effect 						     to the cash received up front by Enel, we would only be funding 20% of the equity required from Enron which is 						     equal to the US$ 10.5MM)

Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see more details on the three different scenarios.

Thanks,

Steve

Louise:

That is good news.  In Mexico and probably elsewhere in Latin America, we can use this unit for information gathering purposes in return for a quantifiable risk since O&M agreements are typically capped in terms of overall exposure.  It may be tough to break into third-party projects (assuming we would want to strategically), but at least on projects that we initiate, we can keep a handhold even after we sell down our equity stake.

Best regards - Max

Thanks.

We had reasonably good meetings with Ford and GM yesterday (Mike Curry on point for this). GM may be able to bring Delphi and Celanese to the table. Both companies are interested in further discussions. I am meeting with Enron engineers today to have a look at the practical geographic limits for power delivered across the proposed tie (displacement obviously increases the physical limit) to help identify additional target customers.

I just received the information to prepare DESC's proposal. I am sending a copy to Steve to Houston,
and the original to Marc to Monterrey, first thing tomorrow morning.
As you will see, the information is very detailed, and was prepared by Protego ( Aspe & Souza) for
DESC (they paid for the study), and Luis Tellez has asked us to keep it confidential.

Dr. Tellez main concerns, which should be reflected in our proposal, are:
	1) 10 & 15 years schemes.
	2) He wants to enjoy the benefits of price changes in the Texas Market.
	3) He does not want to be attached to a single technology (i.e. inside the fence power plant)
	    but rather enjoy the benefits (and risks) of being part of a Market.

Louise, 

Great news that you are coming to the Monterrey Conference!  
FYI, conferences in both cities are pretty full already.  We have almost 100 people confirmed for the Monterrey event, and 85 for MExico City. 
The audience is basically Finance Directors, Treasurers and Purchasing Managers of the top industries in Mexico.  We covered pretty much the whole country, so in Monterrey there are people coming from all the northern states, such as Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango, Zacatecas, Etc. 

The agenda is attached, and I'll Jump-start the conference, talk about the agenda, introduce the members of the Enron de Mexico Team that will be present, including you and then,  Suggestion: I think we should dedicate a minute of silence, in respect to the victims of last week's events.  After that, I will introduce you, and then pass you the microphone. There will be simultaneous translation so you can feel free to talk in English. 

 


Suggested talking points: 

- Review Enron's Primary Achievements in Mexico: 
	- Providing Risk Management Products for the Mexican Industry 
		- Leveraging Enron's Major Strengths and Capabilities
		- Leading provider of Natural Gas and Fuel Oil Derivatives
		- Serving the Top-200 energy-intensive private companies in Mexico
		- Providing specific products for the Mexican market
		- Helping businesses to increase thier optionality in a regulated environment
				
	- Monterrey Cogeneration Plant
		-  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
		- Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
		- Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.

Steve sent you a breifing on the Vitro Plant, in case the topic it comes up:  

The following is a brief bullet point description of the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant to incorporate intom the information you are send Louise in preparation for the conference tomorrow.

*  245 MW Cogeneration Facility located in Garcia, Nuevo Leon (about 20 miles west of Monterrey).
* Natural Gas fired GE 7FA gas turbine is the anchor piece of equipment used at the facility.
* Commercial Operations set for October 31, 2002.
* Power Purchasers are Vitro (110 MW), Imsa (90 MW), and Apasco (40 MW) under 15 year PPAs.
* Vitro subsidiary Alcali to be supplied 210 tons per hour of steam under a 15 year SPA.
* Transmission and Distribution of the electricity to be provided by the CFE.
* Natural Gas to be provided by PGPB (Pemex).
* Financing provided by the Inter-American Development Bank.
* Major Equipment Foundations have been completed at the Construction Site, and equipment is beginning to be placed on the foundations.
* The offtakers of energy from this plant are expected to save over US$ 400 MM over the term of the 15 year agreements

A couple of other things to note are to the extent the project comes up, all Enron people should refer to the project as the Monterrey Cogeneration Plant and not the Vitro plant so as not to diminish Imsa and Apasco, and to the extent we are questioned on the sell-down of the equity the response there is that initiative, while not finalized, is being pursued to manage Enron's balance sheet and that Enron will continue to maintain a significant equity interest in the facility.

Team:

ABB will be here on Thursday, April 26 at 9:00am.  My recommendation is that Ozzie and I start out with them and perhaps pull Louise in at some point to show the flag.  Scott - we'll pull you in before we make any scheduling or engineering decisions - so if you could remain flexible for that period it would be greatly appreciated.

Steph - if you could please get us a room through lunch at least.  Thanks.

Drew,
I spoke with Svante this AM and he and Lars would like to visit with you and the
team on Thursday 26 April 01 9:00 AM.  I think that they plan to fly in Wed.
evening, I will pick them up at the airport and take them to dinner.
We will come to your offices to discuss where the project is at this time, where
Enron expects it to go, what we can do to continue to support your efforts.  We
will look at options that are beneficial to both Enron and ABB regarding
schedule, whatever that may be in the future considering work load for all
concerned.  We will also will discuss some method (even a handshake) to keep the
contract in place so that we do not have to go through a negotiation next time.

Please let us know if there are any other issues that you would like to discuss,
we will be prepared.  Look forward to seeing you then.

MIKE

I had a meeting this morning with Dr. Luis Tellez (former Secretary of Energy), who is currently COO of Grupo DESC.
He is also very interested in receiving a proposal from Enron. 
They are preparing all the information we will need, and he offered to send it before the end of the week. DESC's needs
are 150 MW, in 22 separate sites. Luis wants to have a proposal by the middle of next week, in order to discuss it with
Mr. Fernando Senderos, Chairman & CEO of DESC, and his boss, who will out of the country for one month, as of July 21.
This is another opportunity that looks promising, although our proposal will be compared with others coming from a single
plant scheme ( 250 or 500 MW), where we have a disadvantage at heat rate and pricing.
I believe we have to be more creative, in the way we portrait our import scheme. Lets talk about it.

MEXICO

-	Power strike set for March 16 in Mexico City

Some 35,000 members of the Mexican Union of Electrical Workers plan to strike the Mexico City Electric Company on Friday, March 16th at 12 Noon. The union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing. The two sides are not even talking. The union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements. The union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors. The company principally provides electrical service to Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Morelos, Hidalgo and Puebla. It may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions. (Pinkerton, March 14, 2001)

I am back in the office this morning after a week's vacation. I will get the facts and get back with you.  Confirmations have been prepared in Houston all along for the Monterrey office.  After the Doorstep review, we designated a specific point person here in Houston to be the primary liasion with the Monterrey office.  That individual is bilingual, a key factor in choosing him for the role.  I will get back with you later today.  

Who should be our primary contact in Monterrey now that Max has joined the PUC?  --Sally

Can you do me a favour and check into the back office work done in Houston for Mexico, it appears that there are some delays on execution of agreements which I believe the confirms group is supposed to do.  They only have 53 deals this year so its not many.  Is Houston the best place to do this bearing in mind language and cultural issues.  I realize it was moved from Mexico following a doorstop but the Monterrey office is very concerned about the back log.

Thanks

Have a good trip to Monterrey.  I hope that these bullet points help in your discussions tomorrow.  --Sally 


?	Gordon Heaney (Houston) was named as the Operations liasion for the Monterrey office after the Doorstep Review during the first quarter.  He is fluent in Spanish.  Confirmations have been prepared in Houston since the inception of the Mexico business.  

?	Since that time, Gordon and his boss, Joe Hunter (Manager over Derivatives Confirmations), have made a trip to Monterrey to meet the commercial team and to iron out the process flow for confirmations. 

?	Gordon and Joe meet with Agustin Perez and Jaime Williams when they are in Houston for bid week each month. 

?	Last meeting with Agustin and Jaime was last week here in Houston.  Primary focus of the conversation was around involving the commercial team in working with counterparties to get executed confirmations back in our hands.  Our commitment is to get a spreadsheet to Agustin and Jaime each week that details unexecuted confirmations and responses, or lack thereof, from the counterparties.  That way the commercial teams can push with their commercial contacts and Gordon can push with his contacts for executed confirmations.  The first of these spreadsheets was sent to the Monterrey office today, per the commitment from Gordon and Joe last week.  

Creation of confirmations:  Timing has improved since first quarter, as 25 to 30% of the deals are now done with counterparties who have recently executed ISDA master agreements.  Confirmations for deals done with these counterparties are being sent Trade Date + 1.  For counterparties without master agreements in place, there are often special riders to the confirmations with input required from Credit and Legal.  These confirmations naturally take longer and are going out to the counterparties sometime after Trade Date + 1.  I have asked Joe and Gordon to diligently push Credit and Legal to complete this process more promptly.  

Execution of confirmations:  We have found that the counterparties in Mexico are more interested in having the invoice in hand as their documentation on a deal than in returning a signed  confirmation to us.  This is an education process that we will continue to work on with the help of the commercial team in Monterrey.  

My opinion:  Let's try the weekly spreadsheet status on unexecuted confirmations for a few weeks and monitor progress.  It is my opinion that there is not the depth of business yet in the Monterrey office to warrant a fulltime confirmations person located there.  I think that the bilingual contact here working closely with the commercial team in Monterrey will make a difference.

Brian,

It looks like we should be able to cover Vitro with the people in Virgo's group.  Robert Rimbau is currently very involved, and can stay involved and we can bring Dave Kristich if needed.  

As we discussed, pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, we need to contact Tractebel as soon as anyone listed on the schedule is unavailable.  Do you have the contact info for Tractebel?

Thanks,

Don

Louise, I know that Steve has brought this up with the folks who are working the Vitro selldown.  In other words we are not banking on a single entity to make this happen, we are considering other buyers.

Probably didn't make myself clear enough - sorry its been a long day.  Have we thought about flipping to another developer (other than your millionaire guy),  you probably have pursued others apart from him but others may be interested  - we are finding buyers for Alamac which is surprizing.

Subject:	Re: Stealth   

Louise,

The earnings strategy of all "Stealth" projects is to sell of the majority of the equity in the project to a third party.  I don't think we know yet whether someone like Transalta would be interested in a project of this size and at this location but we would certainly welcome any and all interested buyers of the project to a selldown process.  We do think that most buyers would place a premium on their offer for the equity in these projects if financing has already occurred or is assurred, but we are  not married to the idea.    

As to the financing fees, we have assumed US$ 750,000 as a minimum up front fee a bank would charge for the project to be worth their time.  Brian Kerrigan provided me with that cost assumption for a one-off financing for a project of this size, prior to his leaving.

Thanks,


Steve

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

Best regards, 
Paul

Louise, just to give you a quicmk up date...  This past couple of weeks, we have traded the following: 

Volume:	5.43 BCF's
Origination:	$163,500
Our total numbers to date are : $3.0 Mill, and 126 BCFs.
The number of trades has slowed down a bit as we expected, but we've been pretty busy following up with Deemed ISDAs and Master Agreements.
We have received in the last 2 weeks 8 executed long confirmations, and are working with legal and our customers with a list of long confirms. 

I would like to talk to you regarding other deals we have been pursuing with other groups, and get some feedback from you.  I'll call you. 

Best regards.

Schedule 7.1 list the "Sundance B Power Purchase Agreement" as an asset that Enron can sell.  However, to quote the document, "provided that the party proposing to take such action has provided the other party with advance notice of the proposed action to the extent practicable". The net result is that they can't stop you since it is listed, but we do need to notify them.  Sorry for any confusion.

We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA. 

Best regards.

Brian,
 
It occurred to me that we haven't spoken about the ongoing management/oversite of the construction of the Vitro project in light of next week's expected events.  While we have discussed EEOS's role with Tractebel, we need to keep in mind that we need a technical person to monitor the construction process to protect Enron's remaining 20% interest.  I believe Steve Irvin had planned on using Robert Rimbau.  Unsure if Robert works for you or Virgo, but regardless, Enron needs someone to monitor the construction process.
 
Secondly, also keep in mind that we are technically still on the hook to be the operator of the project.  While we are working with Tractebel to transition out of the operating role, we haven't yet completed the transition.  We want to make sure that we don't breach any agreement with the IDB.
 
Let's talk as soon as possible to make sure that we have these issues adequately covered.  We probably need to engage Steve Irvin as well.  I am unsure of his status, but I will check with Louise.
 
Thanks,
 
Don

I guess by your response, Bob's group (or some subset) remains intact?  If so, we can cover with his group.  Rimbau may be in his group already. 
 
Does the Mexican group survive?  Given the circumstances, we should consider going to Tractebel and see if we can go ahead sell them the entire project. I bet the IDB would be glad to be rid of us!
 
Let's talk on Monday when you get a chance.
 
Don

Max:

I would like to organize a Vitro project review meeting during the next several weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking.    The objective of the meeting is to ensure all related Enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions.  This will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on "technical risks" as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments.  We had a similar meeting with the Electrobolt team in Enron S. America, that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives.

Do you have a project presentation that you (and/or the lead developer) could discuss with the above team?  We could do it by phone - or better yet - the next time you are in Houston.  As many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well (e.g., commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy).

I don't mean to be sticking my nose into your deal, other than to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implemented successfully.

Let me know as to your availability,
Brian

Title: Mexican Power Markets: CFE Looks to Industrial Generators for Excess Power, but Many Questions Remain    
URL(s): 

<http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2603;> 


*********************************************************************** 

SURPLUS INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY COULD RELIEVE MEXICO'S SUMMER POWER SHORTAGE 

Power plants being built under the Comision Reguladora de Energia's (CFE) 
Independent power producer program will not be available until the end of the 
year, leaving a very tight market during the summer peak demand season. 
President Vicente Fox recently announced that the CFE would increase the 
capacity that industrial generators could sell back to the national grid. The 
initiative was met with resistance by many members of Mexico's Congress, 
however, and has been suspended pending judicial review. The success of the 
program will depend on three factors: 

*  Is there enough surplus capacity available where it is needed? 

*  Is the CFE willing to offer an attractive price? 

*  Will the courts allow it to happen?

John and Louise, I just want to inform you that last friday, we reached our 2001 Volume and Origination targets for Risk Management trades in Mexico.  We have been marketing financial derivatives to industrial customers in Mexico, and aggressively expanding our cutomer base, and it is finally paying off.
Our targets for this year were: To reach a volume of 84 Bcfs of Natural Gas equivalent trades, and Origintaion of  $1.9 Million dollars.

Today, we have 98 Bcfs of gas, and $2.130  Million dollars in origination. Our efforts to expand this market will not ease, but we are very happy for this results down here, and wanted to share this with you. 

Best regards.
