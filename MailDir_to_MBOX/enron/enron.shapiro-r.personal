Rick:

The California team has been working tirelessly for months on end to protect Enron's business interests and good name under tremendously challenging circumstances.  As a shareholder, I appreciate the team's individual and collective efforts.  Your message is obviously heart-felt, and appropriately recognizes the important work that has been (and continues to be) done.  That kind of recognition is what inspires people to keep on keeping on.  

Lisa

First of all, welcome back!  I have always been proud to be part of the "Ken Lay team."  

I felt compelled to write this note to you after listening to the questions you received at this morning's meeting.  I have worked for the FERC and several large energy companies, and, in my opinion, none of these companies treat their employees as well as Enron.   All in all, we have it very good here at Enron.

I agree that we have outstanding leadership talent at Enron.  I report directly to Rick Shapiro, and I have never had a boss that I respect more than Rick.  He embraces the visions and values that you talked about this morning.

Thank you for your loyalty to our company, and to its employees.   

Best regards,

Lisa

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Dear Rick,

In September, I started a new job with another electric cooperative in North
Alabama near Decatur and Huntsville. It is Joe Wheeler EMC, a TVA
distributor. We have about 39,000 customers in 2 counties south of
Huntsville. This had been a troubled cooperative and had seen a huge
management and board shake-up. I hope that between my efforts and having a
few new board members that things will smooth out here.

I am sure saddened to see all of the stuff hit the fan at Enron. I had
actually bought more stock several weeks ago in the belief that this whole
thing was a fluke. I like many others are reminded that the market is a very
fickle animal indeed. I hope that you and the old group are being seen as
part of the core business. I don't think that anyone would say that ENE did
not have an effective government relations group.

Best Wishes,
George Kitchens
General Manager & CEO

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

This is very well done.  It's great that you let people know that the work =
they do is worthwhile and appreciated.  Some days it's hard (for everyone, =
I think) to remember that that is the case.

nificant difference to the 18,000 Enron employees and their families...Each=
 of you, in the context of the broad "campaign" to communicate the rightnes=
s of our perspective and to protect the good name of the company and indivi=
duals within the company, has put forth a great effort that has been perfor=
med with excellence and that has made a significant and positive difference=
....and that has succeeded in many respects thus far....I understand the ef=

Subject:=09The aftermath of September 11th -- Enron Government Affairs


    The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will conti=
nue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have=
 not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themse=
lves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance =
for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( =
until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently  uncomfortable =
with the notion of air travel  need not do so...we will work around this fo=
r as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on =
the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please=
 contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information.
     A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of =
September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out =
in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our "group"=
,both in London and at home,  over the last nine days , including( to a per=
son) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in =
our group who is an "Arab American" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim. My high rega=
rd and respect for the Government Affairs group and for each individual  ha=
s been validated many times over  during the past nine days. Thank you very=
 much.--- Rick Shapiro

A follow-on to Janel's comments: I wanted to comment a bit on the " Califor=

 efforts, and the work that continues: While I may be properly, and not sur=
prisingly, characterized as "non-practicing"(in a formal religious sense), =
I do believe quite firmly that what we do in life( and how we do it) echoes=
 through eternity...it is the effort and the quality of the effort in all t=

rk that cannot be equated with the work of people, past and present, such a=
s Mother Teresa, the work we do is good, very good in fact, and makes a sig=
nificant difference to the 18,000 Enron employees and their families...Each=
 of you, in the context of the broad "campaign" to communicate the rightnes=
s of our perspective and to protect the good name of the company and indivi=
duals within the company, has put forth a great effort that has been perfor=
med with excellence and that has made a significant and positive difference=
....and that has succeeded in many respects thus far....I understand the ef=

Subject:	Show Cause order info

Please provide comments on the draft show cause order by COB Monday 9/10.  There may be a revised version out later today with Steve W. and some other comments incorporated after yesterday's phone call.  Final draft should be ready Tues. or Wed. and we will have a conference call late Wed afternoon to finalize.  It can then be shopped at FERC (Linda/Sarah -- can you gather a list of who to contact at FERC?)  Also, Steve and Rick will take it to the Commissioner meetings on 9/17.  

We want to have some press coverage when we file (Janel to handle?)
Paul is going to clear this with PGE deal folks
Paul needs to give a heads up to Western govs when we file
We can provide it the day before or day of filing to some groups:  Ideas
-EPSA
-ELCON, Steel group, etal. (filed this week to support FERC mandating a single Midwest RTO)
-Nat'l Rural Elec. Coop (Glenn English recently gave a speech requesting a fully integrated grid)
-These groups filed to make Alliance get an independent board (Janine-would they be helpful?):  Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers, Industrial Energy Users-Ohio; WVa Energy Users Group; Assoc. of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity; Citizens Action Coalition of Ind; Izaak Walton League of North America; Environmental Law and Policy Center
-Some coops and munis represented by Speigal and McDiarmid in DC and Miller Balis & ONeill in DC (EPMI signed on to their filing against the NC PUC's request for stay of the SE RTO mediation)

Contains Steve's comments                        << File: EnronReq-Notes(SLW).DOC >>          plus, we are changing the MBRs test to state that OATT is not enough to mitigate transmission market power -- need to agree to join RTO as finally ordered per 7/12 orders.  Thanks

Subject:	My trip


I'm not sure I said it at all, but clearly did'nt say it often enough...each of you and many others around you do a remarkable job under difficult and demanding circumstances. With each trip to Brazil, I gain more respect for each of you and the personal and professional sacrifices you make...more than ever should have to be demanded. Your respective commitments to Enron are quite amazing. The best part about Brazil has been getting to know each of you and thinking of each of you, not only as professional colleagues, but also as friends.
    With your continuing efforts, I am quite confident that the company will ultimately be far better off because  of your presence and  respective efforts. While my contributions over the the last two years to Enron South America are few and pale in comparison to each of yours, I want to be of assistance where I can- please feel free to call upon me whenever I can be of help. Thanks again for for great work and efforts. See you again soon.

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed our visit and remain very interested in the opportunity at El Paso. I believe I can make a difference and build a merchant regulatory function that will add value and be respected in the industry. Feel free to call Steve Kean at 713-853-1586. I'd also be happy to give you some additional names. Thanks again.

Great - I will look forward to meeting you both.  Give me a call when you get to the hotel - cell is 914-419-6490 - and we can find a place to meet in the hotel.  I usually get upgraded to a suite, so if that is the case, it is more discreet to meet there.

Thanks.
 
By the way, thank you also for the message you sent to the group about yesterday's events.  One person in our group remarked to me that getting that message was like getting a "much needed hug".

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Thanks a lot Rick. Those words were really encouraging and I hope my survival instincts give me all the courage to face the future !!!. Read your mail on the California Campaign Closeout. Felt very nice on reading it. Gives me a very good feeling for being a part of the team and for being able to contribute in whatever small way I could.

Rick,

Just to keep you informed. The first batch of 23 folks have received severances and the next list is expected around mid- to  end-September. I am still around !!!!! Working with and keeping Amr posted with developments here.

I hope things are going fine in California. Keep on reading the news articles and so feverishly hope a long lasting and mutually beneficial solution would emerge for the Company.

Rick - I know I don't leave until the end of the week, but I'm feeling cont=
emplative and wanted to take a moment and thank you for all the opportunity=
 and support you have given me over the years.  Although I wish I was leavi=
ng the company better than when I found it, I can't help but feel grateful =
all the same for the experiences and friendships I have made here.  I look =
over the past 3 1/2 years with amazement over the things and people I was e=
xposed to -   the political conventions, the group off-sites, the trip to I=
ndia, the Inauguration (okay, I could have lived without the Inauguration).=
  But all of these things I would never have had a chance to experience wit=
hout Enron and the encouragement of you.  I learned so much here that I wil=
l have to draw upon for the rest of my life.  And the friends I have made a=
nd colleagues I have known have all had a tremendous impact on me.  I have =
never worked in an environment that had such high-quality people.  I owe yo=
u a lot, and I hope you know that no matter how hard things may have gotten=
, or how difficult some decisions may have been for you, you have never let=
 me down and I have always held you in the highest regard.

I have wrapped up about all that I can here and had my exit interview today=
.  I will be taking finals next week and then spend some much needed time w=
ith my family.  But I'm definitely here for you if you need anything, and I=
 am hoping for the best for Enron and its people.

 of you, in the context of the broad "campaign" to communicate the rightnes=

It's always been hard to determine what is essential vs. nonessential trave=

    The events of September 11th are still very much with us and will conti=
nue to be for some time, perhaps for as long as we live. For those who have=
 not heard me say this regarding air travel,individuals should avail themse=
lves of the travel services the company is offering in the way of guidance =
for those that are traveling and only travel by air for essential matters( =
until further notice). In addition, anyone who is currently  uncomfortable =
with the notion of air travel  need not do so...we will work around this fo=
r as long as the need exists. The company has also provided information on =
the availability of counseling services should anyone have the need- please=
 contact HR or the Benefits Group for further information.
     A final couple of notes: If there is a silver lining in the events of =
September 11th, it is the kindness, generosity, and humanity it brings out =
in the rest of us...I have seen this play out in untold ways in our "group"=
,both in London and at home,  over the last nine days , including( to a per=
son) the absence of any hint of bias being shown towards the individual in =
our group who is an "Arab American" and a Muslim, Amr Ibrahim. My high rega=
rd and respect for the Government Affairs group and for each individual  ha=
s been validated many times over  during the past nine days. Thank you very=
 much.--- Rick Shapiro

Rick, et al:

Thank you so much for such a special evening.  I really enjoyed dinner, and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you.  It meant a lot to me that you were willing to give up an evening with your family to wish me well.  

It has truly been a privilege to work with such talented colleagues (as Amr would say).  I will miss working with you, and I will miss your friendship.  

Thanks again.

Lisa

Hi Rick,

Thanks for your kind note.  I know I really appreciated it, and I'm sure ev=
eryone else does, too.

I just talked with Ginger and she mentioned that Amy is travelling this wee=
k, too, and won't be able to get home from Pittsburgh until Friday.  I'm su=
re it must be hard for both of you to be away from the boys at this time.  =
Eric is planning to call your house to see if there's anything we can do to=
 help while you're away.  Our kids would love to have Ben and Jonathan over=
 to play any time.  Please encourage your mother-in-law and your au pair to=
 let us know if there's anything we can do to help.

Take care,

Sue

Speaking for the Californians, we have not doubted the rightness of our arguments for a minute.  We've been proud to represent Enron, even if some of you at corporate cannot travel in our fair state without donning false mustaches, and continue to advocate with heart.  Its been an exciting ride, and it ain't over yet.  Thanks for the opportunity to fight the good fight with a group of very impressive professionals who've managed to keep some sense of humor during our darkest days.

Rick:
It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.  Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.  Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.  And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Talk to you soon.  Keep hanging in there.

Best,
Jeff

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I wanted to let you know how much your note to all of us meant to me.  I shared it with my husband and his response was "What a mensch!"  That was perfect.  You are that.  I was horrified to hear from Ginger today that your wife was also away from home.  I can't imagine that -- I would have been terrorized. It's good to hear she may be getting home today.  I hope you're doing OK.  We look forward to your safe return.

Sue

Gentlemen. I am writing to let you know that I have recently been appointed
as president and COO of all of GPC's operations ouside of Canada and the US.
So please let me know if I can help in any foreign markets at all. You will
recall my/GPC's work for Enron on Project Stanley here in Canada.

On another matter, If in anyway we can help you on the current situation
regarding market confidence let me know. I would be more than willing to put
together of our  best people in GPC Fleishman Hillard or Omnicom to come
down and brain storm about media relations, investor communications or
anything else.

Good luck.

Rick--I have been thinking of you often during these trying times.   The range of emotions you must be experiencing must be so trying--you put your heart and soul into fighting the good fight and to see the results of your great effort slipping away must be virtually unbearable.

In any event,  it would be my great pleasure to spend some time talking over your plans.   What does Tuesday at lunch look like?  I'll be in meetings on Monday,  but please call Dorothy Barnes at 713.331.1266 and work out a time with her.   She knows I want to talk to you.  I'm looking forward to our visit.

HI Rick. Hadn't seen this before I talked to you this morning.  I would sen=

Have fun with your kids tonight--I am going to a party at my god daughters =

 big chili dinner and drink lots of wine and cider while we wait for them t=

Hi Rick,

I'm responding to your very nice voicemail message in writing because I seem to have less control over my emotions these days than I would like.  I cannot tell you how much I appreciate everything you have done for me.  I continue to hold you in the very highest regard professionally and as a friend.  I can honestly say that I have no regrets over the decisions that I have made.  Working with you (and for Enron) has given me opportunities to expand professionally and personally that I never would have had otherwise.  Also, the move to Texas has opened new horizons for my family and taught us that we can be happy in settings very different from what we had known before.

Like you, I wish with all my heart that things had worked out differently.  It would be wonderful to continue to work with you--here or elsewhere.  Whatever comes, I'm greatful for all of the good things that have come my way so far.  Thanks again for everything.  You are an amazing person and an amazing friend.

Sue

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Rick - Thanks for the note. The reduction in budget to $9.4 million is
indeed dramatic, but appears to be necessary under the circumstances. We
continure to be optimistic also, but I certainly understand the need to be
realistic. Hope you have gotten some rest and I look forward to speaking
with you next week. Ken (P.S. you and Steve Kean and the rest of your
government affairs team can be proud of all you have accomplished in
advocating deregulation in natural gas and power markets in the US and
abroad!)

Hello Rick.  I didn't get a chance to tell you in person - Thank You.  It meant alot to me and I'm sure everyone else on how you handled Enron's "issues" and the Sept. 11th event.  I think this showed to me your true compassion and explains the loyalty that your employees have for you.  

When I grow up, I want to be just like you.  :-)  

Again, Thanks and it was very much appreciated.

Melinda

Hi Rick:

Thank you for the kind message that you left on my voicemail on Friday 
evening.  I apologize that I got choked up when I was leaving.  Saying 
goodbye to good friends is not easy.

This is my new personal email address.  Please drop me a line every now and 
then to let me know how you're doing.

I hope to see you soon.

Lisa

Rick:  I don't even know if I can say goodbye to you.  I know you're not supposed to admit these kinds of things, but I'm not sure I can say goodbye without getting emotional.  I truly care about you, and I will watch your back wherever I am.

Rick, et al:

Thank you so much for such a special evening.  I really enjoyed dinner, and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you.  It meant a lot to me that you were willing to give up an evening with your family to wish me well.  

It has truly been a privilege to work with such talented colleagues (as Amr would say).  I will miss working with you, and I will miss your friendship.  

Thanks again.

Lisa

Thank you for the note below. =20

You've taken the brunt of this since the first inkling of bad news.  I unde=
rstand that on the call last Friday, the group thanked you for keeping us a=
ll informed and together.  I wish that I could have been on the call to joi=
n with the rest of the group in expressing those thanks to you.

Enron has been, and for some hopefully will continue to be, a wild ride.  B=
eing part of your group has made the ride really, really, fun and rewarding=
. =20

Beth, Lily and I hope you and your family enjoy the holiday.   We'll be ove=
r the mountains at our house in Black Butte.  We're out of pager range, but=
 the cell phone works fine if you need to reach me re:  anything Dynegy or =
PGE. =20

Take care. =20

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Hello Rick. I didn't get a chance to tell you in person - Thank You. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; It meant alot to me and I'm sure everyone else on how you handled 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Enron's "issues" and the Sept. 11th event. I think this showed to me 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; your true compassion and explains the loyalty that your employees have

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; When I grow up, I want to be just like you. :-)

for your very balanced and clear speech yesterday afternoon. This was not an easy exercise. The name of the European Dynegy government affairs guy (you referred to) is DAVID KEAN. David has roughly 5 people in his group in Richmond. 

Best regards

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Rick, thanks for your compassion, candour, and integrity through this proce=
ss. Your management of this crises represents for me the very essence of th=
e Enron that I believed in. If the truth be told, we indeed have a lot to b=
e thankful for - the opportunity to work with great people and to work for =
what was a great company. I pray that inspite of all that has happened, you=
r heart will be filled with thankful praise at this season of thanksgiving.

Regards,
Gloria
