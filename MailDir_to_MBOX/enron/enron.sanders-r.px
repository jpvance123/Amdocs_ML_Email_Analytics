Two items: 

1) Tracy Ngo called to elaborate on the six offsets referenced in footnotes C, F & H which total $1,002,430.57.    The collateral referenced in the spreadsheet is gross or prior to these offsets.    I adjusted the collateral and overcollateralization downward to reflect these offsets in the table immediately below.
2) The $36 million in collateral for the CAISO displayed reflects collateral for ongoing scheduling coordinator activities.   EMPI must maintain this going forward.

Evidently I misunderstood my marching orders.  Richard Sanders just called to advise me that any vote on an arbitration demand was within his bailiwick and that he was adamantly opposed to the committee making a demand or commencing any other action against SCE at this time.  I apologize for my misunderstanding and wanted to correct the record immediately.  Needless to say, Enron at this time also opposes expenditure of time by committee counsel to prepare papers in connection with any arbitration demand.

                                         Orders





As many of you know, Judge Montali entered orders on July 11, 2001
respecting Pg&E's Rule 2004 requests made to CALISO and CALPX. I have not
yet received copies of the entered orders. Nonetheless, his orders provide
that Market Participants, through their outside counsel, may request copies
of the ISO and PX production, following procedures set forth in the orders.
In general the orders provide that:
     -- a  Market Participant who desires to have its outside counsel
receive a copy of the ISO document production must submit a request that is
received by ISO's counsel, David Neale, of Levene, Neale, Bender, Rankin &
Brill, LLP, 1801 Avenue of the Stars, suite 1120, LA, CA 90067, no later
than July 18, 2001. Copies of the requests must be served upon bankruptcy
counsel for PG&E, the PX, and the PX Committee. The requesting Market
Participant shall bear the costs of duplication and shipment of the ISO
Document Production. The request must also be accompanied by a
certification from outside counsel stating that the outside counsel agrees
to be bound by the terms of the Order, directing that shipment be made by
overnight courier to the address of the outside counsel, agreeing to pay
for the costs of duplication and shipment on behalf of the Market
Participant and providing a client billing number for invoicing purposes.
     --a Market Participant who desires to have its outside counsel receive
a copy of the PX Document Production follows a similar procedure, except
that the counsel for the PX is Dan Sedor of Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &
Marmaro LLP, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, 10th floor, Los Angeles Ca 90067, no
later than July 25, 2001. Service must be made additionally upon the ISO
bankruptcy counsel.
     If you need a copy of the orders and/or the ceritications, please
contact Maureen Franks (mfranks@kayescholer.com). Again, I don't have the
entered orders but I do have the latest versions which were submitted to
the Court.
     Finally, if the deadlines are missed, one of the orders do provide
that upon request by a Market Participant, the Custodian (as that term is
defined in the orders) for the PX Committee may disclose the produced
information to Outside Professionals (as that term is defined in the
orders).

Ray --

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter the=
y appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to buyers or =
they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.=09Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these proceeding=
 the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be addressed.  CalPX pr=
oposes to use its share-fraction allocation method to determine how to spre=
ad the refunds among its participants if there are no specific Commission o=
rders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar provision=
 in its tariff.

Ron,

Attached is a more refined version of the affidavit. Also attached is a
short to do list.  The most notable item on it, which we may not have
discussed of recent, is that Mary wanted someone in Tim's organization
to work on the harm to commercial interests aspect.  Also, not noted at
all is that this needs some sort of review to ensure I'm not including
anything inappropriate.

I'm going to be out for the mid part of today.  Can we touch base on the
process from here on out?

Thanks,
Ellen.

You all should have Mary Hain's original analysis.  Bracewell Patterson has 
reviewed her analysis and agrees.  It looks to me like we may have some 
procedural firepower here as well.  I have been working the last few days 
crafting a response to Dave Germaine's letter.  I have been working with 
Ellen Banaghan from Tabors Caramanis and Associates -- I think we are close 
to boiling our rather technical explanation into a digestable story.  
Depending on how Greg's efforts set up meetings with Sladoje and Germaine, we 
should have a strategy call soon.

Subject: Comments on Mary Hain's Memo



I've attached our comments on Mary's analysis of the PX's authority re: the 
Silver Peak Line investigation.  As you will see, we agree with Mary's 
analysis, subject to minor quibbles that do not affect the conclusion, that 
EPMI should not be found to have violated the literal terms of the PX's 
tariff, that the PX has no sanction authority over this matter, and that 
publication of the Compliance Unit's findings would be inappropriate.

We would, however, take a harder line on the proposed compromise.  In our 
view, we should insist that the PX never publicly link EPMI to the events of 
Mary 24-25.  Thus, we should agree to support a tariff filing by the PX to 
clean-up the loophole in its tariff revealed by these events, as long as the 
tariff filing does not mention either EPMI or these events as the basis for 
the filing.

Richard,

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficulties in calculating PX refunds.  

1.  The PX claims it is a "neutral party in this proceeding" and is only a conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  The CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  The PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead and hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money.  

2.  Page 3, SC Data.  I was unaware that the CalPX acted as SC until February 28th---one month after it closed the doors on January 31st.  During this time, the CAISO was probably in violation of its Tariff, which requires SCs to be creditworthy.

3.  Page 5.  Commandeered contracts.  What is the status of the PX's claim against the State of California?  The State owes the PX, as representative for its Participants, the mark-to-market value of the contracts on January 31st, less amounts paid by CDWR to suppliers.  If the PX won't bring this claim, its bankruptcy trustee or the PX Participants should bring this claim against the State of Califonria.

4.  Pages 3 and 4.  $150 Breakpoint.  I asked Kit Blair in Volume Management to review this letter and he said that it was his view and the view of two other folks in VM that the PX is vastly overstating the difficulty in calculating the $150 breakpoint.  His view was that it should take hours or days, but not weeks.  However, I do not see how we get an advantage from accelerating the calculation of refunds.

Finally, according to reports from Credit and VM, the remaining PX employees are not exactly the "A-team."   I suggest we should ask FERC to require the PX to document its methodology for calculating refunds, so that we can review for errors.  Spot audits by independent auditors might be a good idea, too.

Steve

This is being sent on behalf of Bryant Delgadillo.

It appears that some of you did not receive the attached the first time.

Dear Committee Member,

Some minor revisions were made to the draft arbitration demand letter which
was circulated last week.  Please note the following changes:

Page 1, 1st Paragraph:

"Southern California Edison ("SCE") has failed to pay more than $800
million for electricity that it contracted to purchase through the
California Power Exchange Corporation ("PX").  SCE and its parent Edison
International have admitted owing this debt in numerous public filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Yet, SCE publicly announced that
it owes nothing.  SCE has refused all efforts to discuss payment and, in
recent meetings responded with threats of litigation.  The PX has been left
with no alternative except to commence arbitration to establish the amount
due and to collect the debt."

Page 2, 4th Paragraph:
"As a result of defaults by SCE and the largest investor-owned utility PG&E
Corp., the PX filed bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 on March 9, 2001,
case No. LA-01-16577-ES.  Pursuant to order of the bankruptcy court,
entered on June 29, 2001, the Official Committee of Participant Creditors
of the PX was authorized to prosecute this action in the name of the PX.
The PX is pursuing this arbitration for the benefit of its participants and
the PX does not intend to preclude, waive or prejudice any effort by any
participant that may choose to pursue its own claim on its own behalf."

I also have attached a revised version for your convenience.

At the hearing today before Judge Kuhl, she ordered the coordination, but
has set Sacramento as the venue.

She took the bench with that as her tentative, pointing to the second
paragraph of Govt. C. 955, which provides the state the opportunity to
remove non-takings cases to Sacramento -- an argument that the State did
NOT make.  She also mentioned that the State's action in Sacramento is the
only one that attempted to bring in all of the parties.  She found that the
convenience to the parties was not significant, since they seemed to be all
over.  She also found that the matter could be sent back from Sacramento if
the judge, after completing the legal issues, felt that trials in SF or LA
would be better.

George argued for CalPX.  Linda Callison argued for PG&E, stating their
preference of SF, but LA over Sacramento.  Reliant and Williams argued for
LA.  Richard Williams argued for the State.  We went through a couple of
rounds with very little questioning by the judge.  The only issue that
caught her attention was George's argument that CCP 401(2) provides that a
party sued by the state can remove the action to their county for trial, as
long as the AG has an office there.  She questioned the interplay between
that section and the one she cited, but did not take up George's offer to
brief the issue.

Because her decision seemed to be without any serious reason, it was out of
character for her, suggesting that other issues were at play.  She broke
the argument at one point to suggest that all of the arguments about where
the property was located were really cover for the underlying reality that
all of the parties had reasons to like or hate particular judges in the
various venues that they were trying to get or avoid.  We speculate that
the judges in the LA complex panel did not want this one and she is sending
it elsewhere.  We don't think it is political, since she is no friend of
Gray Davis.

Richard,  my comments on the August 10 PX letter, having participated in th=
e August 13 and September 5 prehearing conferences:

Cal PX has always asserted its neutrality in the prehearing conferences in =
the CA proceeding.  Although this assertion is only partially true, I think=
 we would be barking up the wrong tree if we were to pursue the PX, given S=
teve's correct assessment that the PX is judgment proof.=20

My comments regarding the numbered paragraphs of the letter:

1.=09Regarding confidentiality, there is a protective order (as amended) in=
 place.  Despite this, my educated guess is that the protective order could=
 very well be lifted given the rather political nature of the proceeding.  =
Judge Birchman alluded to this possibility just yesterday at the prehearing=
 conference.  He has also previously expressed a belief that the conduct of=
 the proceeding could be hampered if each party's refund data is deemed to =
be confidential.  In short, I believe there will be less confidentiality ra=
ther than more.

2.-3.=09The PX is severely resource constrained.  Additionally the PX must =
await the ISO data before it can start generating the data that the PX itse=
lf needs to produce.  As of yesterday, the PX did not have all the ISO data=
, and the data they did receive from ISO was riddled with errors.  This gav=
e rise to the one month delay in the hearing schedule that the Judge ordere=
d yesterday.  As to the $150 breakpoint issue, I understand that it should =
not be as difficult to calculate as the PX purports, but the PX truly is un=
derstaffed and has virtually no funds.  In any case, this probably is a moo=
t issue since the Judge determined in the August 13 prehearing conference t=
hat the $150 breakpoint issue is pending before the Commission, probably sh=
ouldn't be dealt with in this proceeding and should be disposed of by stipu=
lation.  The parties are given about a week to agree on a draft stipulation=
 by the 12th on this and other "threshold" issues, failing which the Judge =
will decide the stipulation issue after oral argument on the morning of 9/1=
7.  Bottom line now on when the PX is to submit its data per the amended he=
aring schedule- 10/19.

4.=09Refund implementation procedures have not received much consideration =
as of yet.  Of course, our position is that we net our purchases and sales;=
 not pay in and then expect to be allocated a refund.  Interestingly, the l=
etter at 4b. foretold the finding of the Judge in the August 13 conference =
that refunds and offsets need to be fully a part of this proceeding and the=
 findings that he must certify to the Commission (as opposed to a matter to=

Richard,

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficult=
ies in calculating PX refunds. =20

1.  The PX claims it is a "neutral party in this proceeding" and is only a =
conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  T=
he CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  T=
he PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead a=
nd hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure=
 how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money. =20

2.  Page 3, SC Data.  I was unaware that the CalPX acted as SC until Februa=
ry 28th---one month after it closed the doors on January 31st.  During this=
 time, the CAISO was probably in violation of its Tariff, which requires SC=
s to be creditworthy.

3.  Page 5.  Commandeered contracts.  What is the status of the PX's claim =
against the State of California?  The State owes the PX, as representative =
for its Participants, the mark-to-market value of the contracts on January =
31st, less amounts paid by CDWR to suppliers.  If the PX won't bring this c=
laim, its bankruptcy trustee or the PX Participants should bring this claim=
 against the State of Califonria.

4.  Pages 3 and 4.  $150 Breakpoint.  I asked Kit Blair in Volume Managemen=
t to review this letter and he said that it was his view and the view of tw=
o other folks in VM that the PX is vastly overstating the difficulty in cal=
culating the $150 breakpoint.  His view was that it should take hours or da=
ys, but not weeks.  However, I do not see how we get an advantage from acce=
lerating the calculation of refunds.

Finally, according to reports from Credit and VM, the remaining PX employee=
s are not exactly the "A-team."   I suggest we should ask FERC to require t=
he PX to document its methodology for calculating refunds, so that we can r=
eview for errors.  Spot audits by independent auditors might be a good idea=
, too.

One the chance you are retrieving messages I wanted to update you on my con=
versations with some PX committee members about the arbitration issue.  At =
the moment, in addition to APX and Power Exchange, Avista and perhaps Maran=
t seem to support the idea.  I do not know the positions of Reliant, Sempra=
 and Salton Sea.  Both Avista and Marant feel that something needs to be do=
ne because (1) Edison seems to be blowing us off and (2) the legislature do=
es not seem to be coming up with a solution that helps the power generators=
.  There thought is that it wouldn't really hurt and probably will help to =
put some pressure on.  Avista likes the idea of addressing the issue throug=
h a committee and its counsel.  They think that there is strength in number=
s and like the ability to share the cost of one counsel.  They seem reasona=
bly satisfied with the job Kaye, Scholer is doing.  However, Avista doesn't=
 think that this major a step should be taken on a 5 to 4 vote of the commi=
ttee if that's where things are.  Are you prepared to argue the reasons for=
 deferring action against Edison?

Subject: Re: Important - Letter to Cal PX  

Mary-  I have briefly reviewed your re-write and will take it on the plane to 
Houston.  

The tone of the letter is still to Enron centered instead of Cal PX 
centered.  I think you began the process of softening the tone in your 
rewrite, but I think we should go further.  For example, 

We recognised that that the Market Monitor has a difficult task of better 
understanding the unintended consequences of new rules on the Market, and 
Enron wants to help. When we met recently, we thought we were accomplishing 
this shared goal.  Now, as a consequence, you propose to publish a letter 
that blames us for the problems on the __________ and may cause us to be sued 
based on your findings.  As we prepare to defend ourselves, we find ourselves 
at a disadvantage because the severak conclusions and factual findings are 
not supported and we need a better understanding of how you reached several 
of the conclusions in your letter.  As we discussed, I believe a meeting to 
discuss these matters would be helpful to reaching a mutually acceptable 
resolution.  After this meeting, Enron can promptly provide a response that 
better addresses your concerns, as may be necessary.  We would like to help 
the market monitor in these endeavours, but we cannot continue to be placed 
at a disadvantage through those efforts.  ...

In addition, we need to add Walley as the contact instead of Richard.

I agree with the concept of the short letter.  I have drafted some changes: 
some taking more of a conciliatory tone and others suggesting a potential 
settlement proposal.   Due to all the PRC meetings today, I was unable run 
this by anyone, so this product is simply my suggestions.

Howard--

This is not the tone I expect from a friend and colleague.

On the substance, all the subcommittee reports each week is that it is
having nice meetings, is making some progress and will have more to report
soon.  This has gone on a long time.  As a member of the PC, Reliant would
like to hear a substantive report.  Based on Lisa Mellankamp's email,
subcommittee member Enron seems frustrated.  We think Mirant may be as
well.  I sent an email to you and Marc so that you could make sure BDO
shines on Thursday.  I was being NICE so that everyone could appear
prepared.

     Michael, I assume you are sending these innane emails with rather
     naive questions for the benefit of your client.  Otherwise they really
     are quite insulting to the recipient and amateurish.  The subcommittee
     of Mirant, APX, Enron, LADWP, Powerex, Cohen and BDO are spending time
     on these and other questions.  While it is not complex, to be sure,
     there is more than simple answers to the winddown, budget and other
     questions that we want to resolve in a way that helps us in the short
     and long run.  Just because you are not on the subcommittee, Reliant I
     am sure understands that others owed both more and less are more
     impatient to resolve the process and are working on it even when
     Reliant is not there to root us on.

     Please try to contain this stuff rather than fuel it, please.  Its bad
     enough that I have to deal with Eisenberg.

The California Power Exchange (PX) is likely to issue a letter to its market 
participants indicating that Enron has broken the PX's rules by purposefully 
overscheduling an intertie causing congestion and a market price increase.  
The attached FERC complaint opposing PX action is probably not in final form 
yet, but I wanted to get you in the loop because it may be filed with FERC as 
soon as tomorrow.   The complaint explains that the PX tariff contains no 
prohibition against overscheduling and the California Independent System 
Operator, not the PX, schedules congestion over interties.  Further, under 
FERC precedent, without prior FERC review, the Cal PX should not be issuing 
letters finding violations.  Finally, the PX's analysis is seriously flawed 
because it doesn't consider market rules that actually caused the congestion 
and any potentially related price increase.  

We are very concerned about the PX's actions because we believe California 
utilities may be awaiting this letter to sue EPMI  (estimated claims ranging 
between $6 million and $47 million).  We probably want to aggressively 
publicise the filing so our side of the story comes out instead of the PX's.  
We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the PX where they will likely tell 
us if they will be issuing the letter.  Call me if you have any questions:

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Attached is the August 10, 2001 draft of the proposal to FERC regarding the
allocation methodology based on the latest comments from Lynn Miller.

As we discussed yesterday during the Official Committee conference call,
today I am circulating this draft to the Official Committee, the attorneys
for the Official Committee, the CalPX and the attorneys for the CalPX.  I
would like to receive all comments back from this group by Weds, August 15,
at which point I propose to circulate the draft to the Unofficial Energy
Sellers Group, and the Coral FERC litigation group that initiated the
proceedings that resulted in the April 6 order from FERC rescinding the
chargebacks issued by the CalPX through March 5.  PG&E also asked for an
advance opportunity to comment on the proposal, which we should consider
offering in light of PG&E's more cooperative approach.  I propose to allow
several days for comments from the broader distribution group, and propose
thereafter to file appropriate proceedings concurrently before FERC and the
CalPX bankruptcy court seeking approval of the proposal, as we have
discussed.  Approval from District Judge Moreno should  follow after the
bankruptcy court approval is obtained.

As soon as the Official Committee's attorneys have prepared drafts of the
moving papers that will be submitted to FERC and the bankruptcy court, we
will circulate copies to the members of the Official Committee for comments.

Please let me have your comments as soon as possible.  Thanks.

I agree with the concept of the short letter.  I have drafted some changes: 
some taking more of a conciliatory tone and others suggesting a potential 
settlement proposal.   Due to all the PRC meetings today, I was unable run 
this by anyone, so this product is simply my suggestions.

CONFIDENTIAL
SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Here is a line of argument which we might consider using to muzzle the PX.  


1. Section  19.3.1 of the Tariff  requires the PX to keep  sensitive 
information given to the PX by Participants Confidential.  

2. Section 19.3.3 says no PX Participant has the right to review any  .... 
information... that another PX Participant  has designated as confidential.  

3.  Section 19.3.4 says that if the PX thinks it has to disclose 
information,  it has to let the Participant that will be affected by the 
disclosure have time to challenge the alleged disclosure requirement.

4. PX Tariff Schedule 10  (Dealing with Sanctions)  says that the terms of 
Section 19 apply in Sanction situations.  

 5.  Schedule 10 is silent about whether or not the PX is required or 
permitted to broadcast Sanctions to the market.  

There may be a legal argument based on the Tariff  that the PX has to keep 
quiet about sanctions.  Are they required or permitted to broadcast to the 
whole world their  findings?   

Another line of reasoning based on the Tariff which might be worth exploring  
is as follows:   if this event had occurred now,  with the new sanction part 
of the  tariff in effect, the PX would have had to have conducted an 
investigation in accordance with Section 5.4 which requires the basis of a 
finding to be given and, if after this relatively  fair looking due process 
section was followed, we were found guilty,   we would have received a Level 
1 Sanction,  which is a Formal Warning which "shall take the form of a 
written letter identifying the PX Participant's infraction. "   and nothing 
more.  Therefore,  why is the PX seeking to solve a problem it had before the 
Tariff was brought up to date  on Sanctions with a  Kangaroo Court process  
that is more draconian than its newly approved FERC sanctions?   It is rather 
ironic that we have escaped sanctions because they were't organized to impose 
them when the actions in question occurred, but had the present Tariff been 
in effect then, we probably would not have been treated so shabbily.  Somehow 
this has to be able to be turned into a legal argument in our defence. ---cgy

These are preliminary thoughts which I think merit further pursuit.

Richard,
Attached, please find my analysis of the PX's position as stated in their 
November 11 and December 21 letters.  Based on my discussions with Greg 
Whalley last week, he was of the opinion that we should send a short letter 
with only a few points refuting the PX's position.  The attached letter goes 
into some detail refuting the PX's allegations.  We should talk on Monday or 
Tuesday to discuss the content of the final letter.  Please note, I have not 
included any of the recent FERC-related developments in my analysis.  Based 
on discussions with Ron Carrol last week it appears that we have another 
avenue to pursue.

Tim Belden

The attached PDF file summarizes our view (Mary Hain's and mine) of the 
possible outcomes of taking the PX investigation the FERC route or the PX 
Settlement route.  To make a commercial decision, we need to know what 
jurisdiction we would like this case to be settled in and the rules of 
engagement in each jurisdiction.  For example, if we do a FERC filing we must 
meet a "just and reasonable" standard while if we appeal an ADR decision to 
FERC we have to prove that the ADR finding was "Arbitrary and Capricious."  
Please review the attached file and let me know if any of it is wrong.  
Personally, I need more input from legal and regulatory on what our odds of 
winning our in the different juridictions before I can make an informed 
decision.

See attached.  The information was taken from Cal PX's schedules.

>>> "Mar, Patricia S." <PMar@mofo.com> 5/24/2001 8:03:45 AM >>>
Can you provide me ASAP the contact list you used in sending out the
commandeering letter to PX participants.  Alternatively, please provide me
with information as to who at the following companies the letter was
addressed to and sent (these are the clients that we work with):

Avista Energy
Idaho Power
AES New Energy
El Paso Merchant Energy

I'm assuming you used a CalPX list which has contact persons who are not the
same as the people I've been dealing with, and I need to know whose getting
the letter.  Especially since the claim form is apparently pre-filled in
with the names of these people.

Thanks.

Mary-  I have briefly reviewed your re-write and will take it on the plane to 
Houston.  

The tone of the letter is still to Enron centered instead of Cal PX 
centered.  I think you began the process of softening the tone in your 
rewrite, but I think we should go further.  For example, 

We recognised that that the Market Monitor has a difficult task of better 
understanding the unintended consequences of new rules on the Market, and 
Enron wants to help. When we met recently, we thought we were accomplishing 
this shared goal.  Now, as a consequence, you propose to publish a letter 
that blames us for the problems on the __________ and may cause us to be sued 
based on your findings.  As we prepare to defend ourselves, we find ourselves 
at a disadvantage because the severak conclusions and factual findings are 
not supported and we need a better understanding of how you reached several 
of the conclusions in your letter.  As we discussed, I believe a meeting to 
discuss these matters would be helpful to reaching a mutually acceptable 
resolution.  After this meeting, Enron can promptly provide a response that 
better addresses your concerns, as may be necessary.  We would like to help 
the market monitor in these endeavours, but we cannot continue to be placed 
at a disadvantage through those efforts.  ...

In addition, we need to add Walley as the contact instead of Richard.

Subject: Important - Letter to Cal PX

I agree with the concept of the short letter.  I have drafted some changes: 
some taking more of a conciliatory tone and others suggesting a potential 
settlement proposal.   Due to all the PRC meetings today, I was unable run 
this by anyone, so this product is simply my suggestions.

Richard, I hope you are checking your emails.  Here is Howard's thinking.  Is your opposition based on the view that, at this time, no action should be taken against SCE or on the view that maybe action is ok, but it should be handled other than by Kaye, Scholer?

Bob, there is so much happening in Sacramento and Wash DC that impacts the
decision about Edison that I really need an opportunity to bring you and
Richard up to speed.  That cannot happen during a full Committee call.

There have been several separate conference calls organized by Reliant to
advocate the involuntary petition, which is, I think, fraught with legal,
economic and political peril (especially sanctions, damages, etc. because
the claims are subject to bona fide dispute by and large, as you know).
Most others (Dynergy, Duke etc) seem to agree with me on the involuntary.
The Cal legislature is pushing hard on a bill, now supported by Gov Davis
and Edison, that specifically refuses to fund repayment of the energy
seller's claims while paying the banks and QFs.  We need a measured and
prompt message to deliver to the Gov, Edison and Legisl before they pass a
bill that calls for financing other claims that may not happen (even at the
lower number without sellers' claims) if the consequences are that the cloud
of an involuntary or litigation or arbitration will scare the underwriters
of the bonds away in any event.

Of course, some could argue that the Gov, Legisl and Edison are doing this
on purpose to provoke the involuntary or litigation so that when Edison goes
into chapter 11 they can say the blood is on the gouging sellers' hands not
on theirs.  Or, that may be giving all those "D" students more credit than
they deserve.  I don't know.

Please forward this email on to Richard and others at Enron as appropriate.
Please also let me know when Richard is available for a separate discussion
on this and related matters.  I know he is busy on many other things.

I'm around but Richard is in South America.  He's going to try and hook into
the conference call on Thursday, however.  Richard seemed to have several
problems with the idea of making a demand at this time.  Like Reliant, he
wanted to be sure that he had carefully thought through all the possible
implications of making a demand as it would bear on the FERC proceedings,
actions by individual participants and possible bankruptcy.  He also wasn't
sure whether he supported current committee counsel leading the charge but
no firm thoughts on that point.  He also was not inclined to draw the line
in the sand until he saw what comes out of the legislature.  Richard seems
to have some overarching concerns about overlawyering which I suppose are
understandable given the number of counsel that just Enron is supporting.
We obviously need to consider how the committee discharges its fiduciary
duties in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  I Richard's point
is that there are a bunch of other lawyers who already are actively involved
in things, I guess we need to consider whether the committee can use them to
represent the collective interests of all participants.  Bob

Subject:=09RE: Current Fate of SB 78xx


Based on numerous discussions with members and  staff in Sacramento, the be=
st speculation on the status of the SCE bailout  legislation is as follows.=
  The Senate is reviewing the amended SB 78xx  approved by the Assembly las=
t Thursday.  They will not approve it as  is.  Instead, they will "hijack" =
one of a number of Assembly bills on  energy currently before the Senate fo=
r concurrence.  "Hijacking" means  gutting a bill and substituting in langu=
age on related but different  matters.  Hence, they would in this instance =
keep the energy theme but  change the bill in question to an SCE bailout bi=
ll, one that  largely resembles the Polanco-Sher bill approved by the Senat=
e in July.   The hijacked bill will deal with the bailout itself (DCR for n=
on-generator  creditors, etc.) and the conservation easements, but will str=
ip out other  elements that differ from the Polanco-Sher bill like direct a=
ccess,  renewables, lowering the rate payer base to 20 kwh, etc.  The direc=
t access  and renewables elements might or might not be added on to some ot=
her energy  bills currently before the Senate.  The rate payer threshold wi=
ll be  included in the hijacked bill and will likely be increased from 20 k=
wh to 125  kwh (note that the latter would be a reduction from the original=
 500 kwh level  in the Polanco-Sher bill).
=20
The Senate will send the hijacked bill back to  the Assembly, probably on W=
ednesday.  The Assembly will have the choice of  taking it or leaving it OR=
 calling for a conference committee to work it out  before session ends mid=
night on Friday.  The latter is the likely  alternative, setting up round t=
he clock all nighters for the conferees through  Friday.  If the conference=
 committee reaches consensus, the resulting bill  will have to be approved =
by both houses before sending it to the Governor.   If the conferees think =
there's a deal  there but they need more time, they can ask the Governor to=
 extend the session  into next week.  That scenario seems unlikely.  The me=
mbers  want to  either pass or reject the bill this week and get out of  Do=
dge.
=20
If there is no hope of consensus this week, the  bill will likely die at th=
at point and the bailout will be history.  The  Governor can try to prolong=
 things to give him more time to persuade  members to pass the bill by eith=
er extending the session into next week or by  adjourning the session and c=
alling for a Third Extraordinary Session next week  or at some later date. =
 The Senate and Assembly would be compelled to go  into session, but just a=
s with a normal session, individual members would not be  compelled to atte=
nd.  If there were either (1) not enough members  present for a quorum or (=
2) not enough "yes" votes present even if there is a  quorum, the bill dies=
.
=20
I emphasize again that this is all conjecture  at this point (albeit reason=
ably informed) and that things could change  dramatically at any time.  I'l=
l keep you posted as things play out day to  day this week.  Please feel fr=
ee to give me a call with any  questions.

Subject: Important FERC order re CalPX investigation

On November 23rd, the FERC issued an order that I believe is crucial in our 
case with the California PX.  In a case involving the New York ISO (New York 
Independent System Operator, Docket ER97-1523-010) FERC put the PX on notice 
that it will be revisiting the authorities and discretion it gave the PX to 
address exercises of market power.  

In the case, FERC only allowed the ISO to engage in voluntary actions on the 
part of ISO participants (such as negotiations).  However, in response to 
Enron (& ironically PG&E's) protests it found that the mitigation plan 
proposed by the ISO gave the ISO too much discretion and lacked specificity.  
FERC suggested that in filing a revised mitigation plan, the ISO propose to 
file on a case-by-case basis under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, to 
impose specific mitigation measures when the ISO concludes that they are 
warranted.  The filing would identify the particular conduct and justify the 
specific mitigation measures as a remedy.  Also, for recurring types of 
conduct it could propose mitigation and propose that it be authorized to 
impose the same mitigation measures on a prospective basis without making a 
subsequent filing in response to future conduct. 

In addition, the FERC specifically names California (although it doesn't 
mention the PX) and states that "In rejecting the measures proposed here, we 
are aware that we have previously approved similar measures for other ISOs, 
such as those in New England and California.  We approved these earlier 
proposals in order to give these ISOs discretion to respond quickly to 
unforeseen market power and market design flaws, given the lack of prior 
experience with ISO operations.  This initial period is now passed and the 
authorities and discretion we previously accorded ISOs are, we believe, no 
longer appropriate.  We intend to revisit the authorities and discretion of 
these other ISOs."

Not only is this a major victory for Enron, I believe this is our strongest 
argument for why the PX is now on notice that its proposed letter is beyond 
its authority.  Essentially, this case notifies the PX that the tariff the PX 
used as the basis for its proposed letter is at best of suspect effectiveness 
and at worst unlawful.  Further, it suggests that the PX cannot act against 
EPMI without making a Section 205 filing with FERC under which the PX bears 
the burden of proof.  

I think if Greg Whalley is going to call the PX, he should bring up this FERC 
order.

Attached is the memo on the potential SCE arbitration that the committee
requested.  Because the memo analyzes potential claims and defenses, it is
extremely important that the memo NOT become discoverable.  Please do not
distribute it beyond those that you need to assist you in directing the
actions of the Committee.

For the most part, the committee call was uneventful.  The commandeering ac=
tion is proceeding.  The State has asked us to stipulate to lift the stay o=
n the chance that it will want to assert counterclaims.  We aren't sure wha=
t counterclaims it would have against the PX, so we are asking for details =
to evaluate the State's request.  The arbitration demand will be discussed =
in a special call next Wednesday at 3 pacific.  Weg acknowledged that peopl=
e are still thinking through the implications of the arbitration.  His conc=
ern is applying some pressure while the legislature is in session and consi=
dering the Edison bailout issue.  Some committee members evidently are conc=
erned about the bearing of an arbitration on a possible involuntary petitio=
n.  I suppose we can take this up in our call next Tuesday.  On Sept. 5 the=
 court will consider Edison's objection to employment of Kaye, Scholer and =
BDO Seidman.  A response will be filed today.  PGE evidently is filing a de=
claration in support of our committee.  Interesting.  A 2004 exam of Edison=
 is now scheduled on Sept. 25.  We expect that Edison will be moving for so=
me kind of protective order.  Weg wants to form an Edison subcommittee and =
would like Enron to be on it.  Your thoughts?  The biggest issue of the day=
 related to structuring a plan.  With the prospect that the PX will run out=
 of money soon, we need to define responsibilies, create a budget and find =
a funding source ASAP.  Weg suggests the earnings on the $400 million (abou=
t $6 million to date) to get us through the chapter 11 case.  Then we'll ha=
ve to find a source for post-confirmation activities like pursuing commande=
ering litigation, maintaining records, running numbers and making distribtu=
ions.  Cohen made a speech about the need to nail this down soon because hi=
s firm is actively involved in litigation matters that cost a lot to mainta=
in.  Let's talk about this issue next week.  We obviously need work to cont=
inue and that costs money.  Finally, the Weg settlement is being reviewed, =
among others, by PGE.  Their initial reaction was quite positive.  Howard h=
opes to have comments so he can present it to FERC by Sept. 15 as what he s=
tyles an "offer of settlement".  Bob

Two days ago the PX posted a notice of a sanctions committee meeting on 
December 14th.  The agenda for that meeting is to:
 
1. Describe the Administrative Sanctions Procedures as set forth in Schedule 
10 of the CalPX Tariff. 

2. Describe the operation of the Sanctions Committee.

3. Take comments from CalPX Participants.

I'd like to recommend that Sue attend this meeting and recommend that the 
CalPX needs to refile its sanctions procedures in light of the FERCs dicta in 
the New York ISO case.  What do others think?

Richard, Howard seems to acknowledge that the FERC proceedings could themse=
lves, within several months, could bring us to the point of knowing the amo=
unt of our claim against PGE even without the benefit of the formula sugges=
ted by Weg's proposal.  That raises the question of what we get from the We=
g settlement.  Although he has not specifically articulated the benefits, H=
oward would tell you that his settlement would avoid the cost of litigating=
 the splits, would avoid the delay attendant to inevitable challenges of a =
contested FERC order and would get our collateral back sooner rather than l=
ater.  I'm still not entirely clear about the procedure he intends to adopt=
 to get his deal done and whether there are potential impediments.  He has =
characterized the deal as a bankruptcy compromise between PX, the debtor, a=
nd the participants.  If all the participants go along, that characterizati=
on is ok.  If some participants (Mirant/SCE) oppose, the only way you can b=
ind them to the deal in the PX bankruptcy is through a reorganization plan,=
 and that itself will take time.  Weg seems to think that most participants=
 will go along.  I'm sure Edison would oppose.  Although they aren't a favo=
red party in the PX case, they could have the ability to stymie a settlemen=
t.  Next, the settlement also impacts PGE and its bankruptcy.  If PGE doesn=
't go along, it can argue that its bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to fix=
 the claims against PGE, not the PX bankruptcy court.  Then the settlement =
needs to be presented to and adopted by FERC---again an opportunity for par=
ties to object.  These procedural hurdles may not have to be dealt with, bu=
t I've received no good exposition of how they would be if they in fact mat=
erialize.  Are you comfortable proceeding on the assumption that everyone w=
ill go along?  Bob Nelson

It seems to me that FERC's July 25 Order required Judge Birchman to make
findings about the exact amounts owed by each buyer to each seller.  The
proposal to establish methodologies does exactly that, among other things.
Therefore, it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending
California proceedings.

That is not to say, however, that it should not also be part of the
Chargeback proceedings under the April 6 FERC order.  It should also be
applicable to those proceedings.

Therefore, we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both
proceedings.  Timing is obviously critical, and I am soliciting the
Chargeback movants' views on that subject along with the substance of the
proposal.  I would like to point out that I have learned from the settlemen=
t
proceedings before Judge Wagner that we must submit the proposal early in
the proceedings to ensure that they are considered and can have an impact.

I sent an email to Ron Carroll letting him know that I am available for a
conference call at the following times:

Weds Aug 22 after 11 am Pacific time,
Thurs Aug 23 prior to 1 pm Pacific time,
Fri Aug 24 anytime except 1130 am to 2 pm Pacific time

Please let me know when we can discuss this further.  Thanks for your help.

Thanks for the analysis, Mary.  It does a lot to clarify the context within 
which the PX is conducting their investigation.  If your analysis is right, 
it seems like the PX has virtually nothing to stand on.  But why do they 
continue to pursue a course of action that seems inconsistent with their 
tariff and FERC's recent rulings?  Why do you think the PX believes that they 
have a case (or the right to publish a letter about us) against us??  Before 
we meet with Sladoje, I'd like to get a better understanding of their 
legal/regulatory side of the argument.

Tim and I went over your piece.  We like the airline analogy and worked with 
it in the "not a big deal" section and corrected the facts.  We also added a 
third bullet under the tariff discussion.

I've attached our comments on Mary's analysis of the PX's authority re: the 
Silver Peak Line investigation.  As you will see, we agree with Mary's 
analysis, subject to minor quibbles that do not affect the conclusion, that 
EPMI should not be found to have violated the literal terms of the PX's 
tariff, that the PX has no sanction authority over this matter, and that 
publication of the Compliance Unit's findings would be inappropriate.

We would, however, take a harder line on the proposed compromise.  In our 
view, we should insist that the PX never publicly link EPMI to the events of 
Mary 24-25.  Thus, we should agree to support a tariff filing by the PX to 
clean-up the loophole in its tariff revealed by these events, as long as the 
tariff filing does not mention either EPMI or these events as the basis for 
the filing.

We had the shortest call in history today.  We discussed Edison.  Edison
withdrew its opposition to our employment of professionals and will be
producing documents in response to our 2004 notice.  There's been some
speculation about whether parties will be filing an involuntary petition
against SCE.  Reliant wasn't on our call today and I couldn't help but
wonder whether they were busy with other things.  In that regard, Howard
Weg is establishing an SCE subcommittee and wants us to participate.
What's your position.  As to Edison, there's a reasonable likelihood now
that the legislature will approve a package that (1) has no funding to pay
us, (2) permits Edison to use funds to pay dividends on preferred stock and
(3) waives Edison's commandeering claims.  As to the last issue, Kaye
Scholer opines that Edison's waiver will have no impact on the PX's right
to pursue the commandeering suit.  This week there will be several meetings
aimed at finalizing a reorganization plan.  We'll have a report during our
next call which is scheduled Sept,. 17 at 1 LA time.  Weg is consulting
with FERC lawyers about presentation of his proposed settlement.  He plans
to proceed fairly soon both before FERC and in the bankruptcy court.  Bob

Richard,

As requested, below please find language that I recommend be included in the 
Settlement.  The first sentence preserves Enron's right to appeal the 
findings of an ADR proceeding that may emanate out of this matter to FERC or 
any competent court; as it turns out, this right is provided under Section 
4.1 of the PX's Dispute Resolution Procedures.  The second sentence is 
intended to preserve Enron's right in other proceedings (as we have done 
already) to challenge the legality of ISOs and PXs to conduct investigations 
such as the one that they have in this instance:

"Nothing in this Settlement prejudices or limits Enron's rights under Section 
4.1 of PX Tariff Schedule 9, Dispute Resolution Procedures, related to any 
ADR proceeding that may address the same subjects that are addressed in this 
Settlement.  Moreover, although Enron has agreed not to seek review of the 
decision and order issued by the Chief Executive Officer in this proceeding 
based upon this Offer of Settlement, nothing in this Settlement prejudices 
Enron's right in other proceedings to challenge the CalPX's right, under 
United States federal law, the Federal Power Act, the Administrative 
Procedures Act, and applicable FERC regulations and decisions, to investigate 
allegations of improper market behavior and to issue findings and impose 
sanctions related to such investigations."

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Ron

Lisa,

Here is the information you requested on our claim against PG&E for the California ISO underscheduling penalty.

Overview of the penalty:  The ISO assesses a penalty---known as Charge Type 480---against Scheduling Coordinators whose actual demand exceeds scheduled demand by more than 5%.  You can find this in the ISO Tariff at Section 2.2.13.2.3.  The Tariff also provides that the Underscheduling Penalty will be distributed to SCs whose actual demand exceeds scheduled demand by less than a 5%.  ISO Tariff Section 2.2.13.2.3.3.  Underscheduling Penalty Revenues are distributed as Charge Type 1480.  Here is a handout from the ISO explaining the charge.  

 

Procedural background:  On December 8, 2000, the ISO filed a Tariff change with FERC in which the ISO proposed a penalty that would be assessed against Scheduling Coordinators that underscheduled load, i.e., actual demand exceeded scheduled demand.  This Amendment 33 was adopted by FERC in its December 15, 2000. Order.  In March, the ISO filed Tariff Amendment 38, asking that the Underscheduling Penalty be suspended.  The ISO noted that in its transmittal letter accompanying its filing that "Most of the shortfall in the amount of forward scheduled Load is attributable to PG&E and SCE. . . .From January 1, 2001 to March 14, 2001, the ISO estimates that the penalties will exceed $400 million."  Page 4, Transmittal Letter for Amendment 38 to the ISO Tariff, submitted to FERC on March 20, 2001.

FERC rejected the ISO's request to suspend the penalty, and so the ISO reluctantly calculated the amounts that would be due to each SC.

The ISO has informed us that we are due $33.8 million.  Here is the spreadsheet the ISO sent us.   And this is the letter regarding PG&E claims that accompanied this spreadsheet.   

Unfortunately, the CAISO's information does not show us how much of the amount is attributable to PG&E.  I called the CAISO this morning, and was told that others have been requesting this breakout of information.  The ISO's response was that it would be impossible for it to determine how much of the PX's penalty was attributable to PG&E---and therefore it was not going to rerun the settlements.  I told them that the PX only scheduled power for 17 days while the penalty was in effect and that we would still be interested in seeing what PG&E owed for the period of January 18 to present.  They are taking this under consideration and promised to get back to me, but I am not holding my breath.

I would phrase the claim in this manner:

1.  The ISO is obligated under its Tariff to assess Underscheduling Penalties to SCs underscheduling load by more than 5%.
2.  The ISO filed papers with FERC in March stating that Underscheduling Penalties had already reached approximately $400 million, and most of that amount was due from PG&E and SCE.
3.  To assist SCs in preparing claims against PG&E, the CAISO provided EPMI with a statement showing that we are due $33.8 million in Underscheduling Penalty Revenues.
4.  While PG&E may not owe EPMI the full $33.8 million, based on the ISO's assertions to FERC on March 20, 2001 that PG&E and SCE were responsible for most of the penalties, it is almost certain that PG&E's obligations constitute a large proportion of the amount.
5.  EPMI does not have enough information regarding PG&E's meter data to calculate with precision the amount of Underscheduling Penalty Revenues owing from PG&E.
6.  As of today, the ISO has not released information regarding PG&E's liability on this matter to EPMI.
7.  Because PG&E does have this information, it is appropriate for EPMI to submit a claim for $33.8 million and let PG&E---which has the necessary information---provide any evidence it has to show that it owes less than $33.8 millon.

(Richard may have a better suggestion about how to frame No. 7 above.)

I hope this helps.  I'll be back in the office Monday.  If you have any questions, I'm at (503) 464-7795.

Steve
