Gayla,
While I was getting ready to prepare execution copies I was notified of some additional language that is being added to our template that helps clarify a few issues.  I was asked to send you a blacklined draft for review.  Please also forward a copy of the blacklined draft to Tracy and if either of you have any questions regarding the changes please let me know.  The last change in the Annex is still being finalized but I included it so you could review the language/concept.

Regards,
Brent

Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Attached are the draft ConfirmLogic documents for Entergy Koch for your review.  Prior to this going to a wider circulation within Enron for comment I would appreciate any comments or suggestions on the structure and format.  There are many definitions in these documents that will need careful review to ensure that the end result is consistent with our practice.  Exhibit A needs to be modified so that the Index name is consistent with what will be input into ConfirmLogic.  There are also some missing variables in certain of the indexes that will need clarification.     

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
Brent

Attached, please find the 2001 ISDA Cross-Agreement Bridge, blacklined
against the last version you received, dated July 26, 2001.  In addition,
please find a copy of the Commentary on the Bridge.

As many of you know, various working groups prepared amendments to the ISDA
Master Agreements to be effected through the use of a 2001 ISDA Master
Agreement Protocol.  In connection with this effort, the Structural Issues
Working Group prepared the Cross-Agreement Bridge.  Following meetings of
the Strategic Documentation Review Task Force in late July and discussions
in August and September, it was felt that the Protocol approach was too
complicated, from an operational and logistical perspective, given the
nature and the number of the proposed amendments.  Accordingly, it was
decided that the four euro annexes would be separated from the Protocol and
compiled in their own 2001 Euro Protocol.  The 2001 Euro Protocol is now
available on our website and the adherence period ends on November 30, 2001.
Annexes 1 to 9 of the Protocol have been prepared as a Form of Amendment to
the ISDA Master Agreements.  The Form of Amendment, and the Commentary, will
be published on ISDA's website late this week or early next week.  Work is
scheduled to begin on a new Master Agreement and kick-off meetings to
discuss the new draft Master Agreement will be held in London later this
year.  Details will be announced to the Documentation Committee soon.

As for the Bridge, it was felt that we should publish this on our website as
well.  Accordingly, I have attached the drafts for your review.  Please note
that the "option to disapply" was deleted in this draft, primarily because
the version of the Bridge considered by ISDA's netting counsel in late 2000
did not include such an option.

I would be grateful if you could review the attached documents by Friday,
November 2.  I would like to publish these on our website on Monday,
November 5.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at 212-332-1203 if you have any
questions. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Kimberly Summe

Please be advised that the Skadden supplier code previously provided to
us (SADMF) was incorrect.

The correct code is SASMF.  We have been told by Ford that the code now
works.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"

MUCH THANKS!!!

Kim and Mark,

The attached is a list that Janna Blanter at Duke sent which details the transactions that they believe are between Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership and ENA which need to be moved to the ECC ISDA. From our records, I do not think this matches, but we need to reconcile.  Kim, if you could try to match these up and pull the confirms to determine which legal entity we used. Anything that is ENA we will need to assign to ECC. Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya

This is a follow up to my conversation with Tanya in reference to
transactions between DEM LP and Enron North America to be assigned to Enron
Canada Corp.  I failed to get Tanya's e-mail address (or correct spelling
of her name so if it is misspelled please forgive me) and I ask you to
forward this to her.  Attached is the spreadsheet list of the transactions
to be assigned.  Furthermore, she asked for our legal counsel's name to
discuss the collateral agreement issues and that would be Joe Forbes at
(713) 627-6124.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

I hope you are well.  Nobel started this week -- a great excuse to go out

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.
Bradford has agreed to these terms.   Our Credit Department is expecting
that we bring this document to a closure quickly.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Mark, oh master of EOL - Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from London.  My assumption is that the trades by the hedge funds on EOL will have to be with ECTRIC because of the way EOL is set up.  Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?  Thanks, as always, for your input.  Frank

FYI, I just received this e-mail from Janine.  Have you already sorted out the structure with Robyn?  I would like to send an e-mail to Robyn, copying you and Janine with the summary of our discussions from yesterday.

What do you think about the proposed EnronOnline arrangement?

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

>From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

>From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Subject:	RE: Material Contract Review -- ASAP

I reviewed the following deals:

Duferco (closed September, 2001)

A Merger Event would constitute an Event of Default on the part of ENA, if the surviving entity did not assume ENA's obligations, or the creditworthiness of the surviving entity or transferee is materially weaker than its predecessor immediately prior to the merger.....But there are the basic exceptions for an affilitate transaction.

Huntco (closed June, 2001):

Under the Inventory Management  structure, ENA's rights under all Transactions (inventory purchases and sales) may be assigned under a sale to an affiliate, an spv we manage, a successor to all or substantially all our assets, or an assignment in connection with  a financing or other financial arrangement without Huntco's consent.

Under the Loan (we made to Huntco), we may assign the Loan to anyone after notice to Huntco, or to an affilitate without notice to Huntco.  There are no change of control provisions which impact ENA's position.

Under the LLC which owns the cold mill (a steel processing plant), ENA owns the Class B Interest, and a disposition of that interest (which requires the initial Class A Member's consent) includes a merger or consolidation other than where ENA is the surviving entity.  To my knowledge, the Class A Member is still the initial Class A Member (Long Lane Master Trust IV-a Fleet National Bank entity--the ENA contact is Don Herrick).


EEX/Swiss Re (closed May 2000)

Enron Re is a subsidiary of ENA, and a counterparty to a Master ISDA and Swap Confirm with Swiss Re.  Andrews & Kurth will be forwarding the final paperwork to me shortly and I will review. [Stoler, Lou]    I reviewed and spoke with Mark Taylor, and this transaction provideds for a standard Credit Event Upon Merger provision...ie if the creditworthiness of the successor is materially worse than ours at the time of the event, our counterparty may ask for Eligible Credit Support. 


Peoples Energy (Chicago Hub Transaction) (closed 1999)

ENA owns 100% of Enron Midwest LLC, which 50% of the Enron-Peoples LLC based out of Chicago.  I spoke with Jeff Hodge who indicated that he would review and advise on any change in control provisions.

We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.

Thanks again, NJD

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

Fred, sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I understand you were in communication with Mark Taylor.  Thanks for the quick turn around and excellent and thorough analysis.  I have both read and understand the analysis.  I am somewhat concerned regarding the final comment regarding ASC's scrutiny of EOL, but other than being careful, I am not sure what we can do.

With respect to transactions with counterparties who are not "Qualified Parties", it is almost inconceivable given the breadth of the "commercial user" exemption and the representations obtained in our contract that we would ever transact with a counterparty which is not a Qualified Party.

Regards, Peter

Kathryn:

The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara

Subject:	RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help
Kathryn

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Please see the attached list which details items pending for legal review and comments. The list details the issue by counterparty and the number of unsigned transactions as a result of the issue.  Can you provide me with an update as to where we stand on each item or if there is additional information needed from the confirmation team?  I would like to know which attorney has each particular Counterparty issue.  Thanks for your assistance.

The recent revisions to the UCC Article 9 relate to the ability of counterp=
arties to engage in receivable financings which could have the effect of de=
feating the master netting concepts because it makes the restrictions on su=
ch actions included in the master netting agreement ineffective.  Prior law=
 made prohibitions, but not restrictions, ineffective. I am in the process =
of adding some language to the form on which we are working to manage this =
issue (however, we will leave the restrictions in place as well for possibl=
e waiver arguments or further changes in future law).  In essence each of t=
he parties will take and perfect a security interest in its own potential o=
bligations to each of the other parties.  This will require UCC searches of=
 our counterparties at the outset of negotiations to be sure we will hold a=
 first lien.  It will require a downdate and filing as we consummate the ne=
tting agreement.  To the extent you are in current negotiations, you may wi=
sh to conduct the appropriate lien searches.  Rick Antonoff should coordina=
te the searches and filings for us.  If you have any questions, please advi=
se.


Rick Antonoff, by copy of this memo, please prepare filings for the PGE mas=
ter netting and the NewPower master netting to support the grants of securi=
ty interests to us in the amounts we owe them.  Each of these agreements in=
cludes this language in the security interest grants (6(b)). =20
1.  The New Power Company is incorporated in Delaware.  Provide me the form=
 of proposed statement for review prior to filing.  We should make this fil=
ing as soon as possible.  A copy of the final version is attached.
2.  As to PGE, I will verify with Lisa Mellencamp that it is ok to file on =
the master netting agreement and the entities involved since they were not =
in the bankruptcy (to my knowledge).  Once verified, I will let you know.  =
The PGE parties are:  PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation, PG&E Energy Trad=
ing, Canada Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P., and CEG Energy, O=
ptions Inc.  I do not have these entities states of incorporation.  Lisa at=
 853-7986 can get that information for you.  I do not have the final versio=
n of this netting on line; if you need it, let me know.
