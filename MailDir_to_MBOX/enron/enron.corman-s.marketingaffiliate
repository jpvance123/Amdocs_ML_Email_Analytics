CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEDGED 
ATTORNEY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT 

Yesterday, we had a conference call with the pipeline transportation analysts 
to determine whether John Morris, the economist who will conduct a market 
power study for INGAA, had crafted a data request that would gather the right 
sort of information nececessary.? Columbia, Enron, and Koch did not have 
representatives on the call.? I'm available this afternoon to give you all an 
update on what was discussed?? We decided to take a snap shot in time on firm 
pipeline transactions that occurred during the month of November 2000.? John 
Morris will be sending out a revised data request (through me) that reflects 
some of the suggestions proposed by the group.? He is very open to tallking 
to your transportation folks directly to answer any questions you may have.? 
You have his telephone number from an earlier email.???

Subject: Template for pipeline data 

Privileged & Confidential 
Prepared for Counsel 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing a template of the data 
for the INGAA study of affiliate prevelance on pipelines. 
The spreadsheet is in Excel 95 format.? Please get back to 
me if you need another format. 

The spreadsheet has three tabs.? The first is for the 
pipeline capacity data an a conversion factor between Dth/d 
and Mcf/d.? The second is for data on the primary holders of 
capacity.? I have added a field for the DUNS number of the 
shipper and agent to assist in matching shippers across 
pipeline companies. The third sheet contains the capacity 
release data.? I decided to separate out the capacity 
release data from the primary shipper data so that we can 
examine whether results are sensitive to different 
assumptions about capacity release. 

If you have any questions or comments, please give me a call 
at 202-833-5208.? --jrm

Re:?????? Docket No. PL00-1, Marketing Affiliate Rules 

???? Attached is Duke Energy Gas Transmission's draft of the sections which 
Duke? agreed? to? prepare.? We look forward to discussing these with you in 
more? detail.?? Duke? believes? that? it? is? critically important that the 
distinction be made between gas and electric industries since that seems to 
be? a? topic? that? is? high on the FERC Staff's mind and you will see this 
reflected? in our draft.? In addition, we would echo the thoughts forwarded 
to? you? by? Janice Alperin about the need to employ an expert.? As you can 
see,? many? of? the? arguments? in this draft need support from an economic 
expert. 

???? Duke? believes that INGAA should view of the utilization of experts on 
a long-term basis, not just for comments to be filed on January 5, 2001, or 
the? presentation? on? January? 31,? 2001.? This is likely to be an ongoing 
dialogue and that there well may be opportunities for further presentations 
and? for reply to anecdotal evidence presented by others.? Also, we believe 
that? the? use? of? more? than? one policy expert would be appropriate.? In 
particular,? we? feel it would be helpful to have an expert with a national 
reputation? that? could address the issues from a broad policy and economic 
prospective? and? we? would like to discuss specific recommendations at our 
next meeting. 

???? Duke? will? make? available? whatever internal resources are needed to 
help in developing the INGAA comments for filing on January 5, 2001, and in 
the? preparation? of? the? presentation? to? be? made? on January 31, 2001. 
However, Duke believes that this is a long-term effort that ought not to be 
limited? by? the? short-term? time? deadline? we? currently? face.? In some 
respects,? it? may be preferable to "wait and see" what the allegations are 
from the other side and weigh in at that time. 

???? We? look? forward? to? further? discussions? with you at your earliest 
convenience.
