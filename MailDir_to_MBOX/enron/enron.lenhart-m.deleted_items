Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

A rich white lawyer in Georgia decided that he wanted to throw a

>  LeRoy, the token black guy in the neighborhood. The party was 
>  held around the pool in the backyard of the lawyers mansion. 
>  Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating shrimp, 
>  oysters, and BBQ, and flirting with the women. 
> 
>  At the height of the party the rich white lawyer dude said, "I have a 10ft 
>  man-eating gator in my pool and I'll give a million dollars to anyone who 
>  has the guts to jump in." The words were barely out of the rich white 
>  lawyer's mouth when there was a loud splash and everyone turned 
>  around and saw  Leroy in the pool!  Leroy was fighting the gator and 
>  kicking it's ass!  Leroy was jabbing the gator in the eyes with his 
>  thumbs, throwing punches, doing all kinds of stuff like head butts and 
>  choke holds, biting the gator on the tail and flipping the gator through 
>  the air like some kind of Japanese Judo Instructor. The water was 
>  churning and splashing everywhere. Both Leroy and the gator were 
>  screaming and raising hell. Finally Leroy strangled the 
>  gator and let it sink to the bottom like a K-mart goldfish. Leroy then 
>  slowly climbed out of the pool.  Everyone was just staring at him 
>  in disbelief. Finally, the rich white lawyer says, 
> 
>  "Well, Leroy, I reckon I owe you a million dollars." 
>  "No, that's okay. I don't want it," said Leroy. 
> 
>  The rich white lawyer insisted. "Man, 
>  I have to give you something. You won the bet. 
> 
>  How about half a million bucks then?" "No thanks.  I don't want it," 
>  answered Leroy. The white lawyer said, "Come on, I insist on giving 
>  you something. That was amazing.  How about a new Porsche and a 
>  Rolex and some stock options?"  Still, the brother said no.  So, the 
>  confused rich white lawyer said, "Well, Leroy, then what do you want?" 
> 
>  Leroy said, "I want the name of the son of a bitch who pushed 
>  me into the pool..."

Hi All,

Just wanted to take a minute to thank each of you for celebrating my birthday with me. I was in a bit of a mood yesterday, but dinner with all of you last night really helped me to enjoy the day. 

Thanks so much,
Lisa

i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he
called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all
welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you
guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat,
and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as
for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side
cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip?

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
"Overrated, Overrated".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called "Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al"
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   "Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   "The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   "LSU would whip UT"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   "UT is the most overrated team in college football" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   "Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was "tiger bait, tiger bait" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

r you on both:      [IMAGE] XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Featured=
 in Investor's Business Daily   Thusday, May 12th's edition of the venerabl=
e Investor's Business Daily carried an article in the Internet & Technology=
 Section, authored by Sarah Z. Sleeper entitled "U.N Group OKs 'Language' T=
hat Could Spur E-Business".   The article mentions that the U.N.'s group OA=
SIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) =
has announced the specific International standards for programming with ebX=
ML.   Long term readers know one of our featured companies, XML Global Tech=
nologies has been developing programming tools for this new and revolutiona=
ry programming language which is expected to become the new International S=
tandard by which all computer systems communicate with each other.   XML Gl=
obal is mentioned in the article along with Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Orac=
le. Here are several excerpts:   "With little fanfare, the e-conomy receive=
d what might prove to have been a pretty good jolt."  (first paragraph) "It=
's backed (ebXML) by a bevy of tech heavy-hitters. They include Sun Microsy=
stems, Inc., IBM Corp. and Oracle Corp." (5th paragraph) "The biggest win i=
s going to be for the average consumer, said David Weber, as vice president=
 at Vancouver B.C.- based software firm XML Global Technologies, Inc. EbXML=
 will reduce costs for companies." (11th paragraph)  The article goes on to=
 describe recent international demonstrations of the product where XML Glob=
al participated along with Bea Systems, Commerce One, and Sun Microsystems.=
   Clearly XML Global Technologies has placed itself directly in the path o=
n an oncoming tidal wave of new programming opportunities, and is the David=
 in a team of Goliaths headed towards the adoption of ebXML.    Rarely are =
microcap stocks prominently mentioned in the company of such huge success s=
tories. XML Global has a tiger by the tail.   The stock has drifted back on=

Funny Ross,

Hey I saw that Lenhart has made his way to our email bullshit, thanks for
giving us a call this weekend when you were in town. By the way can we all
stay at your house when we are in Denver!
I promise to have Robicheaux tested before your Maw gets hit by the banjo!

Hi All:

Thought you might enjoy reading this description of the outdoor barbecuing
process.

Morey

 Definition of Outdoor Barbecuing
  It's the only type of cooking a "real" man will do.  When a man volunteers
to do such cooking, the following chain of events is put into motion.
  (1)     The woman goes to the store.
  (2)     The woman fixes the salad, vegetables, and dessert.
  (3)     The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray along
with the necessary        cooking utensils, and takes it to the man, who is
lounging beside the grill, drinking a beer.
  (4)     The man places the meat on the grill.
  (5)     The woman goes inside to set the table and check the vegetables.
  (6)     The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning.
  (7)     The man takes the meat off the grill and hands it to the woman.
  (8)     The woman prepares the plates and brings them to the table.
  (9)     After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.
  (10)   The man asks the woman how she enjoyed "her night off."  And, upon
           seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's just no
pleasing some women.

arvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually perfo=
rms well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the p=
ast. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Mannin=
g , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well =
the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots thr=
ee times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy =
Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in=
 practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to pract=
ice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on=
 whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill=
 Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wedne=
sday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday=
, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  T=
erry Glenn , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have anot=
her good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handlin=
g Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last=
 week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 =
yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him t=
o get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with I=
ndianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numb=
ers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the J=
ets! e! ngage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, becau=
se New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Col=
es , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to =
receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis de=
fenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , =
RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New=
 York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the cloc=
k against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/0=
1 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, b=
ut he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offe=
nse. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis=
 this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Upd=
ated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, compl=
eting 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, =
Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael W=
estbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less =
than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Caroli=
na. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still =
only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear U=
pdated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Lou=
is defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw=
 his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that=
! S! tephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consider=
ation at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 G=
ardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary o=
n Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in lar=
ger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the pot=
ential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. H=
e's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a w=
eekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Bruce h=
asn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever cons=
ider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable =
N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01=
 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this seas=
on. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable =
tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Fa! ul! k as St. Louis' featur=
ed back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the =
Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspec=
tive.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge n=
umbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every wee=
k. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be s=
ure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if =
he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coa=
ch Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will l=
ikely be the more productive of th! e ! two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PH=
I - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in =
the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Gia=
nts for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get =
him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/0=
1 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this=
 season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit s=
uspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated=
 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained med=
ial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatl=
ey will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable fo=
r Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PH=
I - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing so=
me solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the=
 league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly =
basis.   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE] 10/19 =

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

ail : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journ=
al Members:   Last week's Trading Alert on Petapeer Holdings (OTC BB: PETP)=
 was a failure. We hoped the unique news of the company's intention to file=
 a patent on its revenue generating technology would restore the stock to i=
ts previous high. Instead, the enhanced volume brought out sellers, and the=
 stock dropped. This demonstrates the importance of selling quickly when th=
ese stocks we feature in Trading Alerts go against us. You should have sold=
 the stock at $1.06 if you followed our advice, and gotten out with a small=
 but manageable loss. It's always preferable to be out wishing you were in,=
 rather than in wishing you were out.   In this edition we have a follow up=
 on XML technology in the news, and coverage on Energy Power's earnings ann=
ouncement which was issued yesterday.      [IMAGE] XML Global (OTC BB: XMLG=
) in Investor's Business Daily and Worth Magazine's Informative Article   L=
ate last year we were contacted by an associate in the computer industry wh=
o told us we needed to find a microcap stock with leading edge technology i=
n XML programming language. At the time we had no idea what XML was, but we=
 learned, loved it, and found a pure play in the microcap arena to cover.  =
 Information on the XML revolution is starting to appear in the main stream=
 financial media. Last Thursday's edition of the Investor's Business Daily =
contained an article which referenced our choice, XML Global Technologies (=
OTC BB: XMLG). Many thanks to the members who emailed us concerning our typ=
o in the weekend edition. We mistakenly printed the article was in the May =
12th edition. It was actually in the May 24th edition.   It's of no consequ=
ence as we have the article available for you in its entirety. Investors Bu=
siness Daily gave the company permission to post the article in PDF Format =
on its corporate web site. Simply click here  to go directly to it, or go X=
ML Global's investor relations section at their web site- Click Here  for t=
hat section.    In addition to the Investor's Business Daily article, June'=
s edition of Worth Magazine has a feature article entitled The XML Revoluti=
on. This article has an understandable explanation of XML- what it is, how =
it works, and how it will be used. This is a must read for anyone intereste=
d in the future of computer programming. Click Here  to read the article, o=
r go to the following URL: http://www.worth.com/content_articles/0601_xml_r=
evolution.html    XML Global Technologies has spent the last two years deve=
loping tools for programmers working on code for the XML revolution. We exp=
ect media attention to continue to grow in this arena, and hopefully we hav=
e identified an outstanding pure play for our members. Please read the arti=
cles and let us know if you agree. We are getting more excited as coverage =
of this new technology continues to accelerate.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Sy=

will be a bull market for North American energy related companies for the n=
ext two to five years. In the microcap arena, Energy Power Systems LTD is o=
ur contribution.   The company's market cap (only $18 million) leaves plent=
y of room for upside, and we are anticipating substantial growth in future =
quarters. New business will start to come out in the June and September qua=
rters, and their M&M Subsidiary is embarking on $5.5 million in new project=
s right now.   On Tuesday nine month financial performance was announced by=
 the company. Revenues were only up 9%, but the earnings turnaround was imp=
ressive. The company turned a small EBITDA profit of $100,000, but this com=
pares to a $1.3 million loss in year 2000. This is very positive news as st=

BUSINESS WIRE)--June 5, 2001--Energy Power Systems Limited (``EPS'' or the =
``Company'') (NASD Bulletin Board: EYPSF) (CDNX: YPS - news; www.epsx.com) =
announces that it has issued unaudited consolidated financial statements fo=
r the nine month period ended March 31, 2001. These statements reflect the =
following activities of EPS and its subsidiaries:    consolidated revenues =
of $15.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($13.9 million -2=
000); consolidated gross profits of $1.5 million for the nine months ended =
March 31, 2001 ($2.3 - 2000); consolidated EBITDA of $0.1 million for the n=
ine months ended March 31, 2001 ($1.3 million negative EBITDA -2000); conso=
lidated loss from continuing operations of $0.5 million for the nine months=
 ended March 31, 2001 ($2.0 million - 2000); and consolidated basic and ful=
ly diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.13 ($.63 per sha=
re - 2000).   EPS's consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine mon=
th period ending March 31, 2001 increased by 9% from the $13.9 million repo=
rted during the same period the previous year. Increased activity from the =
Company's Engineering and Offshore Division and new sources of revenue from=
 the Company's Oil and Gas Division that began operations February 1, 2001 =
contributed to this revenue growth.    Consolidated EBITDA of $100,000 for =
the nine-month period ending March 31, 2001 was positive versus consolidate=
d EBITDA of $(1.3) million reported for the previous nine-month period. The=
 consolidated EBITDA increase was largely due to the benefits of a corporat=
e restructuring initiated at the end of fiscal 2000 as well as the addition=
al cash flow from the introduction of the oil and gas division. ``It was ou=
r corporate objective at the end of last year to turn the Company cash flow=
 positive this fiscal year,'' stated Scott Hargreaves CFO, ``to achieve thi=
s we eliminated two non-core subsidiaries and created the Oil & Gas Divisio=
n. We are most pleased with the positive improvement in cash flow as EBITDA=

Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.
	2. SITARA #573532 should be Tiered Rate-Step:   5,000mmbtu/day @ $8.90
							10,000mmbtu/day @ $8.85

Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,
Doug  x3-0560

Subject:	Jan-01 Sales Price Discrp

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,

Important information from AT&T resources:  
 THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY  AT&T. DON'T EVER DIAL  
AREA CODE  809  
MAJOR SCAM:  
Don't respond to Emails, phone calls, or web pages which  tell you to call  
an "809" Phone  Number. This is a very important issue of Scam Busters  
because it alerts you to a scam that is  spreading *extremely* quickly can  
easily cost you $24100 or more, and is difficult to avoid unless you are  
aware of it. We'd like to thank  Verizon for bringing this scam  to our  
attention. This scam has also been identified by the National Fraud  
Information Center and is costing  victims a lot of money. There are lots of  
different permutations of this scam.  
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:  
You will receive a message on your answering  machine or your pager, which  
asks you to call a number beginning with area code 809. The reason you're  
asked to call varies. It can be  to receive information about a family  
member who has been ill, to tell you someone has been  arrested, died, to  
let you know  you have won a wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you are  
told to call the 809 number right away. Since there  are so many new area  
codes  these days, people unknowingly return these calls. If you call from  
the US, you will apparently be charged  $2425 per-minute. Or, you'll  get a  
long recorded message. The point is, they will try to keep you on the phone  
as long as possible  to increase the charges. Unfortunately, when you get  
your phone bill, you'll often be  charged more than  $24100.00.  
   
WHY IT  WORKS:  
   
The 809 area  code is located in the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas).  
The 809 area code can be used as a "pay-per-call"  number, similar to 900  
numbers  in the US. Since 809 is not in the US, it is not covered by U.S.  
regulations of 900 numbers, which require  that you be notified and warned  
of charges and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call" number. There is  
also no  requirement that the company provide a time period during which you  
may terminate the call  without being charged. Further,  whereas many U.S.  
homes that have 900 number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges, do not  
work in  preventing calls to the 809  area code. We recommend that no matter  
how you get the message, if you are asked to call a number with  an 809 area  
code that you don't  recognize just disregard the message. Be wary of email  
or calls asking you to call an 809 area code number.  It's important to  
prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying to fight the charges  
afterwards can become A real  nightmare. That's because you did actually  
make the call. If you complain, both your local phone  company and your long  
distance  carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell  
you that they are simply  providing the billing for the foreign company.  
You'll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done  
nothing  wrong.  
   
Please forward  this entire message to your friends, family and colleagues  
to help them  become aware of this  scam.  
Additional information can be obtained  from

Watch the Tigers Wreck the Rebels!
LSU vs. Ole Miss - October 27, 2001 @ 8:00pm
Come watch at Woodrow's under the big tent!

(Note that parking will be available in the office building next door as
well as the normal areas - coming from Richmond, go past the office
building next to Woodrow's and take a right to get to the parking garage.
Parking is available for cars and small SUV's - due to clearance
restrictions, large vehicles are not allowed to park in the garage)

For those unable to make it to Woodrow's, Nick's Place will be showing the
game as well.

Also, for our travelling Tigers, note the following construction update
from La. DOTD:

DOTD is doing roadwork on I-10 around the Hwy 165 area in Jeff Davis
Parish.
Houston-area Tiger fans should be advised to take evasive manuevers....i.e.
exit Iowa and head south to Hwy 90....go east on 90 to Welsh, and then back
to I-10.  See the link:

Will new technology improve storage economics? 
What new storage projects are in the works?

Please forward to Suzanne as well.  Will you review this spreadsheet for April penalties associated with Texaco?  The volumes and prices did not look correct to me.  Let me know and I will have Anne change the value.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the possible penalties we will be charging on the six PG&E Topock April Baseload load purchases that were severely cut throughout the month.  If we use the Gas Daily High Price plus $0.15, then the total penalties will be $2,032,902, but if we use the methodology described in the contract (Gas Daily), the total penalties will be $889,377.

I spoke to Phillip while you were out to see which method we should use. He said to wait until you returned.  I also verified with Darron that from a settlements perspective, we can send penalty invoices at any time.  Let's discuss when you return.  I have copies of all of the pertinent information.

Thanks

Anne

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles=
 Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Charger=
s. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett =
may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Update=
d 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half=
 of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a F=
antasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Mc=
Nair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due=
 to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Frid=
ay, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being=
 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smit=
h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sun=
day against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee=
. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wou=
ld "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambr=
ick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the =
stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11=
/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and=
 is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However,=
 if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,=
 Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth consideri=
ng as long as he's able to play.    ! Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Tori Updated 1=
1/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarter=
back for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth start=
ing on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/=
16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of c=
onsistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quart=
erbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your sta=
rting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16=
/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too g=
ood to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end =
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Gian=
ts' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/1=
6/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants d=
ue to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almos=
t impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy ! nu=
! mbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is =
one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use =
on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underac=
hieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB=
 NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco la=
st weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsis=
tent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to =
bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie =
Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game agains=
t San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. H=
e'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass =
in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davi=
s , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Up! da! ted 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play a=
fter beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his =
last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. G=
ive him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to=
 high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Ba=
nks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three gam=
es. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be =
beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantas=
y leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westb=
rook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown p=
asses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend th=
at is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth consid=
ering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has bee=
n held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 ya=
rds. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however,=
 so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him =
on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up a=
gainst a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outsid=
e of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt con=
tinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three=
 touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this week=
end, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potent=
ial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/0=
1 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still o=
ne of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formi=
dable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his pot=
ential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 =
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best F=
antasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post =
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him=
 on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at ti=
ght end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fant=
asy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russ=
ell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains=
t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin=
gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Haye=
s , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yard=
s last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners t=
his season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three =
weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had =
some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisabl=
e.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally ha=
d a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. =
Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San =
Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank =
Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the=
 league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulne=
rable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE G=
B - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers,=
 but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy playe=
r. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of ti=
ght end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fr=
ank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury repo=
rt, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play t=
his week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing t=
eams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/=
01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfiel=
d this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy va=
lue outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont=
 Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in =
place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split ca=
rries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in =

RB SEA - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected t=
o miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of=
 many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He shou=
ld roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB =
NE - The Executioners Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=
or now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any =
changes ! th! is week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy=
 starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy i=
f you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may=
 have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brune=
ll's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - N=
orth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficient=
ly healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not ex=
pected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander wi=
ll continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason =
comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 M=
ike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy invol=
ving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," h=
e said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none wit=
hin this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the=
 next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to sati=
sfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injur=
y. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener=
 is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone=
 Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra=
-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to=
 play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/! 01!  K=
inney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected =
to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd=
 Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice th=
is week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - North=
 Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was so=
re when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher n=
ow says he doesn't expect him to miss any prac! ti! ce time this week.   De=
rrick Alexander , WR KC - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) =
has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin =
Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is =
listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his=
 place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Updated! 1! 1/20/01 Wayne has =
a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orl=
eans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR =
IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. =
He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, mea=
ning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.=
   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told =
the Miami Herald there is no QB con! tr! oversy surrounding Fielder and bac=
kup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the s=
tarter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play =
turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Update=
d 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suf=
ficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get=
 a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denv=
er Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situat=
ion where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, th=
en we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - =
Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won=
't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get hi=
m involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett =
, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury l=
ast weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia.=
 However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this p=
oint.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setba=
cks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffer=
ed a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effe=
cts of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gree=
n , WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to re=
turn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this=
 season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , =
WR SF - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee an=
d ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina=
. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to=
 be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI =
- One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during S=
unday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expe=
cted to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real =
value as a Fantasy playe! r,! but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    G=
iants , DT NYG - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 According to the N=
ew York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee bega=
n giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure=
 that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday nigh=
t, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should=
 consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   =
Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end =
Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surg=
ery. ! Hi! s loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore def=
ense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, wh=
o was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get th=
e start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denv=
er's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' d=
efense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake =
Pit Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Den=
ver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told=
 the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due =
to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. =
    Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bru=
ised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some prac=
tice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta=
. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could t=
urn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after =
missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to p=
lay on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Co=

----------
What a GREAT snapshot in history! Thanks, Joey for finding Ken's FIJI Journal. 
This really hit home since this was written when Tan Dan began bringing the Baton Rouge seniors (Broadmoor High School) around to meet the Brothers. We met a great group of guys; went to the intramural games; drank a lot on Friday afternoon at the Bayou; and of course went to much of FIJI Island. We added a few kegs to the parties and allowed a few thousand $$s to be added to the social budget. The events and accomplishments listed in this epistle were why the nine of us joined that year (I pray I'm not leaving anyone out)! Bankston; DePerrie squared; Polito, Cooper, Pratt, Fontaine, Ragusa and me! (too bad we couldn't persuade Ritchie to come over from the Dark Side [Sigma Chi]) We were merged with a great pledge class from all over the country. It began a fun four years (five for some of us)! 
If I remember correctly, with our 50 or so pledges, the chapter moved into the 'Large Frat' category? Seemed we did pretty well on that level too! 
Hey Pledge Class of 1979-80 (or any of the others for that matter) - send in your favorite piece of Beta Rho history that YOU were a part of!!!! It will be fun to relive those years a little. 
Bob, could you please post this to your distribution list and yahoo page? Thanks. 
Bid Night: shirt torn-off, chug a beer for FIJI, fraternally yours, 
Zuc 
Perge'!

It looks like Chuck (tulane) has moved from Cajun JR. to Cajun SR. and Val
(lsu) has been relegated to Cajun JR. from his previous Cajun SR. status on
the eDownstream project.

I think Val had sent me this image (attached) last week.
It is appropriate to send it back to him, because the image is garbage now.
Just like the Tigers baseball team - tossed aside like garbage.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp.

While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might=
 have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff=
 didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated =
10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the =
Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week,=
 in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Who's Y=
o Daddy Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so =
far. He could have a g! oo! d week if the Jets engage in a shootout with th=
e Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gamepla=
n around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - oops, I did it again =
Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but mi=
ght be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able t=
o match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - The Snake Pit Update=
d 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week=
. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   S=
tephen Davis , RB WAS - The Executioners Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his fir=
st decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a ver=
y risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolin=
a is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants=
 consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks w=
as very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes=
 for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even wort=

ng in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Fat Bastards Update=
d 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis de=
fense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his =
first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tigh! t ! end now that =
Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideratio=
n at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01=
 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary=
 on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in l=
arger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updated 10/18/01 Holt h=
as the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on=
 Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lin=
eup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 10/18/=
01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to=
 ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the que=
stionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - The Fat Bastards =
Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy persp=
ective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have =
a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - The E=
xecutioners Updated 10/18/01 C! anidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk =
as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a go=
od knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week fr=
om a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warn=
er is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the Ne=
w York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhal=
ter , RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to =
start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Mon=
day night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the=
 backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more p! ro! ductive of the tw=
o backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/18/0=
1 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth star=
ting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around=
 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd =
Pinkston , WR PHI - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly be=

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

Oliver North  
April 20, 2001  
Military illiteracy  
Washington, DC -- The April 1 collision between a People's Liberation Air  
Force F-8 fighter and a US Navy EP-3 over the South China Sea has revealed a  
striking military weakness. As the 11-day standoff over the fate of 24 of our  
military personnel detained by the communist Chinese unfolded, the masters of  
the media went into high gear to explain to the American people what was  
going on. The potentates of the press did an adequate job of reporting on the  
political dynamic in our nation's capital; on the diplomatic exchanges  
between Beijing and Washington; and on the anxieties of loved ones waiting at  
home. But when it came to reporting on the military aspects of the incident,  
they failed miserably. Strangely enough, almost no one noticed -- in large  
part because the American media and the American people suffer from the same  
malady: military illiteracy. Some examples: From the day of the collision  
onward, nearly every US media outlet referred repeatedly to the damaged US  
aircraft -- a 45-year old, four-engine turbo-prop -- as a "spy-plane." It's  
not. A "spy plane" (the U-2 or SR-71, for example) is designed to overfly an  
adversary's territory. The sturdy old EP-3 however, is designated as a  
"reconnaissance and surveillance" aircraft, and it conducts its mission of  
collecting electronic emissions by flying in international airspace or over  
"friendly territory." The difference between "surveillance aircraft" and "spy  
plane" is not a simple matter of semantics -- it is an important distinction  
that affords the EP-3 and its crew protections in international law. Not  
unexpectedly, the use of the term "spy plane" in the US media was immediately  
picked up by the international press and Communist China's propaganda  
machine. A less egregious example of military illiteracy is evident in  
listening to what the media call those who serve in the Armed forces. At  
various times during the 11 days our 24 military personnel were detained,  
network newsreaders referred to them as "soldiers" or "troops," and  
occasionally as "intelligence specialists." The cable "news hounds" made  
similar errors last October, when terrorists attacked the USS Cole in Yemen  
and the masters of the media repeatedly described the sailors killed and  
wounded aboard the vessel as "soldiers." It is tempting to ascribe these  
inaccuracies to media malevolence, an undercurrent of antipathy toward the US  
military. And members of the armed forces can perhaps be forgiven their  
paranoia when they are treated to "investigative reports" like CNN's  
"Tailwind" broadcast, in which it was falsely alleged that US forces employed  
Sarin nerve gas against US "defectors" in Vietnam. But in fact, it appears  
that most of the factual errors in today's media coverage of our military  
stem less from malice than from ignorance. And that's not just a media  
problem -- it's becoming a national predicament. How is it that so many know  
so little about military life today that they cannot distinguish between a  
"soldier" and a "sailor"? The answer lies in part with the "success" of the  
"all volunteer force" -- now in its 26th year. Once we abandoned selective  
service -- the draft -- military recruiters were forced to appeal to an  
increasingly narrow cross-section of young Americans to fill the ranks. Gone  
is the challenge of patriotism and service that had motivated young men from  
all walks of life to join the military. Douglas MacArthur's "Duty, honor,  
County" was replaced with a bald bounty system. Sheer greed -- cold hard cash  
-- became the Pentagon's answer to enlisting those with critical skills  
essential to today's increasingly complex and technology-based military. In  
1963, when my Naval Academy classmates and I first swore to "support and  
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  
domestic ..." it was the commander in chief who administered the oath. Many  
have found fault with John Kennedy since that day, but not in his appeal that  
we should "ask not what our country can do for you, but what you can do for  
your country." That sentiment is heard no longer. And the effect is seen not  
just in military recruiting shortfalls, but throughout our society. General  
James L. Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, recently noted that, "The  
average citizen, even the average congressman, neither knows nor cares about  
national security ..." and that "congressmen and senators no longer vie for  
seats on the House or Senate Armed Services Committees." He's right. Fewer  
than one in 10 new recruits even knows a military veteran, and only four out  
of 100 Americans personally know someone in uniform. It should be instructive  
that the military hero of the moment, Navy Lt. Shane Osborn, who saved the  
lives of his EP-3 crew by successfully piloting his badly damaged aircraft to  
a safe landing, says that he was motivated to become a flyer by his high  
school football coach, an Air Force veteran. But Osborn's experience is  
increasingly rare. Today, many educators, especially those who came of age  
during the "Vietnam era," remain hostile to military service and even go so  
far as to deny military recruiters access to high schools. George Orwell  
wrote, "We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night  
to visit violence on those who would do us harm." If we expect to remain safe  
in our beds, we would do well to get smart about our armed forces

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I don't know if you've seen it yet, but one of the programmers that works
for me burned me a copy of XP a couple of weeks ago . . . don't really know
how he got his hands on it, but it's pretty cool . . . I have to upgrade my
burner software due to compatibility issues . . . is your burner software
Roxio?  If so, I need you to burn me a copy . . . I'll burn you a copy of
XP if you're interested . . . the first 64 byte OS

  Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC J=
ournal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement     When I look back on a=
ll these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathb=
ed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which never happen=
ed. Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour  We are working on a very =
special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters. The last three weeks h=
ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid=
es straight down.   There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1=
% of their previous highs. Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m=
inimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will =
review the rule early next year.   Unlike most market environments, individ=
ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a=
t these levels. Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not=
 allowed to hold stocks. Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others=
 have a $1 threshold. Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes=
e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes agains=
t their personal wishes and their own common sense. Fund managers will be a=
ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above $1 and $5.   =
We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove=
rsold. In order to make the list, the stock must be trading below the cash =
value the company has per share, and have little or no debt. We will try to=
 publish this exciting edition next weekend. We might call it the "Riskless=
 Rebound" edition. Stayed tuned.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems (OTC BB: =
EYPSF) Updated Profile [IMAGE]  Followers of Energy Power know it has been =
trading up and down the charts over the last 2 weeks. We are suggesting the=
 company change its symbol to OTIS as the stock goes up and down like an Ot=
is Elevator.   For investors looking for more information on Energy Power, =
the editors of the OTC Journal have updated our original profile to reflect=
 changing corporate events subsequent to the original release on February 1=
2th.   Click Here  to review the updated profile. If you never read our ori=
ginal release this would be an excellent opportunity to familiarize yoursel=
f with this company.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Update=
 [IMAGE]  Our inbox is filled with questions on Envoy as the stocks fades i=
nto the oblivion of the $1 range. The stock is behaving as if there is some=
thing wrong with the company.   We spoke with management briefly this week =
about this issue. At the corporate level nothing has changed. Fiscal 2001, =
which ended at the end of September, still looks like roughly $10 million C=
DN in EBITDA profits. As of right now, business for fiscal 2002 looks about=
 the same as 2001. The stock is trading at about 3 times 2002 EBITDA. The i=
ndustry average is currently 11 times 2002 EBITDA.   What's the explanation=
 for this pathetic performance? Simple- management is doing nothing at this=
 time to market their company to investors. Their only audience is the memb=
ers of the OTC Journal.   A plan for a nationwide institutional road show w=
as in place prior to Attack on America, but that is now on hold. We can onl=
y hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareh=
olders and get proactive in telling their story.    Tax selling could hurt =
this stock, so it could go lower. One can only hope that despite management=
's failure to get out and tell their story, someone will come along and rec=
ognize the inherent value in this company.   Bottom line- Not worth selling=
 at this price, but it could go lower.     [IMAGE] Attention Football Fans =

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or reha! bi! litate=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the=
 Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack C=
rockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matt=
y Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=
lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =
from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/=
16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin=
nati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri=
lls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n=
ot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm=
itt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the li=
neup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained ri=
ght knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that S=
mith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Tr=
oy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back agai=
nst the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Fr=
iday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  =
However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league th=
is week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth c=
onsidering as long as he's able to play.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Upd=
ated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting q=
uarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth=
 starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lac=
k of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better=
 quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in yo=
ur starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated=
 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still=
 too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding th=
e end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and th=
e Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Update=
d 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Gi=
ants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's=
 almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantas=
y numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams i=
s one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to us=
e on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been under=
achieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , =
QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco =
last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit incons=
istent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough t=
o bench him, especially against a vulnerable In! di! anapolis defense.    W=
illie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game =
against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiv=
ing. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the=
 pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephe=
n Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play=
 after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over hi=
s last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.=
 Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable =
to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 =
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three g=
ames. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can b=
e beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fant=
asy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent ! Updated 11/16/01 W=
estbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdo=
wn passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weeken=
d that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth co=
nsidering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has=
 been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 3=
8 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, howe=
ver, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKa!=
 y ! Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so start=
ing him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll=
 go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using hi=
m outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 =
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored on=
ly three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t=
his weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on hi=
s potential to put up solid numbers.   Is! aa! c Bruce , WR STL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but =
he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law a=
nd the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting base=
d on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is stil=
l the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and =
should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie! C! onwel=
l  , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks,=
 so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lac=
k of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is som=
ething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley=
 , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter thi=
s weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carrie=
s with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possibl=
e.   Donald Hayes , ! WR! CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two =
catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable f=
or Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley =
Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check o=
ver the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in th=
e league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so start=
ing him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 =
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75=
 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this we=
ek's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Fav=
re , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy =
quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunda=
y with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   =
Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up hu=
ge ! ya! rdage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a=
 valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, F=
ranks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill=
 Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed=
 on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlan=
ta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnera=
ble to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  Schedule, Break=

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you and I
didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first half
to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
stripper to go back to your place with you?

Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
8:00p.

Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are staying
here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

A cabbie picks up a nun. She gets into the cab, and the cab driver won't 
stop staring at her. She asks him why is he staring and he replies, "I have 
a question to ask you but I don't want to offend you."  She answers, "My 
dear son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a 
nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about 
everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that would 
find offensive." 
"Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me." 
She responds, "Well, let's see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be 
single and #2 you must be Catholic." 
The cab driver is very excited and says, "Yes, I am single and I'm Catholic 
too!" 
"OK" the nun says "Pull into the next alley" He does and the nun fulfills 
his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. But when they get 
back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. "My dear child, said the 
nun, why are you crying?" 
"Forgive me sister, but I have sinned. I lied, I must confess, I'm married 
and I'm Jewish." 
The nun says, "That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm on my way to a Halloween 
party."

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

A sad commentary on the economy....


If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago,
it would now be worth $49.

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the
stock) one year ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the
cans for the nickel deposit, you would have $79.

My advice to you is to start drinking heavily.

wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upda=

for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman ,=
 RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman =

s unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at A=

/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed =

, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent =
Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The=

I got a response on the same day you sent it to them.  I think it is automatically generated.  Thanks again for passing it on.  I will be busting my ass to find a job after my vacation and will be much more proactive.  It's hard to try too hard knowing you will be out of the country for two weeks.   I will keep you posted.  I will have access to this shitty email account overseas.  Talk to you later.  By the way, this is what they sent me.
 
Dear Andy Shackouls,

   Matt,
   To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing
   independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability
   is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me
   get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My
   resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.
   DAS
   P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure
   how I feel about that.

Hey all,

Sunday is Shanna's 30th B-day so we are going to celebrate Saturday night.  We were planning on meeting up at my new place for drinks @ around 9:00 and then heading over to the Black Swan around 10:30.  Let me know if you care to join.

My new place is at Gables Pin Oak Park - 4848 Pin Oak Park #1503.

Directions from Downtown - take 59 south and exit Newcastle , take a left on Newcastle and follow past Westpark about a quarter mile . You will see several complexes ahead.  Take a right on Pin Oak Park.  Complex will be on the right.

Call on my cell phone if you have problems 713-628-3104.

Let me know if you can come.

-Eric

   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn John=
son , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of =
Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right kne=
e bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a so=
re right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in =
the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying t=
hat it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not =
have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith=
 , RB DAL - ! Ro! cks Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite =
having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over A=
rizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all r=
ight," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree=
 the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off the=
 field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New =
York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, b=
ut said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepp=
er , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 According to published report=
s, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He =
is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - FIBSABs=
 Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England=
, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  stati=
stical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB D=
EN - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr=
ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the B! ro!=
 ncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap=
pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W=
R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he =
remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - The K=
lap Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denv=
er. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a =
big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedul=
e.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes=
 for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, bu=
t now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is fi=
nally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , =
TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Jones overc! am! e a sprained ankle to =
play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his ca=
tches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers=
 on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tig=
ht end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF =
- Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards =
on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfi=
eld to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from =
Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart  Updated 10/28/=
01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Pri=
ce is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for F=
antasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two =
TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing=
 key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexa=
nder , RB SEA - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=
 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan=
der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat=
tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better =
defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Up=
dated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami'=
s No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fanta=
sy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Baja Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught=
 eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The=
 Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron D=
ayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 ya=
rds on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good =
numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toom=
er , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109=
 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player,=
 no matte! r ! what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenha=
rt Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was =
held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but t=
he Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the b=
all.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 1=
90 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the err=
atic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Stale=
y , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakla=
nd but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catc=
hes for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, an=
d should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that C=
orrell Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that ne=
ither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts. =
 Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21=
 times for 77 yards and a touchdown ! Su! nday at Philadelphia. This outing=
 could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone W=
heatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 10/28=
/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in=
 Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagle=
s' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future wee=
ks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for=
 just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get=
 intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats agains=
t the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a=
 bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fa=
ntasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB=
 ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 y=
ards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this se=
ason, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option fo=
r the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated 10/2=
8/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. Wh=
ile Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspe=
ctive, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks =
in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team=
.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yar=
ds, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further=
 exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwi=
se, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys=
 , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to t=
hree points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the gam=
e. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective base=
d on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing th=
at this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint St=
oerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 pa=
sses for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seve=
n times for 23 yards and a score in Sun! da! y's game against Arizona. Thes=
e numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak =
Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on th=
is outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunda=
y's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injur=
y after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated s=
hortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left=
 Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was ta=
ken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by =
Alex Van Pelt before he returned.  More Updates  View Transactions  [IMAGE]=

what's his new job . . . table cloth ironer?  Kennison turned out to be a
real disaster.  I'm beginning to think that many of our recent free agents
are turning out to be other team's trash.  I guess the Tractor Traylor is
not washed up, and he's a big reason why Chicago has turned it around.
Though he did get on Shanny's bad side during Pryce's holdout with some
things he said.  We used to have this guy named Shannon Sharpe.  He's pretty
good too.  If only i could say fuck it all and just  go skiing, but it's
been 70 degrees here for 5 weeks.  It's time Shanny hires me to help him
out.

Little Johnny


LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE CONDOM
Little Johnny walked into his dad's bedroom one day only to catch him
sitting on the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his penis in
preparation of sex with his wife. Johnny's father in an attempt to hide his
full erection with a condom on it bent over as if to look under the bed.
Little Johnny asked curiously "What ya doin dad? His father quickly
replied, "I thought I saw a rat go underneath the bed." To which Little
Johnny replied "What ya gonna do, fuck him?"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND THE VAGINA
Little Johnny's mother decided to give her son an anatomy lesson one day,
so she took off all of her clothes and pointed to her vagina, and said,
"Johnny, this is where you come from." Johnny went to school the next day
smiling and insisting that all his friends now refer to him as Lucky Johnny
"Why?" one asked. Johnny held his fingers an inch apart and said, "Because
I came this close to being a turd."

LITTLE JOHNNY, THE SMART ASS
A traveling salesman rings the doorbell and 10-year-old Little Johnny
answers, holding a beer and smoking a fat cigar.  The salesman says, little
boy, is your mother home?" Little Johnny taps his ash on the carpet and
says, "What the fuck do you think?"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND TEACHERS
Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic
"Why?"  asks the father. "The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3?' I said '6'"
"But that's right!"  "Then she asked me 'How much is 3x2?'" "What's the
fucking difference?"  asks the father. "That's what I said!" replied Little
Johnny

JOHNNY AND THE MULTI-SYLLABLE WORD
Little Johnny goes to school, and the teacher says, 'Today we are going to
learn multi-syllable words, class. Does anybody have an example of a
multi-syllable word?' Little Johnny waves his hand, 'Me, Miss Rogers,  me,
me!' Miss
Rogers: All right, little Johnny, what is your multi-syllable word?  Little
Johnny says, 'Mas-tur-bate.' Miss Rogers smiles and says,'Wow, little
Johnny, that's a mouthful.' Little Johnny says, 'No, Miss Rogers,you're
thinking of a blowjob."

LITTLE JOHNNY AND BABIES
Little Johnny came running into the house and asked, "Mommy, can little
girls have babies?" "No," said his Mom, "of course not." Little Johnny
then ran back outside and his Mom heard him yell to his friends, "It's
okay, we can play that game again!"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GOING TO THE BATHROOM
Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed to
go to the bathroom. He yelled out, "Miss Jones, I need to take a piss!" The
teacher replied, "Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in this
situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please use the
word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to go." Little
Johnny thinks for a bit, then says, "You're an eight too, but if you had
bigger tits, you'd be a ten!"

LITTLE JOHNNY AND GRAMMAR
One day, during a lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show of
hands from those who could use the word "beautiful" in the same sentence
twice. First, she called on little Suzy, who responded with, "My father
bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it." "Very
good, Suzy," replied the teacher. She then called on little Michael. "My
mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully," he
said.   "Excellent, Michael!" Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.
"Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was
pregnant,  and he said, 'Beautiful, .......just fucking beautiful!'"

xpected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris =
, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right ham=
string during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the =
contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updat=
ed 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching sev=
en passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the ga=
me, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free A=
gent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enoug=

Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. Th=
e team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he=
'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Free =
Agent Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coa=
ch's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering=
 from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might=
 have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson=
's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent  Upda=

Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback=
 for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fan=

ry. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at th=

uffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washingt=

 Fear Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game=
 against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is uncl=
ear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Klap Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed fo=
r only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th=
e ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy o=
f a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work=
 at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing def=
enses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open oft=
en after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 11=
/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by De=
troit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a b=
etter game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 1=
1/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23=
 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is ver=
y thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan ca=
ught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desper=
ate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Char=
lie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rus=
hed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and =
a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near =
the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest =
of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 11/18/01 Dunn c=
aught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 =
yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy =
numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erra=
tic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Do! gs! Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caugh=
t 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end=
 zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is v=
ery thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is no=
t consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and=
 three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fa=

here is a message from norm bacon.  if anyone is interested please contact
the names below or you can reply via e-mail to me if you want:

basically, the pl is a "big brother" to the undergraduate chapter.  the pl
needs to provide guidance to the chapter in areas of fraternity policy, risk
management, the ritual, rush, and chapter finances.  he needs to attend at
least one (1) chapter meeting per month.  ideally, this man is 25 - 30 years
old; he needs to be able to relate to the chapter on a personal level, while
guiding them in the areas, above.  he does not need to be an expert in these
areas.  he needs to be an influence in both good times and bad times.  it
would also be helpful for him to possess or establish a good rapport with
the
greek affairs office and the dean of students.

the ug chapter has been without an involved pl since 1998; they hold one
chapter meeting per month; the only time the ritual is used is for
initiation.  the payroll checks bounced in september and the kitchen was
temporarily closed in late september - early october.

bob, thank you, for posting the search on your list.  please refer any

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

ber 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb=
 the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now a=
ppreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brow=
n IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.=
84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, =
and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed th=
e portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to=
 the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is con=
siderably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ m=
arket has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probab=
ly a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are lo=
oking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now a=
nd the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pu=
llback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.   To view=

 opportunity. If the stock drops dramatically again as the result of anothe=

results, which are as follows:   Consolidated revenues were $5.5 million, u=

million, up from $.70 million last year (up 43%). Consolidated EBITDA profi=

creasing profits going forward. Click Here  to read the entire news release=

 XML Global's fortunes are turning back up. After making a 300% move in fiv=
e trading days, the stock has pulled back a little and quieted down, provid=
ing an excellent entry level for investors looking for powerful turn around=
 situations in the speculative end of the market.   Recent corporate develo=
pments support the notion that now is the time to accumulate this stock. Si=
nce the beginning of November the company has announced three major new con=
tracts- One with the city of Vancouver, one with the Canadian Federal Gover=
nment, and one with HomeSource Capital.    The OTC Journal believes the Hom=
eSource Capital contract to be the most important. XML is viewed by many as=
 the future of interserver communication between corporate computer systems=
. Corporate expansion has slowed to a crawl during this recession, but as s=

market share.   While most large corporations are embroiled in a bottoming =

Stephanie-

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it. 

Thank you, 

Matt Lenhart

layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 10/23/01 According to th=
e Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters =
will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be =
another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holm=
gren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lin=
eup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in=
 and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play =
again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both =
backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from=
 Alexander down the stretch.!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated =
10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He =
has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fa=
ntasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday'=
s game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He repla=
ces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pu=
lled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a ! Fa!=
 ntasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - F=
ear Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next =
Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the =
extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward =
, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to=
 a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't =
a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA =
- Fear Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injur=
y. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to us=
e him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chief=
s Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chri=
s Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you us=
e either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly impo=
sing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome =
Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/23/01! Pathon might miss his thi=
rd straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don'=
t use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 10/23/01=
 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r=
ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell=
 Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunda=
y's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee su=
rgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He!=
 w! ill work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda=
y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea=
gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and =
is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 10/=
23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring =
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the w=
eek, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duc=
e Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's gam=
e against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball=
 just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie =
Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carr! ie! s late in the game.=
 At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy n=
umbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replace=
ment.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a n=
eck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the inju=
ry report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this=
 week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is=
 recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game ag=
ainst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie Georg=
e , RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday=
's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TE=
N - Rocks Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a resul=
t of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week'=
s game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tenness=
ean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiv=
er is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of =
rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. =
Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday=
. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. =
  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ru=
led out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's g=
ame remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increas=
e his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The =
Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play.=
 Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make =
some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has =
been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Nort=
hcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game b=
ecause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to ac=
tion next week.   Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap di=
d not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is=
 optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been in=
active for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen ,=
 RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play =
of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's gam=
e. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Upda! te! d 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects=
 Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterb=
ack wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest a=
rea," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartil=
age. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wai=
t and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. =
    Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a cal=
f injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is=
 expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Tr=
ung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Lo=
uis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk=
 this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for=
 this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I wo=
uld be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he d=
oesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday a=
gainst the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again th=
is week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent=
 much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being co=
mpletely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing=
 for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day," Stokes told the=
 Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 perce=
nt but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don=
't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliabl=
e.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard cont=
inues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup.=
 Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night again=
st Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almos=
t completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dix=
on missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a spra=
ined ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - =
McKay Neal Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is qu=
estionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same=
 posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall =
to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be =
convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again =

As gameday approaches I'm seriously considering driving in for the game Sat
morning . . . Everyone I know is gonna be in BR this weekend . . . It's
going to be an awesome game and BR will be fun as hell sat night . . . I
think Hull is leaning toward doing that as well . . . why don't you suck it
up and come along for the ride . . . we've got 4 tix between Mitch, You,
Hull, and me, so we're covered there . . . we can stay at my buddy's house
who lives right off Acadian . . . There will be a ton of hot ass very drunk
in BR . . .

Also, I've got a hot friend who lives in Atlanta that I'm thinking about
flying up to see . . . she wants me to come in for the Auburn/Georgia game
in Athens on Nov. 10 . . . they're taking a bus from Atlanta to Athens and
back . . . you interested?

Yo Smokey- wait no, let me correct, Smoke-free:

Count me in on that bro.  I'll be there with bells on.  I want to reserve my
spot in the "Married Dorm" with hopes of getting cool make out with Tanya
and maybe engage in some naughty conversation (one word or two) with Shawna.
(Sorry Myers, she is tired of hearing that Mike Foster and Cleo Fields are
in your study group)

Don't bother in booking me a flight, I'll just ride my motorbike straight to
the slope.  I hear the ride to BR is a bitch but clears up shortly after.  I
would ask the lovely Gooch to accompany me on the glorious journey but don't
currenly have a side car for my nut-rocket.  Don, if work is a little slow,
maybe you can work me up a bid on a matching yellow/black side car. Or,
perhaps Ross can calculate the cost of renting a Harley to Colorado (the one
with the side car, please)

Anyways, hope this trip materializes. Sounds like a kick ass time.

layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According =
to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Wat=
ters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which coul=
d be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"=
 Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into th=
e lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has co=
me in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll =
play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash =
both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=
 from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injur=
y. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on =
any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Up=
dated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Su=
nday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He =
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with=
 a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om!=
 a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ=
 - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable fo=
r next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determi=
ne the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedri=
c Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice=
 due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and=
 isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , =
RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a=
n ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=
 afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start =
ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't rec=
ommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary i=
s hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this w=
eek.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss =
his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foo=
t. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to=
 broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.=
  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targetin=
g Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic =
knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h=
! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by =
Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fan=
tasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running b=
ack and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/=
23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring =
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the w=
eek, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duc=
e Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game a=
gainst the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball ju=
st three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Cor=
rell Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At=
 this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numb=
ers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacemen=
t.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a nec=
k injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney=
 , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury=
 report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this w=
eek's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is r=
ecovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game agai=
nst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George =
, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's=
 game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result=
 of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's=
 game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennesse=
an reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receive=
r is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of r=
est, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. R=
ookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free =
Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday.=
 An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  =
 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out o=
f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai=
ns uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe=
rcises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T=
imes-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=
 is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=
 of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inac=
tive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , W=
R CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of=
 a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next=
 week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play=
 Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimisti=
c that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for=
 the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - =
Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game=
 with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookin=
s will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -=
 Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Su=
nday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm =
day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. =
"There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up =
a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunni=
ngham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR S=
TL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday=
's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be availa=
ble for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL =
- Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canida=
te is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New=
 Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike M=
artz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we'=
ve got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate pr=
oved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and shou=
ld be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes =
, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending =
to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully =
the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! =
to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practi=
ced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes =
has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter=
 unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Ru=
ssell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now =
back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catche=
s for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though h=
is surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR N=
YG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to t=
he Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-=
to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Hea=
d Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orl=
eans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said=
. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to=
 be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." T=

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

 Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve=
 Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until=
 he is effective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 10=
/18/01 According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pi=
ck up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia =
is dealing with a sore throwing elbow,! a! s well as a few other nagging bu=

acksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF =
- Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against =
Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injur=
y-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF -! T! he Guzzlers Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but =
that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack =
an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE=
 Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - The Executioners Updated 10/18/01 T=
here's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quart=
erback this week .     Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the=
 injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, thr=
ow or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just h=
and off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. =
  Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable=
 for his return.   !   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/1=
8/01 Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly =
miss the next game because of an injured right knee.          "Tyrone Wheat=
ley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his =
MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionab=
le for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about =
the injury as the week progressed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley woul=
d be out four weeks.   "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden s=
aid.     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat =
out practice Wednesday and it's uncert! ai! n whether he will play in Washi=
ngton on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than =
the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thi=
gh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't k=
now if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke=
 cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01 G=
riese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'l=
l play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of shoulder soreness a=
fter a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggrav=
ated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive e=
nd Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. =
    Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey=
 missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprai! ne! d ankle, but he's expecte=
d to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing thi=
s weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if =
he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore=
 (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. H=
e hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his=
 status is downgraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - =
oops, I did it again Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in=
 practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. =
However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin=
 Muhammad , WR CAR - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are =
still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orlean=
s. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited=
. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may wan=
t to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR=
 - The Lie Downs Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due t=
o a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie qua=
rterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback t=
his week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. !  T=
erance Mathis , WR ATL - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (ha=
nd) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday ag=
ainst New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fa=
ntasy perspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01=
 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in=
 the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable=
 to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01!  =
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was=
 filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swoll=
en right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas,=
 but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - =
Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Ha=
mbrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes =
of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal =
at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 10! /1=
! 7/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay du=
e to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travi=
s Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss =
, WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for =
Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normall=
y tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activat=
e him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews=
 , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tue=
sday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fa=
ntasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Accord=
ing to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday a=
t San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mi=
ke Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use D=
avis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend =
you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kill Cul=
t Updated 10/17/01  Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expe=
ct him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the=
 Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 10/1=
7/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looke=
d like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well t=
his week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. H=
e will catch of couple of passes but won't! f! ind his way into the end zon=
e.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is n=
o longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. L=
ook for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JA=
C - One Man Show Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's =
game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ=
ctive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smi=
th , WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very c=
onsistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a tou=
chdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/0=
1 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his=
 hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is m=
uch worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We bel=
ieved it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the mus=

to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football =
until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a=
 sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. How=

st Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Price=
 might post respectable numbers against ! th! e Jaguars. Jacksonville's sec=
ondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Up=
dated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look =
for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars s=
econdary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Centers has=
 been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change =
against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguar=
s secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bl=
edsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 There's a very slim chance Bledsoe=
 will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week .     Bledsoe wa=
s upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 =
pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a st=
ationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No.=
 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's progress has been slo=
wer than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return.     Tyrone Wheat=
ley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice dur=
ing the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an=
 injured right knee.          "Tyrone Wheatley has a second degre! e ! - I =
don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said=
 Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at P=
hiladelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progr=
essed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   "I wo=
uld not agree with that at this time," Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's=
 uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh =
injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifer=
t said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to prac=
tice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursd=
ay. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.  Brian Griese , QB DE=
N - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has impro=
ved and! h! e's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese com=
plained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on =
Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf b=
y Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no struc=
tural damage to his shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 10/17/0=
1 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained an=
kle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in =
danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green wo=
uld replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don'=
t be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two day! s.!   Pat=
rick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw ext=
ensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against=
 New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspec=
tive.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs ar=
e still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orle=
ans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limit=
ed. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may w=
ant to consider benching Muhammad if at a! ll! possible.   Chris Weinke , Q=
B CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due=
 to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie q=
uarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback=
 this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   =
Terance Mathis , WR ATL - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returne=
d to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New O=
rleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy persp=
ective.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson=
 (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the start=
ing lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fa=
ntasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked =
with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in =
for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right kne=
e. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has =
no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is ex=
pected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brillianc=
e at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this poin=
t.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is list=
ed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle inj=
ury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as =
his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shiv=
ely Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game again=
st Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start=
 him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it=
 becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to=
 his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terr=
ell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/17/01 According to published repo=
rts, Davis would like to return to the lineup! S! unday at San Diego. He ha=
s recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants =
him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, al=
though this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Bron=
cos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Mack=
 will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too product=
ive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Ke=
enan McCardell , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 McCardell strugg=
led in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self i=
n the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a =
lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 D=
awkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of c=
ouple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , =
QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by h=
eadaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ove=
r 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17=
/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and=
 is listed as probable. He w! on! 't be too productive if he does play. Bra=
dy only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated=
 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch=
 several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR D=
ET - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the seaso=
n after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We'=
re disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach=
 Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showe=
d a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy t=
eam. Larr! y ! Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wh=
eatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 According to published r=
eports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. Th=
e veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he wa=
s hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 The Cont=
ra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley =
as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was =
reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  More Updates  Pla=
yer News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matt Lenhart Player News  Eric Moulds , Active WR =
Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Loo=
k for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars=
 secondary.  Peerless Price , Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 Price might post =
respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin b=
ecause of injuries.  Kerry Collins , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Collins co=
mpleted 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday against St.=
 Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise despite his=
 decent numbers against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 10/14=
/01 According to the Washington Post, coach Marty Schottenheimer will give =
Davis more carries on Monday against Dallas. Davis has struggled thus far, =
but it's been less about him and more about the Redskins tendency to fall b=
ehind the opposition early in games. If ever there was a week to start Davi=
s, this is it.   Johnnie Morton , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Morton has de=
veloped into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is worth taking a c=
hance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay in a deeper lea=
gue and don't have more reliable options, Morton is definittly worth consid=
ering this week.   Cris Carter , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Carter has stru=
ggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis. Look for him to fi=
nd the end zone against Detroit on Sunday.   Isaac Bruce , Active WR Update=
d 10/12/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too tal=
ented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against=
 CB Jason Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary.   Corey Dillon=
 , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this we=
ek. The Browns defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a re=
ceiver will be enough to give him a productive week.   Rickey Dudley , Rese=
rve TE Updated 10/09/01 The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve wi=
th a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your =
Fantasy roster.  Tony Banks , Reserve QB Updated 10/07/01 Banks was horribl=
e against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only 151 yards and two i=
nterceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside o=
f deeper leagues.   Steve Beuerlein , Active QB Updated 10/05/01 The Bronco=
s placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his season. He has =
been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't worth holding=
 on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your league.  Dolphin=
s , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 Linebacker Zach Thomas suffered a partially =
torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during Sunday's loss to St=
. Louis. "It's just real sore," Thomas told the Miami Herald. "I'm going to=
 try to play [Sunday]." His knee is very stiff right now, however, so don't=
 be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East contest against New =
England.   Raiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE T=
race Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendo=
n in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be pla=
ced on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roder=
ick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after =
sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sun=
day after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Matt Stover , Acti=
ve K Updated 12/08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the fina=
l three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Ol=
indo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on =
Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IM=

I'd like to go to the game, but I'm scheduled to be here on Sunday afternoon
to finish a project that goes live on Tuesday morning. I don't know if I
want to chance it with a deadline. I'd have to leave right after the game
and leave crowley early the next morning. Also, a shitload of construction
went up on i-10 this weekend b/w Lake Charles and Crowley. traffic would be
bad again. fuch it, it's on the deuce anyway.

   I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you
   and I
   didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first
   half
   to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
   stripper to go back to your place with you?

   Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
   8:00p.

   Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are
   staying
   here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

 RB SEA - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01According to the Tacoma Ne=
ws Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return=
 to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another mon=
th or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. =
"I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the l! in! eup. He=
 was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and pl=
ayed well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."=
 If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs o=
n your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexan=
der down the stretch. Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dil=
fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the=
 starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy roster=
s at this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Hassel=
beck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against M=
iami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer=

e, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Update=

dated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is s=
till expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this=
 week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01Chiefs =
Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris =
Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use =
either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi=

g to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was=
 originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, =
but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI=
 - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/23/01Staley started Monday's game against th=
e N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three =
times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buck=
halter, who gained 34 yards on! 1! 1 carries late in the game. At this poin=
t, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so co=

dated 10/23/01Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI o=
n his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. Fred Taylo=
r, RB! J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out o=
f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai=
ns uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe=
rcises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T=
imes-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=
 is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=
 of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inac=
tive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt, WR C=

owever, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson, WR TEN -=
 Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is e=
xpected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to pa=
rticipate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George=
 suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this w=
eek's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suf=
fering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, h=
e is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc prob=
lem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this =
week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't ex=
pect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his abs=
ence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expecte=
d to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his=
 injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated =
10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and h=
is status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from=
 week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head c=
oach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when=
 Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well t=
his week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return da=
te] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin =
on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nor=
thcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play w=
hen the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick to=
ld The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this wee=
k's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprai=
ned ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left a=
fter the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable=
 for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen i=
s inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Bill=
ick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but t=
he quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in =
the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with=
 the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just =
have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unabl=
e to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim =
suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. =
However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New=
 Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to=
 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Mar=
shall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall t=
o be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent =
before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not=
, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement la=
st Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspecti=
ve again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes=
 spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to be=
ing completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a bl=
essing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day," Stokes to=
ld the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100=
 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, =
so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more r=
eliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard contin=
ues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup =
within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 y=
ards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgica=
lly-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free =
Agent Updated 10/23/! 0!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Phil=
adelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.=
   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach=
 Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "=
I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I wo=
uld not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100=
 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Ca=
nidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    A=
nthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Age! nt! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected =
to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. =
Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright fr=
om a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in p=
lace of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catc=
hing abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper=
 leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Terrell =
will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as=
 was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez Wh=
ite will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's =
third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin=
 will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feel=
s confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Da=
llas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore =
, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinn=
is, Moore may not play a regular season! g! ame this season. Moore, who has=
 been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re=
covery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ=
ic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace=
d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h=
e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi=
m." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go=
.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is proba=
ble with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Phila=
delphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to g=
et the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the startin=
g job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR -=
 Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday=
 that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He ha=
s progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "He=
re's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your leagu=
e, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina st=
arting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green s=
uffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The inju=
ry will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out =
of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during th=
e week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Johns=
on , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final m=
inutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain=
. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's gam=
e against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you pre=
pare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/=
22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against=
 Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in," Bu=
cs Head Coach Tony Dungy! t! old the St. Petersburg Times . "Warrick pulled=
 a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be c=
arrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be car=
eful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett=
 Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in th=
e final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers hav=
e a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. "It'll be OK=
," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "Thank goodness I have a week=
 to relax. I think that will help."  James Stewart , RB DET ! -! Hunter Upd=
ated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth qu=
arter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont W=
arren finished the game in his absence.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=

I think Denis is going to come over and cook at my crib before the game (or
before we go out to tailgate in the late afternoon). We can concelebrate
game day with Bourge's and Gooch's B'day (both this week). If anyone wants
to come over and eat, drink, and watch other good games on TV, please let
me know so that I can plan for it. Let 's say it will start at Noon, with
food to be ready around 1-2 o'clock, and beer to be ready all day. I figure
we can go to campus around 4-5pm......anyone interested?

ted 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks=
, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams du=
ring their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers agai=
nst the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain th=
e team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach B! il! l Beli=
chick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to =
your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell=
 (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday=
's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder=
 has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle T=
imes . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning=
 Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams=
 as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated=
 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB contro=
versy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quar=
terback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there =
is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will=
 get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enou=
ght to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing sho=
ulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, beca=
use Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in footba=
ll.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley t=
old the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury.=
 He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated =
11/20/01! Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He wa=
s expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice thi=
s week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks =
Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived=
 at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't=
 expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR K=
C - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practic=
e. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam=
e. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doub=
tful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to st=
art in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 =
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Re=
ggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to b=
e moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal =
Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB contro=
versy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray ri! gh! t now. ``That's kind of hy=
pothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're g=
oing to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith ,=
 WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smit=
h (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against th=
e Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," S=
hanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play=
. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think =
can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Ben=
jamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer=
 says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future.=
 "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll s=
ee."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who su=
ffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday =
against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fan=
tasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updat! ed! =

delphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't b=

the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 11/20/01 Green=
 (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength.=
 He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is f=
avorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Owens su=
ffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last w=
eekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, how=
ever, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianap=
olis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered=
 a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few d=
ays of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Was=
hington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key bloc=
ker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Upd! at! ed 11/20/01 A=
ccording to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaire=
d right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, th=
e team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Cart=
er on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad =
wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest =
of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 The Balt=
imore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the te=
am's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most=
 Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver=
 is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's g=
ame against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy pla=
yer at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Defensiv=
e end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing kne=
e surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore d=
efense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.   =
 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, =
who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get =
the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep De=
nver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas'=
 defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Up=
dated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. "=
I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told the D=
allas Morning Star . He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Da=
llas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     D=
onald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ri=
bs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice ti=
me this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The F=
alcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn int=

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
"Overrated, Overrated".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called "Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al"
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   "Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   "The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   "LSU would whip UT"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   "UT is the most overrated team in college football" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   "Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was "tiger bait, tiger bait" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

 Trading Alerts  found on the left hand menu bar of our home page. For a Tr=
ack Record of former Trading Alerts, Click Here .      [IMAGE] Trading Aler=
t: Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PETP)   We were first asked to look at t=
his company over two months ago and were fascinated by the potential. You m=
ight not be familiar with the company, but unless you live in a vacuum you =
should be familiar with the issues surrounding their technology.   Petapeer=
 Holdings, Inc owns the commercial rights to market the Gnottella Network t=
echnology, which many see as the replacement for the highly publicized demi=
se of the on-line Napster Music Community.   You can visit http://gnotella.=
com  to learn more about P2P (Peer to Peer) file sharing for which Gnotella=
 provides technology.   The Gnotella network provides technology which allo=
ws simultaneous users to look directly into other user's computers, and tra=
nsfer files directly. Files are not limited to MP3 flies, as is the case wi=
th Napster. You can exchange anything from the most complex software to a r=
ecipe for fried chicken.   More importantly, management at Petapeer Holding=
s claims their technology does not infringe on copyright laws. Whereas Naps=
ter provides the ability to share files directly through Napster's server, =
Gnotella does not. Gnotella simply provides software which allows computers=
 to interface over the internet, and has no control over the exchange of fi=
les. Therefore, any violations would be the responsibility of the user, not=
 the software provider.   Today, after the market closed, Petapeer Holdings=
 issued a very significant press release which has the potential to push th=
is virtually unknown stock much higher.   Petapeer Holdings announced it ha=
s filed a Provisional Patent Application for a "new proprietary technology =
that will implement systems and methods for bolstering the Gnutella Network=
 while generating revenue for Petapeer".   We believe this stock has the po=
tential to become high profile when one considers all the press which surro=
unded the Napster demise. Furthermore, the company has come up with a revol=
utionary way to make money off the technology, and will be filing a patent =
on it.   The stock surged nicely two weeks ago, and has since retraced 50% =
of its previous gain, providing a low risk entry point.     [IMAGE] Trading=
 Alert Details [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PETP) trad=
ed as high as $1.70 on May 14th. Today the stock closed at $1.15.   Here ar=
e our thoughts on this Trading Alert on Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PET=
P):   As depicted in the chart, the nearest line of support is $1.06. The s=
tock has retraced about 50% of its gain the run made from late April to mid=
 May. Today's news after the close should create a great deal of interest a=
nd volume. Here is our recommendation:   *Buy up to $1.30 which gives you r=
oom to make money if the stock trades in our favor. *Set your Stop Loss at =
$1.06 ( Next Support Level as depicted in the chart) or what ever your risk=
 tolerance is. *If the stock can get through $1.75 in the next couple of da=
ys it should go higher it could find its way to nearly $2.  We view this st=
ock as highly risky, and this is not a long term recommendation. Don't be a=
fraid to take profits quickly if the market provides a gain, and don't be a=
fraid to sell quickly if the stock trades against you.   This newsletter is=
 our opinion only, and not a solicitation to buy this stock. Make up your o=
wn mind. If you are looking for a short term trade limit your loss if the s=
tock goes against you. As always, we remind you to review the section on ou=
r home page on Trading Alerts,  paying particular attention to the section =
on trading rules. The track record on our previous alerts can be obtained b=
y clicking here.    Here is the complete text of the news release for your =
review:     Petapeer Holdings Inc. Files Provisional Patent Application Wit=
h US Patent and Trademark Office for Revenue Model With US Patent and Trade=
mark Office for Revenue Model      NEW YORK, May 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Petapee=
r Holdings, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: PETP), announced today it has recentl=
y developed a new  proprietary technology that will implement systems and m=
ethods for bolstering the Gnutella Network while generating revenue for Pet=
apeer.  Petapeer has filed a provisional patent application covering the te=
chnology with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.        The new=
 technology covered by the application shall be used by Petapeer as a centr=
al part of its revenue model, and is intended to work with Petapeer's "Gnot=
ella" peer-to-peer file sharing software described below.  As the regular p=
atent application has not yet been filed and the technology and process not=
 yet disclosed, no further details can be revealed at the moment, except th=
at, like Gnotella, the new technology does not rely on advertiser-support o=
r "stealth" advertising components, known as "spyware" or "adware".  In acc=
ordance with United States patent practice, the invention now has an effect=
ive filing date that can be used in a later regular US patent application, =
provided that it is filed before the United States Patent and Trademark Off=
ice within 12 months of the provisional application.  This regular US paten=
t application is currently being drafted and is scheduled to be filed short=
ly.  Corresponding foreign patent applications may be filed under conventio=
nal priority within the same 12-month period, which the Company is consider=
ing.       Petapeer Holdings Inc.'s "Gnotella" peer-to-peer file sharing so=
ftware does not employ or support background or "stealth" advertising compo=
nents, known as "spyware" or "adware".  Spyware is sometimes employed to ge=
nerate revenue for providers of free software by installing itself into use=
rs'  computers and collecting personal information about those users, and t=
hen transmitting it to the providers of the spyware, sometimes without user=
s' knowledge or consent.   Recent reports have revealed that "spyware" and =
"adware" are contained in some software used to access the Gnutella Network=
. Petapeer's "Gnotella" software does not contain, nor has it ever containe=
d or employed "spyware" or "adware".       "We are pleased to be the very f=
irst to develop this technology, which will be available to our users if --=
 and only if -- they want to use it," said Stephane Chouinard, interim CEO =
of Petapeer Holdings Inc.  "The technology should provide us with an innova=
tive revenue model that promotes and strengthens the Gnutella Network witho=

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

Dear Bob,

I think you are doing all the fiji guys a great service by continuing to
promote this email talk center.  Keep up the good work.  I rarely have time
to converse with all of ya'll, but I do keep up with what's going on by
reading the emails ya'll send.  Would you do me a favor?

Please notify all that i use another email address now more often than this
one.  It is OUTLAWIN@bellsouth.net

Also, this past Saturday night I had my first baby.  It was a boy 7 lbs 10.4
ozs and 20.75" long.  I am very excited and his name is Jake.  Please pass
the word for me.

Thanks,

Outlaw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wonder how much the 'Stately Oak' grew during the past year? Oops! My bad!
I almost forgot that it was mysteriously cut down during an early '80's FIJI
Island pre-decorating/design phase. Has anyone ever fessed up to the
slaying? It sure did cause a terrible stir! If I remember correctly, the
cabinet considered canceling the Island unless the culprit confessed! This
may be a good topic of discussion? Maybe we could solve the mystery once and
for all?

And Bone, the arrest was a major event for at least three of us, me, Curt
and Tan Dan who came to court the next morning to bail us out! If that
arrest didn't make it, maybe the one when I got arrested for disturbing the
peace in Tiger Stadium during the '81 homecoming game against Fla. St. did?
At least the cops didn't beat me as bad as FSU beat the football team that
night! Or maybe Dan's 1st DWI made it? I'll let Dan tell that story.

Hope all you guys are doing well!

Brothers,   (Oct. 16)

Last night I received orders to report for duty this Thursday for up to 24
months.  As some of you may know, I command a Army Reserve unit in Dallas
TX.   I had just moved to Chicago two weeks ago to take a position within my
company, so this is inconvenient and with a very large pay cut, but I add, I
am very proud to be leading 90 of our finest soldiers into whatever mission
is delivered to us.  Due to operational Security(OPSEC), I can't talk much
about what I do, just keep me and my soldiers in your thoughts, and I will
join you at Pig Dinner 2003 or 2004.

Speaking of Brother Bonin, I'll recount a story during our Hellweek that all
can probably relate to.  Brother Bonin was the assistant Pledge Trainer for
our class in 77-78. Our Hellweek coincided with JamJam and, as slave labor,
we were unloading a truck of tables/chairs at a sorority house. One of the
sorority girls told Brother Bonin that the "pledges" could put the tables in
a certain spot. He corrected the girl by saying they aren't pledges.  When
the girl left, I asked Brother Bonin that if we aren't actives and we aren't
pledges, what are we?  Brother Bonin looked me in the eye and said, "You're
SCUM!"

Post Toasties, Man

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lots of news the past couple of weeks.  First, Godspeed to Brother Jeff
Farris.  I know we all wish him a very safe tour.  Second, congrats to the
"Outlaw" for his new baby boy.

Sounds like a lot of people will be in town for Ole Miss--Squid, Tan Dan
(The Worstells) and others.  Let me know who all is coming and maybe we can
all meet some place before or after the game.

Thanks to the 60 Brothers who have signed up for the Yahoo Group.  All the
past History that Brothers Slay & Bonin is helping us relive is posted
there.

hey there- how's it goin?

4th st. is sort-of away from all the college
crowd...it's pretty cool, i like it.  if you were to go
to 6th. 'the library' & 'the aquarium' are good
places. 'touche' is also pretty cool (flaming dr.pepper
gimick).
i work at 'lbjs broadcasting' there are six radio
stations in the building. i work specifically for
101X.  it is an alternative rock station.  i also make
some commercials; if you listen to the radio here-
that's me talking on the 'showpalace' & 'expose'
commercials.- yes- they are strip clubs.(no
affiliation) it also airs on 93.7fm.
how's it goin in the arm-pit of america?

Stephanie-

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it. 

Thank you, 

Matt Lenhart

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Thanks,

layer News   Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Cha=
mp Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's ex=
pected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missin=
g this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoo=
t if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moor=
e (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. =
He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him F=
antasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17=
/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t=
o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s=
tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Update=
d 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during S=
unday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play,=
 but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of t=
he week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all=
 possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed pr=
actice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seife=
rt expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If=
 you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terribl=
e Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Mat=
his (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Su=
nday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues fr=
om a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected =
to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too un=
reliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. =
He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his=
 swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in D=
allas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB =
DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the ye=
ar, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown fl=
ashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still mi=
nimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Be=
nnett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a ri=
ght ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentic=
e serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN =
- Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=
 against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to=
 start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unl=
ess it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He retu=
rns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.=
  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published =
reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. =
He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan w=
ants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this wee=
k, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any=
 Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mac=
k will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too produc=
tive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   K=
eenan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled =
in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in th=
e previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot =
of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins w=
ill have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of=
 passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC -=
 JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches =
and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yar=
ds and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady=
 is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is liste=
d as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only ha=
s five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01=
 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several =
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after t=
earing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disapp=
ointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mo=
rnhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a signi=
ficant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! L=
arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , R=
B OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley w=
ill miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was=
 beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie G=
arner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out=
 Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse"=
 back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to=
 four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/=
17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both kn=
ees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not a=
ffect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more =
involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are h=
ealthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the ye=
ar, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Patho=
n , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be=
 able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game a=
gainst Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot pla=
y again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Hera=
ld says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with st=
ress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smit=
h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Sta=
! , Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the com=
ing weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each oth=
er very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration=
 on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Al=
exander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed =
a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to t=
he injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Micha=
el Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concus=
sion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. H=
is status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but =
he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 C=
lark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on hi=
s right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Con=
tra Costa Times. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before =
the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I coul=
d do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head C=
oach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make =
his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game=
 against Chicago.    More Updates  Playe! r ! News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matty Pl=
ayer News  Michael Pittman , Active RB Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffer=
ed a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on=
 Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questio=
nable, but he is expected to play.   Giants , Active DT Updated 10/17/01 De=
fensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's=
 game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against=
 Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able=
 to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a s=
prained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this po=
int.   Michael Bennett , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as d=
oubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Ex=
pect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his bac=
kup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Marshall Faulk , Active RB Updated 10/16=
/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets=
 despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," c=
oach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playi=
ng completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will =
be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decis=
ion on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation=
 throughout the week.   Brian Griese , Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 The Bron=
cos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego,=
 according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right =
shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder =
surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunda=
y's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Brad John=
son , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Johnson finally had a productive game Fan=
tasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards and three scores against Tennessee. He is=
 still not worth starting on a regular basis, however, and is better off us=
ed when the matchup is good.   Terry Glenn , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Gle=
nn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven passes f=
or 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis=
, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receiv=
ers.   Rod Smith , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Smith's yardage numbers might=
 be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, p=
robable) is close to top form. But he should still catch at least one TD pa=
ss as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with the lack of a solid pass rush.=
  Frank Wycheck , Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 Look for Wycheck to catch a l=
ot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of looks because he has been us=
ed mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie George. But George is suffering=
 from an ankle injury and isn't expected to get a lot of carries. The Titan=
s will throw to Wycheck to compensate.   Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 10/12=
/01 Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secon=
dary is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in t=
he past.   Oronde Gadsden , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Gadsden should find=
 himself in position to catch a TD pass against the Jets. Miami will score =
often against the New York defense.  Sebastian Janikowski , Active K Update=
d 10/10/01 Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that w=
as suffered during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and sh=
ould play against the Colts this week.  J.J. Stokes , Reserve WR Updated 10=
/09/01 Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is l=
isted as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsis=
tent thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise.   Aaro=
n Brooks , Active QB Updated 10/08/01 Brooks turned in his second consecuti=
ve mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interce=
ption and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games b=
ut the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning gam=
es. He's worth a starting spot Fantasy-wise this week against Carolina.   [=

Please forward to Suzanne as well.  Will you review this spreadsheet for April penalties associated with Texaco?  The volumes and prices did not look correct to me.  Let me know and I will have Anne change the value.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the possible penalties we will be charging on the six PG&E Topock April Baseload load purchases that were severely cut throughout the month.  If we use the Gas Daily High Price plus $0.15, then the total penalties will be $2,032,902, but if we use the methodology described in the contract (Gas Daily), the total penalties will be $889,377.

I spoke to Phillip while you were out to see which method we should use. He said to wait until you returned.  I also verified with Darron that from a settlements perspective, we can send penalty invoices at any time.  Let's discuss when you return.  I have copies of all of the pertinent information.

Thanks

Anne

tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0=
1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w=
as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=
 this year and has become a major sco! ri! ng threat even though he is not =
very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWilli=
e Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards recei=
ving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most par=
t, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to b=
ench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw fo=
r 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been i=
nconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod eve=
ry week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rus=
hed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not gr=
eat, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapma=
n may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healt=
hy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/=
21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions f=
or 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the=
 league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Michael Pittman , RB A=
RI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Ka=
nsas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won'=
t post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable pla=
yer to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
1/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for=
 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to=
 start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDain=
ian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in che=
ck for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback =
rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy =
players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/=
01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a s=
core against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a F=
antasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Gri=
ese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sun! da! y'=
s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passi=
ng, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warri=
ck , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 y=
ards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his =
owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CI=
N - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 car=
ries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performanc=
e very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terre=
ll caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinso=
n injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passi=
ng game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed f=
or 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as C=
hicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of =
the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught s=
even passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit! . ! Despite some quiet outin=
gs until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the =
Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free =
Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was interce=
pted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two =
consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of =
inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair thre=
w for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed on=
ly 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indi=
cating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George , RB=
 TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by D=
etroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hind=
ered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against th=
e Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't =
expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD again=
st New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the re=
mainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 =
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definite=
ly time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - =
Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on fi=
ve catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality At=
lanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa! ble of providing owners with =
regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 Ward w=
as limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making =
important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited be=
cause of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick =
Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury th=
at had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 c=
arries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five c=
atches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, how=
ever, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a =
position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He =
has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The vetera=
n wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis. =
 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 ya=
rds and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pa=
ss. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defe=
nse.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a hug=

Why I fired my secretary.....
Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that
morning anyway.  I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant
and say "Happy Birthday," and probably have a present for me. She didn't
even say "Good Morning," let alone any "Happy Birthday." I thought, "Well,
that's wives for you, the children will remember."  The children came in
to  breakfast and didn't say a word. When I started to the office I was
feeling pretty low and despondent.  As I walked into my office, my secretary,
Janet, said, "Good morning, boss. Happy Birthday.! ! "  And I felt a
little better; someone had remembered. I worked until noon.  Then, Janet
knocked on my door and said, "You know, it's such a beautiful day outside and
it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me." I said, "By
George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go." We went to
lunch. We didn't go where we normally go; we went out to the country to a
little private place.  We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.
On the way back to the office, she said, "You know, it's such a beautiful
day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we?" I said, "No, I guess
not."  She said, "Let's go to my apartment." After arriving at her apartment she
said, "Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into
something more comfortable." "Sure," I excitedly replied. She went into
the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a big
birthday cake, followed by my wife, children, and dozens of our friends,all
singing Happy Birthday.
And there I sat...on the couch...naked.

no, that's wrong.  you just kept saying one rude thing after another which
bothered me.  it doesn't matter.  the point is that it should not be so
difficult for you to not be rude.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

 IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first t=
ime he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, b=
ut should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR M=
IN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesd=
ay due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday a=
nd play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use h=
im until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR G=
B - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankl=
e injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his=
 progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR N=
E - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. In=
dianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately pr=
oved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB=
 NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi=
rst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=
 least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre=
bet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very di=
sappointing so far. He could have a good week i! f ! the Jets engage in a s=
hootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cen=
ter its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - JWilli=
e Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but =
might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able=
 to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18=
/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The J=
ets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   ! Stephe=
n Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent ga=
me of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fant=
asy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an adva=
ntageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considerati=
on.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very medi=
ocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 13=
2 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster s=
pot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Up=
d! at! ed 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but h=
e could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success agains=
t the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper le=
agues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde=
 might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportun=
istic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of=
 the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will =
likely get most of the work at tight en! d ! now that Stephen Alexander is =
out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Ro=
d Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decen=
t game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth cons=
idering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt=
 , WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big number=
s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi=
deout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruc=
e , WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus =
far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to t=
urn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Con=
well , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tig=
ht end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a week=
ly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trun=
g Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wil! l ! likely rep=
lace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.=
Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth s=
tarting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hunt=
er Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent=
 basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game ag=
ainst the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Cor=
rell Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't exp=
ected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carri=
es on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Stal=
ey in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive! o! =
f the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNab=
b is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on=

kim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Je=
ts. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against=
 New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Accor=
ding to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place=
 of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Mar=
shall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 p=
ercent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if h=
e's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replace=
ment last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy pe=
rspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/=
23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is=
 close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early.=
 It was a blessing for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day=
," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't=
 say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocr=
e, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself =
to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/2=
3/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants=

Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repa=

 Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike =
Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm ju=
st taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would no=
t expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 perce=
nt before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate=
 would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    Anthony=
 Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent ! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to star=
t Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Le=
af could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fa=
ntasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Update=
d 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of=
 the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching ab=
ilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper league=
s.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Terrel! l ! will =
not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was =
reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White w=
ill start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third=
 receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin will=
 have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels con=
fident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas,=
 so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore , WR =
ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinni=
s, Moore may not play a regular season gam! e ! this season. Moore, who has=
 been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re=
covery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ=
ic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace=
d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h=
e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi=
m." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go=
.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probabl=
e with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philade=
lphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get=
 the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting =
job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday t=
hat Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He has =
progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here=
's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league,=
 as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina star=
ting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 10/22/01 Green=
 suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The in=
jury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him ou=
t of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during =
the week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Joh=
nson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the fina=
l minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor str=
ain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's =
game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you =
prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively =
Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's g=
ame against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to=
 be in," Bucs Head Coach Tony Dung! y ! told the St. Petersburg Times . "Wa=
rrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know wh=
o it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injure=
d, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week S=
even.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and Sports=

I don't think the Avs are done. They looked shitty last night, as soon as
the Devils got that 2nd goal they played the trap defense. The Avs could
barely handle the puck all night. If they were at the top of their game they
could have scored at least one more goal against that defense. We'll see.

Are any of you interested in doing New Year's Eve at Chateau this year?
For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, the country
club my parents belong to throws a big new years party every year.  The
price ranges from $200.00-$250.00 per couple and includes the following:
buffet style dinner, OPEN BAR, four different bands, champagne at
midnight, buffet style breakfast and party favors.  Each year, there is
a theme by which the place is decorated (they always do a good job on
this).  It is black tie optional or nice dark suit in the alternative.
THE CATCH TO ALL OF THIS IS MONEY IS DUE THIS WEDNESDAY FOR EARLY
RESERVATIONS...AFTER THIS WEDNESDAY, IT IS A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE
BASIS AND YOU ARE SEATED UPON AVAILABILITY.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN...IF
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, GIVE ME A CALL AT 584-9416 or Timmy at 585-7769.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/26/01 Brookins is expected to miss the rest =
of the season with a broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimo=
re's No. 1 RB now, and the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the=
 next few days.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/26/01 Bar=
low dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not b=
een determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/0=
1 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is d=
ay to day.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/01 Jackson=
 re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day=
.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The Executioners Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is li=
sted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken=
 for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's W=
eek 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 8=
0 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in=
 recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opp=
onents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kil=
l Cult Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three c=
atches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail rema=
ins a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complet=
e and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So Ni=
ce Machine Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jac=
ksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too errat=
ic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - N=
ot So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball ! si! x times fo=
r 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the=
 remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Executioners Updated =
11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught f=
ive passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners w=
ould still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tom=
linson , RB SD - The Executioners Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o=
f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook=
ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'=
s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Flu=
tie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Ari=
zona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantag=
e.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/25/01 Plummer =
had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against! S=
! an Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy qu=
arterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25=
/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards =
and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy re=
ceivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Ja=
ckson , WR NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing=
 against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. H=
e may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting=
 in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 11/25/01 Hor=
n had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New E=
ngland. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth s=
tarting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated=
 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball fi! v=
e! times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage p=
ackages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy t=
eam in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able t=
o take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - The=
 Guzzlers Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two tou=
chdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty =
good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - The Executi=
oners Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posti=
ng 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fan=
tasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patri=
ots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Executioners Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions agai=
nst the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look li=
ke the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Nort=
h Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 Sanders l! ef! t Sunday's game against =
San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTa=
y Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Who's Yo=
 Daddy Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catc=
hing six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fum=
ble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disapp=
ointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best ou=
ting of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 y=
ards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantas=
y consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde=
 Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight =
passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lo=
st a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in t=
hese important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/=
25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards! , ! three TDs and no interceptions at Bu=
ffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedl=
er is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb=
 , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNab=
b to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. E=
xpect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.=
  James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught f=
our passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a =
starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , W=
R WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for=
 only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the pa=
st few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   M=

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilita! te! =
with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work to=
ward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - =
Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game w=
ith the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.=
 Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is e=
xpected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a =
risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Upda=
ted 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against=
 Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individ=
ual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play de=
spite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a resul=
t.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Smit! h ! will return to=
 the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a spra=
ined right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice=
 that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return b=
umps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either ba=
ck against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja U=
pdated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on F=
riday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. =
 However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league t=
his week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth =
considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free A=
gent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the st=
arting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's n=
ot worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunte=
r Shively Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season =
despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's on=
e of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and =
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN=
 - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this=
 season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has=
 a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rook=
ie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , =
WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Mon=
day's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been undera=
chieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his =
potential to post solid Fantasy num! be! rs.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the=
 league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an India=
napolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams i=
s a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Broo=
ks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yard=
s and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potenti=
al to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a v=
ulne! ra! ble Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last week=
end, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable =
Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting J=
ackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart=
 Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season =
slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is on=
ce again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week =
10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Ton=
y Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of l=
ate, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matc=
hup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, =
but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Wes=
tbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsiste=
nt this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four g=
ames. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best=
, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , W=
R WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his l=
ast two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favo=
rable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a go=
od move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has be=
en inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a =
gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England=
 secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Tor=
ry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consisten=
t yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. H=
e'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth =
starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid number=
s.   Isaac Br! uc!  , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't p=
ut up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better=
 wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New Englan=
d secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big n=
umbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a=
 huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy play=
er in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbe=
rs in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie! C! onwell  , TE STL - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on you=
r Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end=
 around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy own=
ers will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against Sa=
n Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. =
Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , =
WR ! CA! R - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 y=
ards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owner=
s this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR -=
 Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the las=
t three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. H=
e's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is =
advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad fina=
lly had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards agains=
t St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent=
, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - =
The Klap Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbac=
ks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a v=

 numbers,! b! ut his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable F=

 injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a =

                                           simple)





 MAKE A WISH BEFORE BEGINNING THE TEST!!

A Warning!      Answer the questions as you go along..
      There are only four questions and if you see them all before
finishing

- you will not have honest results. Go down slowly and do each exercise as
you scroll down. Don't look ahead. Get pencil and paper to write your
answers
as you go along. You will need it at the end. This is an honest
questionnaire, which will tell you a lot about your true self..



Put the following 5 animals in the order of your preference.
       a. Cow
        b. Tiger
        c. Sheep
        d. Horse
        e. Pig






Write one word that describes each one of the following:
       Dog
       Cat
       Rat
       Coffee
       Sea



        Think of someone (who also knows you and is important to you) that
you can
relate them to the following colors. (Please do not repeat your answer
twice.
 Name just one person for each color.)
        Yellow
        Orange
        Red
        White
        Green







        Finally,write down your favorite number and your favorite day of
the

week.








       Finished? Please be sure that your answers are what you REALLY WANT.










        Look at the interpretations below: (but first before continuing,
repeat your wish.)






        This will define your priorities in your life.

        Cow signifies CAREER
        Tiger Signifies PRIDE
        Sheep Signifies LOVE
        Horse Signifies FAMILY
       Pig Signifies MONEY

      Your description of dog implies YOUR OWN PERSONALITY.
      Your description of cat implies the personality of your partner.
      Your description of rat implies the personality of your enemies.
      Your description of coffee is how you interpret SEX.
      Your description of the Sea implies your own life.


        Yellow:  Someone you will never forget
        Orange: Someone you consider your true friend.
        Red:      Someone that you really love
        White:   Your twin soul
        Green:   Someone that you will remember for the rest of your life.


      You have to send this message to as many persons as your favorite
number and your wish will come true on the day that you put. This is what
the
Dalai Lama has said about the Millennium -- just take a few seconds to read
it and think. Do not put away this message, the mantra will come out from
your hands in the next 96 hours. You will have a very pleasant surprise.
This
is true, even if you are not superstitious.



       Please do this. It is fascinating.


        SEND THIS E-MAIL MANTRA TO AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS AND YOUR LIFE WILL
IMPROVE

        0-4 persons: Your life will improve slightly.
      5-9 persons: Your life will improve to your liking.
      9-14 persons: You will have at least 5 surprises in the next three
weeks.
       15 or more persons: Your life will improve drastically and all that
you have always dreamed will take shape.

      If at any time you do not receive the smile you were expecting, be
generous and give that person a smile. Because nobody has as much necessity
of a smile than the person that does not know how to smile at others.

OK Zuc - you had to drag up one of indiscretions that landed us in jail, now you have to bring up our altercation in Tiger Stadium that got us thrown out?  If I remember correctly, we seemed not to be good influences on each other.  My fondest memory of our jailtime was the guy who stood above us as we slept on the floor and he was peeing and farting for about 10 minutes straight - or maybe it was the guy the next morning to whom you were handcuffed as we were led into court who decided he needed to get himself off while we were waiting in the holding cell.  I don't know why you were so wigged out about it.  At least he didn't throw up on you in court.  
 
I thought I escaped my sordid other life..........

I wonder how much the 'Stately Oak' grew during the past year? Oops! My bad!
I almost forgot that it was mysteriously cut down during an early '80's FIJI
Island pre-decorating/design phase. Has anyone ever fessed up to the
slaying? It sure did cause a terrible stir! If I remember correctly, the
cabinet considered canceling the Island unless the culprit confessed! This
may be a good topic of discussion? Maybe we could solve the mystery once and
for all?
And Bone, the arrest was a major event for at least three of us, me, Curt
and Tan Dan who came to court the next morning to bail us out! If that
arrest didn't make it, maybe the one when I got arrested for disturbing the
peace in Tiger Stadium during the '81 homecoming game against Fla. St. did?
At least the cops didn't beat me as bad as FSU beat the football team that
night! Or maybe Dan's 1st DWI made it? I'll let Dan tell that story.
Hope all you guys are doing well!

Brothers,   (Oct. 16)
Last night I received orders to report for duty this Thursday for up to 24
months.  As some of you may know, I command a Army Reserve unit in Dallas
TX.   I had just moved to Chicago two weeks ago to take a position within my
company, so this is inconvenient and with a very large pay cut, but I add, I
am very proud to be leading 90 of our finest soldiers into whatever mission
is delivered to us.  Due to operational Security(OPSEC), I can't talk much
about what I do, just keep me and my soldiers in your thoughts, and I will
join you at Pig Dinner 2003 or 2004.

wow....Jeff you are the Man

Speaking of Brother Bonin, I'll recount a story during our Hellweek that all
can probably relate to.  Brother Bonin was the assistant Pledge Trainer for
our class in 77-78. Our Hellweek coincided with JamJam and, as slave labor,
we were unloading a truck of tables/chairs at a sorority house. One of the
sorority girls told Brother Bonin that the "pledges" could put the tables in
a certain spot. He corrected the girl by saying they aren't pledges.  When
the girl left, I asked Brother Bonin that if we aren't actives and we aren't
pledges, what are we?  Brother Bonin looked me in the eye and said, "You're
SCUM!"
Post Toasties, Man

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lots of news the past couple of weeks.  First, Godspeed to Brother Jeff
Farris.  I know we all wish him a very safe tour.  Second, congrats to the
"Outlaw" for his new baby boy.
Sounds like a lot of people will be in town for Ole Miss--Squid, Tan Dan
(The Worstells) and others.  Let me know who all is coming and maybe we can
all meet some place before or after the game.
Thanks to the 60 Brothers who have signed up for the Yahoo Group.  All the
past History that Brothers Slay & Bonin is helping us relive is posted
there.

america.  i know, i've lived there all my life.  you

beautiful clean place like austin. but i'm glad to know
that there are people who still love houston too.

Natural Gas Futures and Cash Continue Lower
Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower after the AGA announced natu=
ral gas inventories jumped 117 Bcf last week, well above market expectation=
s. The July contract fell $0.091 to $3.801 per MMBtu and August dipped $0.0=
87 to $3.888 per MMBtu. The AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtu=
ally identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. Last=
 years injection was 78 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 81 Bcf for =
the comparable weeks. The large build was driven by a lack of demand on Mem=
orial Day and mild weather. Warmer weather is expected to affect much of th=
e nation over the next several days, limiting the upside reaction. The hot =
weather in the southwestern states will begin to expand into Texas and the =
central Plains this weekend extending into the Southeast next week. Look fo=
r the market to continue lower today under the weight of the 117 Bcf inject=
ion. But, with the summer heat and the hurricanes beginning to show up, it =
is becoming increasingly dangerous to short the market. The next key level =
of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.15 $0.25 per MMBtu=
, except out west where prices tumbled over $1.00. Canadian spot prices tum=
bled about $0.50 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry =
hub lost $0.23 to $3.76 per MMBtu.

BPA Power Contract Rates Up
The BPA says wholesale power rates will be offered at a 150% or greater pre=
mium in October, and that it has achieved 51% of its goal to lower demand f=
or its power. For aluminum producers, that means they would have to pay abo=
ut $50 per MWh for BPA power once their new five-year contract takes effect=
 on October 1st. That is a substantial increase over the $24 per MWh smelte=
rs in the Pacific Northwest were used to paying under their expiring five-y=
ear contracts, but much less than the 250% to 300% increase BPA anticipated=
 last April. The BPA has been negotiating with industrial customers to redu=
ce their power demand. In return, BPA agrees to pay their employees' wages.=
 Most aluminum smelters in the Northwest have already curtailed or stopped =
operating to comply with BPA's request. Customers have until June 22nd to c=
omplete their negotiations for power contracts. On June 29th, BPA will subm=
it power rates to the FERC.

New Coal Fired Power Plants Making Comeback
New coal-fired power plants are now being planned after a decade in which a=
lmost none were built in the US. But, now 34 coal plants are being planned =
to meet ever increasing power needs across the nation. Energy Secretary Abr=
aham has called for 1,300 new power plants over the next 20 years to meet p=
rojected demand. Electricity demand has more than doubled over the last 20 =
years. Coal currently fires more than half of US electricity production. Th=
e expansion of coal power plants has been put off pollution concerns. Clean=
er burning natural gas produces only 15% of the nation's power, but increas=
ing quickly. Natural gas emits 43% less carbon dioxide than conventional co=
al burning. As a result, 90% of planned power plants are natural gas fired.=
 But, now scrubbers that cut up to 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions and grow=
ing amounts of nitrogen oxide. Peabody Group, the largest coal company in t=
he world, is planning a $1.5 billion 1,500 MW Thoroughbred plant slated to =
come online in 2005 in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. That plant, which Peabo=
dy plans to make an environmental showcase, will be built beside a coal min=
e. Illinois plans to build three coal-fired plants. Last week the state leg=
islature approved a $3.5 billion package of tax incentives and low-cost loa=
ns for the construction of new power plants that can burn high sulfur coal =
from Illinois.

California Power Bill Dead
House Republicans have declared dead a proposed bill to help California avo=
id summer power outages, after Democrats refused to drop demands for wholes=
ale price caps opposed by President Bush. But as power shifts from Republic=
ans to Democrats in the Senate, there is a continued battle over price cont=
rols. The FERC, which has authority to cap prices, also opposes them. Repub=
licans, without more support, simply ran out of time to help California, wh=
ich faces many hours of blackouts this summer. The proposed legislation wou=
ld have also waived some clean air regulations to allow power plants to ope=
rate during peak times, relieved transmission congestion with new lines and=
 forced the federal government to cut energy use in its California offices =
20%. The bill-writing session collapsed after California Rep. Waxman sought=
 an amendment to stop what he called price-gouging by wholesale power selle=

Study Says More Natural Gas Drilling Restricted
More of the recoverable natural gas in the Rocky Mountains is off-limits to=
 drilling than previously thought, according to a new DOE study. A review f=
ound that about 68% of the recoverable supplies in the Greater Green River =
Basin in southern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado, up to 79 Tcf, is eithe=
r closed to drilling or under significant access restrictions. The conclusi=
ons are much higher than a similar 1999 study which said 40% was off limits=
. The US consumes about 23 Tcf of natural gas per year. The studied area co=
vered almost 29 million acres of land with almost 160 Tcf of gas, of which =
16 million acres with 117 Tcf was under federal ownership. Slightly over tw=
o-thirds of the recoverable federal natural gas in the study was either clo=
sed to development or available with restrictions.

PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy
A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a state-sponsored $2=
.76 billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility=
 into bankruptcy. The PUC will meet today, but had not put on its agenda th=
e regulatory changes which were agreed upon last April by the utility and t=
he governor. If the PUC doesn't implement the changes by Friday, the state =
or the utility could back out of the plan. The political reality is that Ed=
ison is likely going to slouch toward Chapter 11. The legislature has 120 d=
ays to approve the plan which has been faulted as too generous to SCE and o=
f little use to consumers and creditors, while throwing California into the=
 power generation business. SCE has a long line of creditors awaiting back =
payments, including at least 30 power generators that have sued it. It only=
 takes three to throw the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. Some analyst=
s think that risk is already very high.

Wednesday June 6 2001
Nye thinks Bush may
lead US to retail
power competition
-
But when will Texas
link with North
American grid?
First of several articles
Erle Nye, TXU CEO, has taken over the reins at EEI from John Rowe, the Exel=
on co-CEO.  The two spoke to the press at EEI's annual meeting in New Orlea=
ns yesterday.
They had briefed the vice president when he was putting together the White =
House's new energy policy.=20
Does Nye think Bush will lead a national switch from monopoly to competitio=
n in electricity as he did in Texas.
Bush believes in it and led the move to open up Texas, Nye said, and when t=
he time is right, he expects the president to take the leadership to open u=
p retail markets.=20
Nye speaks for the investor owned electric industry but as a Texas grid own=
er at TXU he knows a lot about ERCOT.
We asked him when Texas (ERCOT) will hook up to the North American grid.  =
=09It's already connected for up to 600 mw, Nye replied, but it's a DC tie =
and the power is easy to control.=20
His short answer was that ERCOT will build more ties to the east and west w=
hen it's worth doing.  It won't happen until there's a strong financial dri=
ver.  The grid grew up around load, he reminded, and between the huge easte=
rn and western interties exists a large nothingness where load is small or =
non-existent.
If a need arises for another connection between ERCOT and SPP he knows exac=
tly how much it will cost for another DC line because they've done that.
If someone has to build six 345 or higher kv lines at major interconnection=
 points, then Nye has to ask what the investor gets in return.=20
The president talks of it like the Interstate Highway system, Nye noted wit=
h some skepticism.
Is not Nye's view based on fear of FERC jurisdiction?=20
"We're all going to be subject to FERC anyway," Nye asserted.=20
"If you want to make it subject to FERC, pass a law," Nye advised.=20
Will FERC favor the connection, he asked rhetorically.
Nye predicts FERC would look at a connection proposal "under today's circum=
stances" and determine that a lump of investment that large can be better s=
pent somewhere else.=20
At the bottom line on the question of connecting the East and West there ha=
s to be a way to make some money, Nye reminded.  And any time would be DC, =
he assumes, since AC power flow is too hard to control.=20
"The idea of a national grid is premature," he predicted, but it will happe=
n when the economics justify it.
"... when the rate of return justifies it."
We asked Nye what is a good rate of return in today's world.
For transmission, what is a return that would motivate investment in the gr=
id?
"North of 11.5-12% to do what's important and it would need to be more in a=
 more challenging environment.=20
"If it's real easy to do and anybody can do it, you can get by with the low=
er return," Nye added.=20
Williams' CEO Keith Bailey asks why he should invest for a small return whe=
n he can get 20+% in broadband, we noted.=20
Nye noted that broadband has more risk too.=20
Nye respects departing EEI chairman John Rowe and intends little change in =
management style at EEI.  He shares Rowe's positive view of where the indus=
try is headed and should go, he said.  Rowe is more competition minded than=
 earlier EEI top leaders and Nye is even more pro-competition than Rowe.
Nye believes in the Texas retail power competition bill and is keyed up to =
do well when the market really opens for all Jan 1.  Nye tells us he'll be =
active on behalf of EEI members and will be "accessible."
He expects "to lead the industry in those areas where we are collectively t=
ogether and hopefully compromise on those areas where we may have some diff=
erent views."=20
EEI has come a long way over the decade or so that we've been writing about=
 it.=20
How does Nye perceive that difference?
He finds Tom Kuhn and staff sensitive to changes in the industry and in the=
 views of members, Nye replied.
"The industry is obviously going through a remarkable transition ... and ge=
nerally speaking it's all positive, positive for the nation, for the consum=
ers and for our shareholders," Nye observed of the growing competition.
EEI has been "very progressive in moving staff into the areas that are more=
 important and in reducing efforts in those areas that are less important, =
less valuable to the membership and being responsive, he added.
Nye has seen large members drop out of EEI - especially in California where=
 some members have said:
"We've sold the generation and are not doing marketing, so EEI isn't quite =
the organization for us."
The association has set up a dues structure to lure transmission only and g=
eneration only companies.=20
Does Nye see the investor-owned electric utilities breaking up over the yea=
rs to come?
He expects various firms to take different paths --  with "some disaggregat=
ion of the traditional integrated form."
Nye knows EEI members represent a spectrum of views but views can be consis=
tent if not identical.=20
EEI members have always had differences based on differing business plans a=
nd asset configurations.
But the industry has "an absolute need for an industry association to repre=
sent those critical views.
"At the end of the day we all recognize that we have much in common and the=
refore we need to speak collectively and with one voice," Nye added.
Tauzin's attempt at
Calif price cap
compromise fails
---
Barton drops action
on Calif help bill
House Energy & Commerce Committee, Billy Tauzin, R-La, was to bring his hig=
hly divided committee back together this morning to win support for HR 1647=
, the Electricity Emergency Relief Act to help California.=20
The measure has been blocked by partisan differences on wholesale price con=
trols.  Thus, Tauzin canceled the meeting before it started.
A bit later Joe Barton, R-Tex, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy & Air=
 Quality, announced a switch in strategy, dropping the subcommittee-adopted=
 measure.=20
The Democrats assumption of power in the Senate may have been a key factor =
in his decision since Chairman Jeff Bingagman, D-NM, could prevent action o=
n the bill Barton had gotten through his subcommittee.=20
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has been chilly to the bill without price =
controls.  Some provisions have been adopted by the feds and the California=
 government, Barton added, citing fixing Path 15, boosting financial help f=
or the poor and better treatment of QFs.=20
Barton opined that by the time he could get a compromise adopted it would b=
e too late for any benefit this summer.=20
His strategy now is to focus on the longterm provisions in the Bush nationa=
l energy policy.
Bingaman, the new Democratic chairman of the Energy & Natural Resources Com=
mittee, intends to block the Bush energy and environment program and start =
afresh.=20
Bingaman is hotly in favor of wholesale energy price caps in California and=
 is co-sponsor of a bill to impose them.
But he cautions that he'd rather see FERC put them in place.  Bingaman is c=
autious about Bush's interest in easing regulations on power plants.
He has introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming.
The 57-year-old Senator says he's going to try to sit with Republicans and =
work out some middle ground.=20
He's already reportedly made some progress on renewables, wind power and en=
ergy production tax credits.
Can we double energy
efficiency by 2010?
The Assn of Energy Engineers (AEE) favors a comprehensive energy technology=
 strategy and the one they want could double the energy efficiency of build=
ings by 2010, slash carbon emissions in half, and save $100 billion a year,=
 said Albert Thumann, the group's executive director.
You can see their energy policy at www.aeecenter.org.
AEE asked its 8,000 members whether the administration's national energy po=
licy would encourage new supply and 98% said it should.
Then 69% said environmental regulations shouldn't be eased to build new pla=
nts, though.
While 75% of the non-profit's members felt nuclear power should be encourag=
ed, the report criticized the Bush plan for not promoting conservation and =
energy efficiency.
The White House energy plan cuts R&D funding for energy efficiency technolo=
gies by $160 million and relies heavily on oil and gas exploration and buil=
ding new power generation stations at the expense of the environment, AEE s=
aid.
Tauzin pictures
wide-spread
blackouts
Rep Billy Tauzin, chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee dramatically =
warned EEI of a looming energy crisis larger than almost anyone's envisione=
d so far.
The entire US may be in for California-scale blackouts if natural gas produ=
ction isn't increased and new electric plants aren't built fast.
The country is "very close" to the beginning of a national energy crisis th=
at endangers, among other things, the nation's high-tech infrastructure.
He echoed dire warnings sounded earlier by the administration, saying that =
the country needs "1,300 to 1,900" new power plants just to stay even with =
a projected 45% rise in electric demand over the next two decades.
Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said she's bullish on continued e=
nergy deregulation in the states, despite California's woes.
She called for new investment in renewable energy.  An advocate of nuclear =
power, she expressed disappointment of incoming Democratic Senate leaders w=
ho oppose the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository.
Use DG as risk
management tool?
XENERGY sees distributed generation as a growing risk management tool, a sa=
fety net to protect against wholesale price spikes, rolling blackouts and i=
ntermittent power quality issues.  They really studied DG to the point wher=
e they're selling the study for $10,000.=20
It's Distributed Power Technology Markets 2000.  It lists barriers to the n=
ew technology such as inability of some customers to get into load manageme=
nt programs, lack of understanding of load management benefits, lack of nee=
ded metering.
With it comes a database of 100 companies with interests in DG and load man=
agement, including utilities, manufacturers, technology companies and other=
s.  Contact is Francis Cummings at 781-273-5700.
PG&E gets time to
negotiate deals
with QF creditors
Judge Dennis Montali has granted Calpine's request to postpone until July 5=
 a hearing to decide whether the state's largest QF generator can be releas=
ed from its contract with Pacific Gas & Electric so it can sell at market p=
rices.=20
PG&E has three weeks to negotiate QF contracts before the federal bankruptc=
y judge decides whether to let small generators out of their long-term cont=
racts at prices that once were above market but now are below.
Bankruptcy law provides for the bankrupt to review its contracts and persua=
de the judge to let it do what it would like to do with each.
PG&E has thousands of contracts.  If the utility keeps the contract, it fac=
es paying the QF a court approved amount going forward and a settlement on =
past debts.=20
The total owed may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Montali deni=
ed a QF creditor's committee motion for an immediate decision.
Avoiding cascading
failure at TVA
If the security grid coordinators around the country can't share informatio=
n about what's happening on the transmission networks, congestion problems =
will worsen, predicted Vikram Budhraja, CEO of Electric Power Group.
One of the most seriously congested pathway in America last summer was disc=
overed running north to south through TVA.
Over 1,000 transactions were cancelled from May to September last year and =
even more are expected this year.
If that load isn't controlled, Budhraja warned the eastern interconnection =
is vulnerable to a cascading network failure.=20
Budhraja chairs CERTS (Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solut=
ions) and the group has just put the finishing touches on software that can=
 track congestion on the TVA path and NERC will be installing it within the=
 next few days.
The 1996 WSCC outage could have been prevented if information had been trad=
ed between control areas better, he said.=20
Murkowski vows to
fight electricity
price caps policy
It was Frank Murkowski's last day as chairman -- for now -- of the Energy &=
 Natural Resources Committee.
His final message as the chairman yesterday was that the minority Republica=
ns will not supports caps for electricity prices in California.
The Alaska Republican may now seem to fade into the background but for all =
we know, control of the Senate may bounce back and forth as members come an=
d go during this session of Congress.=20
Republicans, vowed Murkowski, will fight any effort to include price contro=
ls in the comprehensive energy policy engendered by the president and now b=
eing hashed out in committee.=20
Sen Jeff Bingaman, D-NM, the incoming chairman, will allow dozens of new am=
endments to come before the committee, prompting Murkowski to call the Demo=
crats approach to an energy policy "piecemeal."=20
Democrats don't plan to boost production.
For Murkowski that's a mistake made in the 1992 Energy Policy Act and an er=
ror in judgement about to be repeated, Murkowski argued.=20
The elements pushing production were stricken from the 1992 law but mandati=
ng low flush toilets did get included, the senator reminded.=20
Bush's energy plan had "a lack of balance'' with not enough emphasis promot=
ing conservation, energy efficiency and development of renewable wind, sola=
r and geothermal energy sources, Democrats charged Monday.
The majority members don't want to deal with the nuclear waste issue and th=
at kills any hope to spur new nuclear plant construction, Murkowski groused=
.
Setting the tone for the new committee makeup, the ex-chairman passionately=
 argued against wholesale price caps claiming they nix new investment by se=
verely limiting return on investment.  If the controls are high enough -- l=
ike a $1,000 -- maybe that would be acceptable but nothing as low as what t=
he Democrats want, he said.
Now that the "Bush FERC" is in place, Congress isn't needed to tinker with =
price controls, he concluded.=20
The current energy bill is a good legacy for Chairman Bingaman to use in cr=
afting "meaningful" legislation, Murkowski suggested.=20
Texas residents
may be staying away from electric choice.  IOUs have signed up only about 6=
0,000 residentials so far while 265,000 are eligible for the pilot.  Busine=
ss customers have flocked into the pilot totaling 839,053 of an eligible 1,=
329,259 -- 63%.
Selling stable prices
works for NewPower
in California
Yes, the California market is open for retail gas competition.  It's been o=
pen for maybe a decade but few have found the market attractive until now.=
=20
NewPower is going in selling a two-year fixed price package that really app=
eals in today's world of price spiking.=20
The fixed price insulates customers from price spikes in the volatile Calif=
ornia marketplace.
NewPower's Terry Cohen relates that the firm expects to sign up 16,000 cust=
omers.  They'll have the opportunity to lock in gas at 98? a therm, compare=
d to an average PG&E price last January of $1.40 a therm.
The LDCs change their price monthly with a filing to the PUC=20
based on what their costs have been.
NewPower's deal is available to retail customers in 37 northern California =
counties, including San Francisco and Sacramento.
Before the announcement, New Power already had 600,000 gas and electric cus=
tomers in 19 markets.=20
5 stories in 1 minute:
Pat Wood to chair
FERC now:  Patrick Henry Wood was sworn in as a FERC member in Texas yester=
day.  Vice President Dick Cheney told Fortune magazine that Wood will be de=
signated chairman by the president.=20
Gas competition
ends in Wisc:  Wisconsin Gas found out what it wanted to know about retail =
competition by way of a five-year pilot program and is now going back to be=
ing a conventional regulated monopoly.  The 1,838 residentials and 1,647 co=
mmercial customers revert to the utility after having been served at one po=
int by nine suppliers and now four as the program ends.  The biggest findin=
g we assume was that you lose customers.  Costs of the program were subsidi=
zed.  Had they been passed on to consumers, prices would have been higher, =
the gas company figures, and we seriously question.
Mark Dempsey has been named West Virginia president for American Electric P=
ower. The former AEP public policy vice president has been with AEP for 25 =
years.
Energy views cost
Bush bigtime:  Voter doubts over President Bush's environmental and energy =
policies is hurting his approval rating, down eight points to 55% in May. H=
alf the voters polled criticized those policies.
Sempra would
store gas in
Baja California:  Sempra and El Paso Energy are among companies reportedly =
hoping to take advantage of California's power crunch by building or partne=
ring in liquid natural gas terminals in Baja California.  Sempra soon is to=
 announce a $350 million project between Ensenada and the US border.  Sempr=
a owns America's largest gas distributor, Southern California Gas.=20

  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=
rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =
Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=
r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=
nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=
nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=
 not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=
o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =
going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=
nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=
ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=
 Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=
 best, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09

   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn John=
son , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of T=
ampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee=
 bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sor=
e right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in t=
he morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying th=
at it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not h=
ave played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith =
, RB! D! AL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despit=
e having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over=
 Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all=
 right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degr=
ee the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off t=
he field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the Ne=
w York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday,=
 but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpe=
pper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Cu=
lpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is no=
t expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, =
and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statist=
ical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN=
 - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr=
ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard r! un! , but the Br=
oncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap=
pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W=
R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he =
remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/=
Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Den=
ver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a=
 big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedu=
le.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine pa=
sses for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment=
, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway i=
s finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jone=
s , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle=
 to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of hi=
s catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his num=
bers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the=
 tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB =
BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya=
rds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do=
wnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f=
rom Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
8/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While P=
rice is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for=
 Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated =
10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two=
 TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completin=
g key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alex=
ander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=
 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan=
der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat=
tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better =
defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty U=
pdated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami=
's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fant=
asy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28! /0!  McKni=
ght caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a f=
umble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally producti=
ve.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to jus=
t 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistentl=
y good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Ama=
ni Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He rem! ai! ns a must-start Fantasy pl=
ayer, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull=
 Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was he=
ld out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the=
 Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the bal=
l.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 y=
ards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic=
 QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , =
RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but =
was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for=
 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and shoul=
d post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll =
Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither b=
ack is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charli=
e Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 =
yards and a touchdown Su! nd! ay at Philadelphia. This outing could put him=
 firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remain=
s sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed =
for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at =
Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and =
we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNab=
b , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and =
no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either.=
 It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defen=
se, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump righ=
t now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback ov=
er the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated=
 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He ha=
sn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think eit=
her player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.=
  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine pas=
ses for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been a=
n inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a =
worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game=
. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - =
Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two =
interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsiste=
nt he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on =
him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Upd=
ated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and re=
corded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has bee=
n somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don'=
t let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you=
 consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touc=
hdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a=
 scor! e ! in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for=
 the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We d=
on't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith ,=
 RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizo=
na late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 8=
3 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson ,=
 QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third =
quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for f=
urther examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he retu=

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Michael Vick , QB ATL - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/16/01 Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against =
Green Bay. He may see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not=
 worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him vi=
rtaully worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper le=
ague, continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting! n! od.  =
 Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kelly is doubtful for =
Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury. He'll be replaced by =
Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from Kelly from this poin=
t on.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Martin hasn't be=
en a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't change this week=
end against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass defense, so star=
ting Martin isn't advisable.    Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15=
/01 According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starti=
ng spor this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike Ande=
rson.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/15/01 According to pub=
lished reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday. There is still no o=
ffical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.  James Stewart ,! R! B DET - H=
unter Updated 11/15/01 Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. =
He may miss Sunday's game against the Cardinals.   Edgerrin James , RB IND =
- JWillie Updated 11/15/01 According to published reports, it has been conf=
irmed that James will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. He wi=
ll need surgery to repair a torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for t=
he rest of the year, and Kevin McDougal should be his backup.  Jeff Graham =
, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Graham may post good numbers at Oakla=
nd. San Diego will look to the air often if the Raiders concentrate on stop=
ping the run.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Tomlin=
son may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will be fi=
red up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.  Jerry Ri=
ce , WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/15/01 Rice has not helped his Fantasy o=
wners much in recent weeks. But he is still worth a start against the incon=
sistent San Diego secondary. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 B=
rown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his b=
est in intradivisional matchups.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated=
 11/15/01 Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. A returning Tyro=
ne Wheatley will steal some of his carries against the tough San Diego run =
defense.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles  Updated 11/15/01 Wheatley is =
now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He is a risky s=
tart because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the San Diego def=
ense.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 Gannon should rebound=
 from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an important home game with San =
Diego.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Gary was inactive fo=
r the last two games, but he will now see carries again because Terrell Dav=
is is inj! ur! ed. He still may not play enough to help most Fantasy teams.=
  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Clark will continue =
to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB will now lean heavily=
 on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have crippled the Broncos a=
t wideout.  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Expect C=
arswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries at WR w=
ill make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.  Donovan McNabb=
 , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/15/01 McNabb had a huge game against Minneso=
ta last weekend, and should have more success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a t=
op-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of a weekly spot in your starting lineu=
p.   Freddie Mitchell , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Mitchell sprai=
ned his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this weekend against Dal=
las. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with a few more good ou=
tings, and is worth stashing away on your roster.   Keith Poole , WR DEN - =
Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for th=
e Broncos this week. Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole=
 into extra playing time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in t=
he past, so don't use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's =
passing game.  Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Pinkston ha=
s fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start to the seaso=
n. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't even worth a =
roster spot at this point.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15=
/01 Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one=
 of the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dall=
as earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10.   James Thrash , =
WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in =
his last two games, and is worth starting this week against Dallas. He may =
be inconsistent at times, but when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting=
 up solid Fantasy numbers.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 11/15/01=
 Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by in=
juries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers downf=
ield.  Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Galloway was te=
rrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan Leaf's inability t=
o get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in a deeper league, G=
alloway isn't worth starting in Week 10.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/15/01 Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown=
 last weekend, but he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deepe=
r Fantasy league, Harris isn't worth a roster spot.   Darrell Jackson , WR =
SEA - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Jackson has performed well this season, and h=
e is a good start again this week. Expect him to challenge the Buffalo seco=
ndary throughout the day.  Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
5/01 Ismail has been Dallas' most reliable reciever this season, which isn'=
t saying much. Unless you play in a very deep league, the "Rocket" is bette=
r left on the waiver wire.   Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/=
15/01 Alexander should have another standout game at Buffalo. It is doubtfu=
l the Bills' defense will be able to handle him, and he should be good for =
100-plus yards and at least one TD.  More Updates   NFL Reports, Transactio=

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

For additional information, visit HGO's web site at www.houstongrandopera.org. Also see volunteer opportunities below.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as
whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.

Randy,
I've been working with Matt regarding his VAR.  His component VAR points to this book having most risk? He is asking which curve in his ENA-FT-WT-ROX-B book drives most of his risk.  What needs to be done to fully understand this is to load into excel his position by curve and by risk type.  One spreadsheet for each unique curve (start with ones with most position).  Then simulate VAR on each excel file/position and the one with the highest VAR would be the one driving most of his risk.

The spreadsheet is picky, so everything has to be in caps, with no spaces or formulas in cells.

For ongoing solutions, rather than loading position into excel, perhaps you want Burton McIntyre to create sub portfolios for Matt segregated by the books that have his different major curves?

Let either myself or James or Bharat or Burton help you with this process.

Thanks
Frank

Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

  If you think the Bush tax cut plan is unfair, read this rebuttal that
appeared in the Sunday, March 4 Chicago Tribune. By the way, the ratios
are roughly accurate; 10% of the taxpayers pay about 60% of the taxes
collected, 30% pay 37%, and 60% collectively pay only 4%.

   Every night, 10 men met at a restaurant for dinner.  At the end of the
meal, the bill would arrive; they owed $100 for the food that they
shared. Every night they lined up in the same order at the cash register to
pay
the bill. The first four men paid nothing at all. The fifth, grumbling about
the
unfairness of the situation, paid $1.  The sixth man, feeling a little
put out, paid $3.  The next three men paid $7, $12 and $18, respectively. The
last man was required to pay the remaining balance, $59; he realized he
was paying for not only his own meal but the unpaid balance left by the
first five men.
   The 10 men were quite settled into their routine when the restaurant
threw them into chaos by announcing that it was cutting its prices.  Now
dinner for the 10 men would only cost $80.  This clearly would not affect
the first four men; they still ate for free. The fifth man announced he
would now pay nothing either.  The sixth man lowered his contribution by
1/3, and paid only $2.  The seventh man deducted $2 from his usual
payment and paid only $5.  The eighth man paid $9 instead of his usual $12.
The
ninth man paid $12, $6 less than before.  This left the last man with a
bill of $52. Outside of the restaurant, the men began to compare their
savings, and
angry outbursts began to erupt.  The sixth man yelled: "I got only $1 out
of the $20 in cost reduction, and he got $7," pointing at the last man.
The fifth man joined in: "Yeah!  I only saved $1 too.  It is unfair that
he got seven times more than me."  The seventh man cried, "Why should he
get a reduction of $7 when I only got $2?"

   The nine men formed an outraged mob, (this is where the Democratic
party aggravates everyone about the unfairness) surrounding the 10th man.
The
first four men followed the lead of the others: "Even though we weren't
paying anything in the first place, we didn't get any of the $20 reduction in
cost; where is our share?"  The nine angry men then carried the 10th
man up to the top of a hill and lynched him.

   The next night, the nine remaining men met at the restaurant for
dinner. But when the bill came, there was no one to pay it.

---Go W!

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10.

We have conference room 6716 from 3:00 to 4:00 each day for OPS.  I have not inspected the room to see if it will accommodate our entire group.   

Thanks,

Subject: Delta Flight 15 
This is a GREAT story! 
****************************************************************** 
Here is the story from Nazim-Amin: "Nazim" is a Delta 
Airline employee - one of the cockpit crew. 
We were about 5 hours out of Frankfurt flying over the 
North Atlantic and I was in my crew rest seat taking 
my scheduled rest break.  All of a sudden the curtains 
parted violently and I was told to go to the cockpit, 
right now, to see the captain. 
As soon as got there I noticed that the crew had one 
of those "All Business" looks on their faces.  The 
captain handed me a printed message.  I quickly read 
the message and realized the importance of it. The 
message was from Atlanta, addressed to our flight 
and simply said, "All airways over the Continental US 
are closed. Land ASAP at the nearest airport, advise 
your destination." 
Now, when a dispatcher tells you to land immediately 
without suggesting which airport, one can assume 
that the dispatcher has reluctantly given up control 
of the flight to the captain.  We knew it was a serious 
situation and we needed to find terra firma quickly. 
It was quickly decided that the nearest airport was 
400 miles away, behind our right shoulder, in Gander, 
on the island of New Foundland.  A quick request 
was made to the Canadian traffic controller and a 
right turn, directly to Gander, was approved immediately. 
We found out later why there was no hesitation by the 
Canadian controller approving our request. 
We, the in-flight crew, were told to get the airplane 
ready for an immediate landing. While this was going 
on another message arrived from Atlanta telling us 
about some terrorist activity in the New York area. We 
briefed the in-flight crew about going to Gander and 
we went about our business 'closing down'  the 
airplane for a landing. 
A few minutes later I went back to the cockpit to find 
out that some airplanes had been hijacked and were 
being flown into buildings all over the US.  We 
decided to make an announcement and LIE to the 
passengers for the time being.  We told them that an 
instrument problem had arisen on the airplane and 
that we needed to land at Gander, to have it checked. 
We promised to give more information after landing in 
Gander.  There were many unhappy passengers but 
that is par for the course. 
We landed in Gander about 40 minutes after the start 
of  this episode. There were already about 20 other 
airplanes on the ground from all over the world. 
After we parked on the ramp the captain made the 
following announcement. "Ladies and gentlemen, 
you must be wondering if all these airplanes around 
us have the same instrument problem as we have. 
But the reality is that we are here for a good reason." 
Then he went on to explain the little bit we knew 
about the situation in the US.  There were loud gasps 
and stares of disbelief. 
Local time at Gander was 12:30 pm. (11:00 AM EST) 
Gander control told us to stay put.  No one was 
allowed to get off the aircraft.  No one on the ground 
was allowed to come near the aircrafts.  Only a car 
from the airport police would come around once in a 
while, look us over and go on to the next airplane. 
In the next hour or so all the airways over the North 
Atlantic were vacated and Gander alone ended up 
with 53 airplanes from all over the world, out of which 
27 were flying US flags. 
We were told that each and every plane was to be 
offloaded, one at a time, with the foreign carriers 
given the priority.  We were No.14 in the US category. 
We were further told that we would be given a tentative 
time to deplane at 6 pm. Meanwhile bits of news 
started to come in over the aircraft radio and for the 
first time we learned that airplanes were flown into the 
World Trade Center in New York and into the Pentagon 
in DC. 
People were trying to use their cell phones but were 
unable to connect due to a different cell system in 
Canada.  Some did get through but were only able to 
get to the Canadian operator who would tell them that 
the lines to the US were either blocked or jammed and 
to try again. 
Some time late in the evening the news filtered to us 
that the World Trade Center buildings had collapsed 
and that a fourth hijacking had resulted in a crash. 
Now the passengers were totally bewildered and 
emotionally exhausted but stayed calm as we kept 
reminding them to look around to see that we were 
not the only ones in this predicament.  There were 52 
other planes with people on them in the same situation. 
We also told them that the Canadian Government was 
in charge and we were at their mercy. 
True to their word, at 6 PM, Gander airport told us 
that our turn to deplane would come at 11 AM, the next 
morning.  That took the last wind out of the 
passengers and they simply resigned and accepted this 
news without much noise and really started to get into a 
mode of spending the night on the airplane.  Gander 
had promised us any and all medical attention if  needed; 
medicine, water and lavatory servicing.  And they were 
true to their word.  Fortunately we had no medical situation 
during the night.  We did have a young lady who was 33 
weeks into her pregnancy. We took REALLY good care 
of her. The night passed without any further complications 
on our airplane despite the uncomfortable sleeping 
arrangements. 
About 10:30 on the morning of the 12th we were told to 
get ready to leave the aircraft. A convoy of school 
buses showed up at the side of the airplane, the 
stairway was hooked up and the passengers were taken 
to the terminal for "processing".  We, the crew, were 
taken to the same terminal but were told to go to a 
different section, where we were processed through 
Immigration and customs and then had to register with 
the Red Cross.  After that we were isolated from our 
passengers and were taken in a caravan of vans to a 
very small hotel in the town of Gander.  We had no 
idea where our passengers were going. 
The town of Gander has a population of 10,400 people. 
Red Cross told us that they were going to process 
about 10,500 passengers from all the airplanes that 
were forced into Gander.  We were told to just relax 
at the hotel and wait for a call to go back to the 
airport, but not to expect that call for a while.  We 
found out the total scope of the terror back home 
only after getting to our hotel and turning on the TV, 
24 hours after it all started. 
Meanwhile we enjoyed ourselves going around town 
discovering things and enjoying the hospitality.  The 
people were so friendly and they just knew that we 
were the "Plane people".  We all had a great time 
until we got that call, 2 days later, on the 14th at 7AM. 
We made it to the airport by 8:30AM and left for 
Atlanta at 12:30 PM arriving in Atlanta at about 4:30PM. 
(Gander is 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of EST, yes! 1 
hour and 30 minutes.) But that's not what I wanted to 
tell you. 
What passengers told us was so uplifting and 
incredible and the timing couldn't have been better. 
We found out that Gander and the surrounding 
small communities, within a 75 Kilometer radius, 
had closed all the high schools, meeting halls, lodges, 
and any other large gathering places. They converted 
all these facilities to a mass lodging area.  Some had 
cots set up, some had mats with sleeping bags and 
pillows set up.  ALL the high school students HAD 
to volunteer taking care of the "GUESTS". Our 218 
passengers ended up in a town called Lewisporte, 
about 45 kilometers from Gander.  There they were 
put in a high school. If any women wanted to be in 
a women only facility, that was arranged. Families 
were kept together.  All the elderly passengers were 
given no choice and were taken to private homes. 
Remember that young pregnant lady - she was put 
up in a private home right across the street from a 
24 hour Urgent Care type facility. There were DDS 
on call and they had both male and female nurses 
available and stayed with the crowd for the duration. 
Phone calls and emails to US and Europe were available 
for every one once a day. During the days the 
passengers were given a choice of "Excursion" trips. 
Some people went on boat cruises of the lakes and 
harbors.  Some went to see the local forests.  Local 
bakeries stayed open to make fresh bread for the guests. 
Food was prepared by all the residents and brought to 
the school for those who elected to stay put.  Others 
were driven to the eatery of their choice and fed. 
They were given tokens to go to the local Laundromat 
to wash their clothes, since their luggage was still on 
the aircraft. In other words every single need was met 
for those unfortunate travelers. 
Passengers were crying while telling us these stories. 
After all that, they were delivered to the airport 
right on time and without a single one missing or late. 
All because the local Red Cross had all the information 
about the goings on back at Gander and knew which 
group needed to leave for the airport at what time. 
Absolutely incredible. 
When passengers came on board, it was like they had 
been on a cruise.  Everybody knew everybody else 
by their name. They were swapping stories of their 
stay, impressing each other with who had the better 
time.  It was mind boggling. Our flight back to 
Atlanta looked like a party flight.  We simply stayed 
out of their way.  The passengers had totally bonded 
and they were calling each other by their first names, 
exchanging phone numbers, addresses and email 
addresses. 
And then a strange thing happened. One of our business 
class passengers approached me and asked if he 
could speak over the PA to his fellow passengers. We 
never, never, allow that.  But something told me to 
get out of his way.  I said "of course".  The gentleman 
picked up the PA and reminded everyone about what 
they had just gone through in the last few days. 
He reminded them of the hospitality they had received 
at the hands of total strangers.  He further stated that 
he would like to do something in return for the good 
folks of the town of Lewisporte.  He said he was going 
to set up a Trust Fund under the name of DELTA 15 
(our flight number).  The purpose of the trust fund is 
to provide a scholarship for high school student(s) 
of Lewisporte to help them go to college.  He asked 
for donations of any amount from his fellow travelers. 
When the paper with donations got back to us with 
the amounts, names, phone numbers and addresses, 
it totaled to $14.5K or about $20K Canadian. 
The gentleman who started all this turned out to be an 
MD from Virginia.  He promised to match the donations 
and to start the administrative work on the scholarship 
He also said that he would forward this proposal to 
Delta Corporate and ask them to donate as well.  Why, 
all of this?  Just because some people in far away places 
were kind to some strangers, who happened to literally 
drop in among them? 
WHY NOT?

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a
doughnut to complete the circle.  Has anyone fwded that mail to Coco?  I'm
sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

<<  The Sunday School teacher was speaking one Sunday morning and she asked  
the question, "When you die and go to Heaven which part of your body goes first?"  
Suzie raised her hand and said, "I think it's your hands."  "Why do you think it's your hands, Suzie?"  
Suzie replied, "Because when you pray, you hold your hands together in front of you and God just takes your hands first!"  
"What a wonderful answer!" the teacher said.  
Now, Tommy raised his hand and said, "Teacher, I think it's your legs."  
The teacher looked at him with the strangest look on her face.  "Now, Tommy, why do you think it would be your legs?"  
Tommy said, "Well, I walked into Mommy and Daddy's bedroom the other night.  
Mommy had her legs straight up in the air and she was going, "O God, I'm coming!"  If Dad hadn't had her pinned down, we'd a lost her for sure.

 for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a s=

HELLO! THIS IS AMERICA!  
Broken Arrow, Oklahoma School officials remove "God Bless America" signs from schools in fear that someone might be offended.  
Channel 12 News in Long Island, New York, orders flags removed from the newsroom and red, white, and blue ribbons removed from the lapels of reporters.  
Why?  
Management did not want to appear biased and felt that our nations flag might give the appearance that "they lean one way or another."  
Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the community.  
In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an American" signs removed so as to not offend international students.  
I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called American citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending some individual or their culture.  
Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others.  
I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America.  
In fact, our country's population is almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants; however, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some native Americans, need to understand.  
First of all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you in any way. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.  
As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language, and our own lifestyle.  
This culture, called the "American Way" has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.  
Our forefathers fought, bled, and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Korea, Vietnam,  
We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society -- learn our language!  
"In God We Trust" is our national motto.  
This is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan; it is our national motto.  
It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is printed on our currency.  
We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is clearly documented throughout our history.  
If it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.  
God is in our pledge, our National Anthem, nearly every patriotic song, and in our founding documents. We honor His birth, death, and resurrection as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis.  
If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him.  
We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Flag Day.  
We have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag.  
As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose.  
If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet.  
The American culture is our way of life, our heritage, and we are proud of it. We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from, if it was so superior, go home.  
We are Americans, like it or not, this is our country, our land, and our lifestyle.  
Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every opportunity to do so.  
But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom, the right to leave.  
If you agree, pass this onto other Americans!!  
It is time to take a stand!!  
MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA LAND THAT WE LOVE!!!

      Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

dated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His curren=
t status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Up! da! ted 11/2=
6/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccan=
eers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter=
 of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despit=
e being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineff=
ective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game=
. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  K=
eenan McCardell  , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs a=
nd caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good out=
ing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Isma=
il , WR BAL - McKay Neal Upd! at! ed 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to th=
ree catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail=
 remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most co=
mplete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jackson=
ville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic t=
o be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Marti=
n Cuilla Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards aga=
inst Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of =
the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed=
 for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yard=
s. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see=
 him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free =
Agent Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a=
 good day against Arizona nonetheless! . ! The rookie tailback had 145 scri=
mmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flu=
tie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing f=
or 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth s=
tarting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baj=
a Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is o=
nly a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Kl=
ap Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passe=
s for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most rel=
iable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly ba=
sis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a g=
ood outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a to=
uchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is wort=
h starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/=
01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against=
 New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is w=
orth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendal=
l Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the b=
all five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yar=
dage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fan=
tasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be =
able to take many carries away from Charli! e ! Garner.   Antowain Smith , =
RB NE - Baja Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two =
touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pret=
ty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting =
258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantas=
y player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots=
' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/=
01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the G=
iants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the mo=
st reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updated =
11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating =
a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return t=
o the game.  Eric Moulds  , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/25/01 Moulds f=
inally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards an=
d two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should s=
till remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. D=
on't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre=
 performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pel=
t had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one intercep=
tion. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he re=
mains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Updated=
 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not =
catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to st=
art for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , Q=
B MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs =
and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a=
 QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable F=
antasy QB.  ! Donovan McNabb  , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/01 The Red=
skins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or =
interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a qu=
iet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Thras=
h caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsisten=
t to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod G=
ardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caugh! t ! four passe=
s for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in t=
he past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch=
.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extens=
ive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carr=
ied 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your=
 Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac=
 Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the i=
njured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muham=
mad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to=

Subject:	Holiday Party - Canceled


I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

This is the Official Snowking Report for the Year
2002!

How bout Keystone/Vail/Breckenridge/"Beaver" Creek all
in one trip for the Amazing Price of $590.00. Yes,
that is correct - No Bullshit.

Listen Up-
This includes round trip tickets from N.O. to Denver.
5 Days/4 Nights in a Condo in Keystone (Either 2 BR/2
Bath or 3 BR/2 Bath w/ a fold out. Includes minivan,
since Keystone is approximately 91 miles from the
Denver Airport. Lift tickets for 4 Days at the
locations mentioned above (Sorry, only 2 days out of 4
can be at Vail or Beaver Creek.)

Dates: Jan. 10 - 14th (Thurs.-Mon.)

If you act now, they will also provide free snowjobs.
They also said if you ride a Harley Sportster all the
way from B.R.,they will just give the trip away. I
asked about pets -Dogs have to sleep outside, Sorry.

They have plenty of ski runs. One double black diamond
goes through the nig part of town, I suggest going w/
cjrob through this treacherous run and don't slow down
on the flat areas. Another goes straight to Oz - we
all know who will be hitting this green run in his
Pink bib and jacket. They also have a married couple
run, no further comments on this one. 00. I'll be on
the bunny slopes checking out the MILF'S and the
beginners. I hope to give a few lessons.

Anyway, who has questions or comments?

CE
Don't forget your swim trunks!

Although I have not seen Farris' balls personally (and thankfully), I have
seen some of the ladies he has been with; Very impressive....NEVERTHELESS, I
would have to call bullshit on his being, physically, the biggest set of
them all....lest we forget Brother Nathan Meyers?

Figuratively speaking, I will "bow out" to Farris' and Rhett Staehling's
balls' size for serving their country in these troubled times. Do we know of
any other brothers who have been called to serve?

Next weekend would be better for me. I was looking forward to stretching
this weekend out as much as possible... and not being in a car for 6 hours.

Boone will be pissed if we take off. He wants to booze on Saturday and
Sunday.


Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai=
nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week=
s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti=
nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/0=
1 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards =
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be=
! ca! use of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi=
s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=
 Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t=
he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo=
r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie =
RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=
 now. Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ba=
ll six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good num=
bers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay=
 Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and=
 caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his=
 owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDa=
inian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of=
 the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rooki=
e tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's=
 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a =
solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. Howe=
ver, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake =
Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Su=
nday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who als=
o threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David B=
oston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding =
game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. =
He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth=
 starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Jackson had ! a ! good outing against New England, catching five catch=
es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy =
receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - =
Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c=
arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often =
in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=
 for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=
 may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S=
mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens=
e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec=
ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE =
- Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the=
 Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the =
most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggr=
avating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not =
return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moul=
ds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yard=
s and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners shou=
ld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the yea=
r. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medi=
ocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van=
 Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one inte=
rception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as h=
e remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=
 not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable =
to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle=
r , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs a=
nd no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a =
QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fa=
ntasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins =
held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interc=
eptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet pe=
rformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo=
ur passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too ! in! consistent to be=
 a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner =
, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only =
33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few=
 weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana=
 Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action =
on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 time=
s for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy te=
am. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR =
CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhs=
in Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absen=
ce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.  =
 Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed! S! und=
ay's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next wee=
kend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexande=
r , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yar=
ds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander ma=
y continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chand=
ler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Su=
nday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to at=
tack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's p=
oor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01=
 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. =

Two things to say ...

You have entirely TOO MUCH TIME on your hands, not only to type up some
horse-shit note like this but also to think it up.  The joy that you must
have felt when LSU choked ... I can only imagine.

Secondly ... your smack seems to be directed in a totally different arena
than earlier in the year.  Let me see if I can remember ... oh yeah, "I am
buying my tickets to Pasadena now!!  UT will WITHOUT A DOUBT play for the
national championship in January".  Nice call ... or did you not have the
balls to put your money up ... you along with everyone else knows that UT
is, without a doubt, one of the most over-rated teams each and every
year!!!  The fact that you are now focusing on UT versus LSU only shows how
far your expectations have fallen.  You, along with every other
disallusioned Hook'em fan, need to realize that a national championship
doesn't run through Austin OR Mack Brown ... y'all are just pathetic!

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
"Overrated, Overrated".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called "Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al"
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's

   "Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   "The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   "LSU would whip UT"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   "UT is the most overrated team in college football" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   "Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was "tiger bait, tiger bait" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10.

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pa=
ss and was stopped for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has mis=
sed too much time to make a Fantasy impact this season.   Richard Huntley ,=
 RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Huntley actually had a good outing ag=
ainst San Francisco, posting 94 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, h=
e's far too inconsistent to start on a weekly basis.  ! Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Weinke started Sunday's game against San F=
rancisco after missing last week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up=
 decent numbers, throwing for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25=
-22 OT loss.   Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/18/01 Chrebet did n=
ot catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer worthy of a starti=
ng spot on Fantasy teams.   Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11=
/18/01 Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against =
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of m=
iraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last t=
wo weeks.   Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Van Pelt t=
hrew for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the Seahawks. He d=
id lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most of the game an=
d will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for the injured Ro=
b Johnson.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/18/01 Garcia had=
 another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns against Carolina=
. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this season, and may =
even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point.   Peerless Price ,=
 WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/01 Price caught 10 passes for 138 yard=
s and a TD against Seattle. He has clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy pl=
ayer this season.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent  Updated 11/18/01 =
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The=

4 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two interceptions ma=
de his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player a=
t this point, best used when the matchup is right in a deeper league.   Kor=
en Robinson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two pass=
es for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. =
Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not produce enough to be a rel=
iable Fantasy player.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/0=
1 Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunda=
y. However, with all the injured running backs around the league this seaso=
n, Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.   Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- Rocks Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 1=
72 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantas=
y player this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right.=
   Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive on=
ce again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati. He =
just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge Fant=
asy disappointment.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for ! 12! 0 yards and a touchdow=
n against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player=
, and is a must-start ever week.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing fo=
r 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games,=
 and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was c=
apable of.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/18/01 Man=
ning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and=
 a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, bu=

 TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, ca=
tching three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He m=
ay not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end dep=
th around the league makes him a valuable commodity.   Donovan McNabb , QB =
PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compili=
ng only 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the med=
iocre performance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in =
the league.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was hor=
rible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two in=
terceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas =
fell to Philadelphia, 36-3.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/18/0=

I was going to bed the other night when my wife told me that I had left 
the light on in the shed, she could see from the bedroom, window. As I 
looked for myself, I saw that there were people in the shed taking things. 
I phoned the police, but they told me that no one was in the area to help 
at this time, but they would send someone over as soon as they became 
available. I said OK, hung up, and waited one minute, then phoned the 
police back. 
"Hello. I just called you a minute ago because there were people in my 
shed.  Well, you don't have to worry about them now cause I've shot them all." 
Within a few minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area, an 
Armed Response unit, the works. 
Of course, they caught the burglars red-handed. One of the officers said: 
"I thought you said that you'd shot them!" 
I replied with "I thought you said there was nobody available!"

Sweet, I'm a millionaire! Ha. Not much in B.R.  I go to N.O. every weekend
because it is still boring until football cranks up.  I'm leaving for Europe
for six weeks and I have to get my addresses in order.  Thanks for replying,
hope all is well with you and keep in touch.

DAILY DATEBOOK
JON CARROLL
Enron is my spiritual teacher
Jon Carroll

06/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
E.10
(Copyright 2001)



THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha
does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have
said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things.


Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger.
They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be
toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.


Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant.
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and
meekly hand over tribute.


And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray
that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us
the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth.


We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great
dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we
understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they
wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did
we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or
alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not.


But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the
spirit of volunteerism is much praised.


Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do
but don't.


AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one,
we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money
using energy we didn't need.


I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about
washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for
the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances
plugged in but never used.


We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes
he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has.


Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money,
we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it!


Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social
criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it!
They will get away with it! You watch!


I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are
active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone
in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up
with any extra money.


We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now
we see. And we await developments, or create them.


--------------------------------------------------------


It would be foolish to mention SUVs. When the brain is ready, the ear will
hear.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

ters , RB SEA - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01 According to the Ta=
coma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will=
 return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be anot=
her month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren=
 said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup.=
 He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and=
 played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play agai=
n." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both back=
s on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Ale=
xander dow! n ! the stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10=
/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He ha=
s lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fant=
asy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's =
game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replace=
s Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pull=
ed groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fro! m ! a Fan=
tasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Who=
's Yo Daddy Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable f=
or next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determ=
ine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedr=
ic Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practic=
e due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, an=
d isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith ,=
 RB MIA - The Lie Downs Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due =
to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don'=
t be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nutwh=
ackers Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Min=
nis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapol=
is. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Co=
lts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cu=
t starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - The Snake! P! it Updated 10/=
23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due=
 to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR =
IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's ga=
me at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a F=
antasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/2=
3/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his come=
back game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided =
whether they will activate! h! im. He will work in practice this week and t=
he Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recom=
mend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's =
Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn ,=
 RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Time=
s, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn w=
on't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play o=
n Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updat=
ed 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he di=
dn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and =
was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 ya=
rds on! 1! 1 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend =
on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if =
your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is e=
xpected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/=
23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. =
However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN=
 - Meximullets Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury bu=
t is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected=
 to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Upda=
ted 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expecte=
d to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhac=
kers Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of =
a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's gam=
e.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean re=
ports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is =
expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, =
an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie=
 Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An M=
RI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred=
 Taylor , RB! J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been rul=
ed out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's ga=
me remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase=
 his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The F=
lorida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. =
Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make s=
ome kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has b=
een inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis North=
cutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game be=
cause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to act=
ion next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did =
not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is o=
ptimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inac=
tive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , R=
B BAL - The Guzzlers Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play =
of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's gam=
e. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill K! il! l Cult Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick =
expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the q=
uarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the =
chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the=
 cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have=
 to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to=
 play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/23/01 Haki=
m suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets=
. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against N=
ew Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - The Executioners Updated 10/23/01 A=
ccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in p=
lace of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect=
 Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 1=
00 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And =
if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy rep=
lacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantas=
y perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Who's Yo Daddy Upd=
ated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs=
, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came s=
o early. It was a blessing for me because ! I ! was able to get treatment e=
very day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I =
wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than=
 mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves =
himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - oops, I did it again=
 Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back =
in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for=
 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his su=
rgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - =
Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the P=
hiladelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-d=
ay.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - oops, I did it again Updated 10/23/01 Accor=
ding to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game agai=
nst New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"=
 Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. =
He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let h=
im play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's =
unable to go.    More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc =

 Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart =

econd half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because =
of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already pla=
ying with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will =
get an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, the=
y are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I proba=
bly could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain." =
 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced hi=
mself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17=
-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, =
but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn'=
t know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was abl=
e to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next=
 week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evalu=
ated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.  =
   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 According to =
published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game agains=
t Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.!  Eddie Kennison ,=
 WR DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yar=
ds against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has r=
everted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. =
  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed fo=
r only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eigh=
t-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37=
 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this y=
ear.!  David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught =
five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a sco=
ring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  =
Troy Brown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes =
for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 y=
ards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive t=
eams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Upd=
ated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In t=
he past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug F=
lutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations =
as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/0=
1 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two=
 passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and =
Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seem=
s to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside! =
t! he red zone.   Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Ce=
nters was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. Th=
e Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Ri=
emersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Pr=
ice , WR BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for=
 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he app=
ears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt=
 Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best =
game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he=
 continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball=
 downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine=
 Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Co=
nsidering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers look=
ed respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to =
post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his=
 overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/=
01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wide=
out is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  =
James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight=
 passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami=
 receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne ,=
 RB NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards=
 on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good num=
bers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer =
, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for =
109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy play=
er, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Executi=
oners Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but w=
as held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, bu=
t the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move th=
e ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for =
190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, no! w ! th=
e erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce =
Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday ag=
ainst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, wi=
th two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush =
defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears no=
ting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which sugge=
sts that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both ris=
ky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10/28/! =
01!  Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadel=
phia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured ba=
ck while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Exe=
cutioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns =
and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall=
 challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bet=
ter stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhacker=
s Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunda=
y against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lo=
t for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was st=
ill a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he shoul=
d break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half =
of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pit=
tman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been muc=
h better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player wi=
ll be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Bosto=
n , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes fo=
r 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inco=
nsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy=
 player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's=
 easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, =
I did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns=
 and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how i=
nconsistent he can be. Unless! t! he matchup dictates otherwise, you should=
n't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Su=
nday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' def=
ense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the match=
up, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit w=
ill give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 ya=
rds, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23=
 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't g=
reat for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' seconda=
ry. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  More U=

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

Best regards,
Billy Lemmons

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

?	Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
?	Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
?	Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
?	Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
?	Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
?	Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
?	Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
?	McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
?	Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
?	Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
?	Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
?	Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
?	Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
?	The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
?	McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
?	Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
?	Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
?	Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
?	The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
?	$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
?	Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
?	No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
?	Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
?	Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
?	McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
?	Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
?	Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
?	McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
?	McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
?	ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

    Patrick Jeffers  , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01   Jeffers hopes=
 to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers p=
lay host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior crucia=
te ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsbu=

be activated Sunday for the first time this season. "They said it looks lik=

 It's another step along the way." Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will s=

ner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01   Stoerner will start at quarte=
rback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony W=
right, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending=
 surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fant=
asy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, b=
ut was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this yea=
r. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas.     Edgerrin James  =
, RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/26/01   James hyperextended his left kn=
ee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not retu=

eiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodg=

 Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the inj=
ury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should re=

ion that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game agai=
nst the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed=
 as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.   =
  Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been =
named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the inju=
ry is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the inj=
ury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sway=
ne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider us=
ing Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swin=
ton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering f=
rom a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday.=
 Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  ,=
 WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's=
 game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Alle=

Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder inju=

on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 10/25/01=
   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday=
's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Freddie Jones  =

Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable.     Joey Gall=
oway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Galloway's status for Sunday=
's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from =
a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.     Charlie B=
atch  , QB DET - Rocks Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wedne=
sday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that h=
e is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  =
, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play agai=
n this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pai=
n in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as we=
ll because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - The Klap Updated=
 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out b=
ecause of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated =
10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City=
 due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the =
starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/25/0=
1   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston =
Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still =
recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg=
 holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - FIBSABs=
 Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility th=
at Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he=
 is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individ=
ual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Top Dogs Updated 10/25/01  =
 Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record .=
 He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco B=

in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Update=
d 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavi=
cle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for seve=

e.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has =
responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Na=
shville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-=
oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone=
 Wheatley  , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not p=
ractice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon =

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
! h! asn't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration =
in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Fo=
otball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last tw=
o games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom=
 Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick=
 announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for =
the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to=
 a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady migh=
t have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fai=
rly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/=
21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seaso=
n due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to =
rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abse=
nce hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more b=
y opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.!   Marvin Minnis , WR KC - =
Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's=
 game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 1=
1 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup =
at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell=
 , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sid=
eline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours b=
efore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to=
 a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he wi=
ll start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as=
 you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Tayl=
or received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groi=
n injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder o=
f the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that =
the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, =
and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain! i! n his hip, a side effect =
of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again =
this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a fin=
al decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith ,=
 WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enou=
gh for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss=
 Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggrav=
ated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smi=
th on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bro=
ncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it =
would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 1=
1/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Ale=
xander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during =
their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against t=
he Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patri=
ots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's =
No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. B=
rady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to you! r ! rost=
er as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadric=
eps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game. =
 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has=
 not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times=
 . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Sha=
un Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as =
the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/2=
0/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy=
 involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterba=
ck," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is no=
ne within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get =
us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought t=
o satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated =
11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder=
 injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because B=
ruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  =
Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contr=
a-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects t=
o play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinn=
ey (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to =
return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated=
 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a=
 risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's=
 practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to=
 miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Up=
dated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to=
 start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may =
have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/=
20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game=
 against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jer=
ome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the s=
eason. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurti=
ng, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting =
lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told =
the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup =
Ra! y ! right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the s=
tarter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play =
turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike=
 Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently heale=
d to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to ev=
aluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he=
 can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he ca=
n't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep h=
im out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how=
 much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in s=
ome of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend aga=
inst Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the w=
ide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Ba=
nks , QB WAS - Free Agent U! pd! ated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks =
will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concus=
sion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the =
injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to pract=
ice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and =
is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Marti=
n Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the=
 overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries are=
n't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the startin=

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

<<  The Sunday School teacher was speaking one Sunday morning and she asked  
the question, "When you die and go to Heaven which part of your body goes first?"  
Suzie raised her hand and said, "I think it's your hands."  "Why do you think it's your hands, Suzie?"  
Suzie replied, "Because when you pray, you hold your hands together in front of you and God just takes your hands first!"  
"What a wonderful answer!" the teacher said.  
Now, Tommy raised his hand and said, "Teacher, I think it's your legs."  
The teacher looked at him with the strangest look on her face.  "Now, Tommy, why do you think it would be your legs?"  
Tommy said, "Well, I walked into Mommy and Daddy's bedroom the other night.  
Mommy had her legs straight up in the air and she was going, "O God, I'm coming!"  If Dad hadn't had her pinned down, we'd a lost her for sure.

layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0=
1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w=
as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=
 this year and has become a major scoring! t! hreat even though he is not v=
ery effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Martin =
Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards =
receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the mos=
t part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough=
 to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - The Klap Updated 10/21/01 Green thre=
w for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has be=
en inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod=
 every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman=
 rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were no=
t great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Ch=
apman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay h=
ealthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated =
10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven reception=
s for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in =
the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic! ha! el Pittman ,=
 RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cui=
lla Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching =
seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not re=
liable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roste=
r spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Tomlins=
on was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. Th=
e rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one o=
f the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes fo=
r 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tigh=
t ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly =
basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st=
arted Sunday's! g! ame against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted=
 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 los=
s.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eigh=
t passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideou=
t is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Cor=
ey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to=
 just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from=
 such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinn=
ati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent r=
ole in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clear=
ly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' fe=
atured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent =
Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at De! =
tr! oit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch=
 Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.=
   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yard=
s, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has sta=
cked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy ris=
k because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks U=
pdated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice =
at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws wer=
e inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder pr=
oblems.  Eddie George, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51=
 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Ten=
nessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson ,=
 WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 =
yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of=
 inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Cru=
mpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01  Crumpler caught five passes f=
or 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, =
quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards again=
st Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout. =
 Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with=
 only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numb=
ers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa!=
 ble of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT =
- Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches=
 by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, =
but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to cons=
istently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 1=
0/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the =
week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh=
 defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had =
a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two sc=
ores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to pos=
t good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality playe=
rs.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 1=
0 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field=
 relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to =
post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bet! ti!  , RB PIT - =
Fear Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries ag=
ainst Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Be=
ttis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New Yor=
k Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the =
Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of=
 stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
1/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, po! st! ing six catches for 208 yar=
ds and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbro=

     Player Updates NFL Reports   [IMAGE] Latest NFL Player News    Tim Bia=
kabutuka  , RB CAR - Baja Updated 10/25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until =
at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his r=
ight foot. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be =
football related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "=
Basically, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka'=
s foot. "The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put bac=
k together." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting =
lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the inju=
ry was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play=
 again.        James Stewart  , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/25/01  =
 Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free=
 Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruis=
e and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/25/01   C=
hrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolin=
a with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive=
 tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. I=
t was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of=
 the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. =
Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines"=
 and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chr=
ebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will=
 be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the =
starting lineup.       Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/25/01=
   Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and =
could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to pl=
ay this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and=
 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been =
well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on th=
e scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against=
 the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly i=
njury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if h=
e does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday beca=
use of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave =
Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready t=
o play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoer=
ner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He h=
as played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and tw=
o touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB=
 DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday becau=
se of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might =
not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday,=
 and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's play=
ing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner=
 would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo=
 said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunda=
y. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a startin=
g spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   D=
avis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg =
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. =
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg i=
s throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis i=
s able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Too=
mer  , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   According to published report=
s, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will=
 join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Mond=
ay night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 y=
ards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to mot=
ivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet wi=
ll miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards =
described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted t=
o be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the vari=
ous tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne,=
 a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL durin=
g the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and=
 has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He =
will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is uncle=
ar.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed=
 with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a rec=
eiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Cr=
owell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking h=
im up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day =
to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game aga=
inst Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - FIBSABs Updated 10/24/01   T=
he Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn p=
atella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , W=
R NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is=
 still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery.=
 The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB=
 GB - The Klap Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to g=
eneral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be full=
y recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent =
Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to =
the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still w=
orking with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which =
player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET =
- Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foste=
r is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati=
. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy le=
agues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Ro=
binson  , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson o=
n injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectiv=
ely ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil=
 Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinna=
ti Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. R=
ackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of hi=
s erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   =
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He =
will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle.=
 He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jure=
vicius  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his =
starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Ju=
revicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he wil=
l be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return =
to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent t=
his season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's ga=
me while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and =
is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked wit=
h the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to sa=
y for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiave=
rini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey =
Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as qu=
estionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are =
optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained f=
oot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is =
questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the=
 next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaveri=
ni  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday an=
d is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is reco=
vering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Rocks Updated=
 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday witho=
ut any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky W=
atters  , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tr=
ibune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to =
the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month o=
r longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I w=
ould be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our=
 best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played wel=
l. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you =
have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your t=
eam to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down=
 the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dil=
fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the=
 starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy roster=
s at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01=
   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game =
against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Tr=
ent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled g=
roin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy per=
spective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Upd=
ated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunda=
y's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the exten=
t of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    More Updates   =
 Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Matt Lenhart Player News    Isaac Bruce  , A=
ctive WR Updated 10/22/01  Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunda=
y, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to r=
un the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. L=
ook for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.    Tony Banks  , R=
eserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on=
 Sunday, throwing for 346 yards and a score against Carolina. His performan=
ce doesn't make him any more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, =
so don't consider him any better than a reserve.    Corey Dillon  , Active =
RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. =
Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very=
 quickly.    Johnnie Morton  , Reserve WR Updated 10/19/01  Morton could ha=
ve a big game this weekend against Tennessee. The Titans' secondary has bee=
n shaky at best, so the positive matchup makes Morton a good start from a F=
antasy perspective.    Cris Carter  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Expect go=
od numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will not be f=
lustered by the improved Green Bay defense.    Kerry Collins  , Reserve QB =
Updated 10/18/01  Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his nu=
mbers against Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best opti=
on Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterba=
ck.    Eric Moulds  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Moulds might get in the e=
nd zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often a=
gainst the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.    Peerless Price  , Reserve W=
R Updated 10/18/01  Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguar=
s. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.    Stephen Davis  =
, Active RB Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent game of the season=
 on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due t=
o Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup=
, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.    Rickey Du=
dley  , Reserve TE Updated 10/09/01  The Browns have placed Dudley on injur=
ed reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he=
 was on your Fantasy roster.    Steve Beuerlein  , Active QB Updated 10/05/=
01  The Broncos placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his s=
eason. He has been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't=
 worth holding on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your le=
ague.    Dolphins  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  Linebacker Zach Thomas suf=
fered a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during S=
unday's loss to St. Louis. "It's just real sore," Thomas told the Miami Her=
ald . "I'm going to try to play [Sunday]." His knee is very stiff right now=
, however, so don't be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East c=
ontest against New England.    Raiders  , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01  The =
Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he to=
re his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surger=
y this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. I=
n other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the=
 Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson i=
s questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder=
.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover needs just nine more =
field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL singl=
e-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chan=
ces against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playof=

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs =
Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting h=
im on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go u=
p against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him out=
side of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt =
continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only th=
ree touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t! hi!=
 s weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his=
 potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart U=
pdated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, bu=
t he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law=
 and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting ba=
sed on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Nea=
l Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he =
is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every wee=
k, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Co=
nwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down wee=
ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the =
lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is =
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Hunt=
ley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 ! Hu! ntley will be the likely s=
tarter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he spl=
its carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at a=
ll possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had=
 only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been un=
reliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. =
   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been =
held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better t=
ight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the=
 past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six =
passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past ag=
ainst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move=
.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of t=
he best F! an! tasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an A=
tlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start=
 Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Fran=
ks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight g=
ames makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option o=
n your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekl=
y basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankl=
e) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sund=
ay against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose seco=
ndary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Drough=
ns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time w=
ith Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's ab=
sence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and s=
tarting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart o=
n Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is o=
nly worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   Charlie Ba=
tch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Batch will again lose playing time to=
 Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will be the No. 2 QB again, but will see p=
laying time as the Lions continue to use two quarterbacks. As a result, you=
 may want to look for another signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. =
   David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sloan is an unreliabl=
e tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for minus-2 yard performance=
 in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Sloan isn't adv=
isable.   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/01 Dayne has bee=
n a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He may score=
 a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fantasy own=
ers overall.   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Colli=
ns has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week! a! gainst =
Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards passing an=
d five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is worth taking=
 a chance on in Week 10.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/=
16/01 Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games thi=
s season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous Minn=
esota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy lea=
gues.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Wycheck sat ou=
t practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed as questionable=
 for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if he plays.   Ike =
Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Hilliard has caught th=
ree touchdowns in his last three games, so starting him against Minnesota i=
s advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable at best, so look for Hi=
lliard to be productive.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/16=
/01 Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. =
The Viking! s ! sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starti=
ng Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - T=
he Klap Updated 11/16/01 Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will re=
main the starter in Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated =
that Olandis Gary would start in his place.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Bennett is expected to return to action after miss=
ing three game with a high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Do=
ug Chapman on Monday night against the Giants, making him a risky start on =
your Fantasy team.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/0=
1 Pathon (foot) is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie =
Wayne should start in his place.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/16/01 Alexander (ankle) did not practice on Thursday, and is doub=
tful for Sunday's game against Denver. William ! Ra! sby and Zeron Flemiste=
r will likely split time at tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither p=
layer has any real Fantasy value.   Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 11/16=
/01 Linebacker Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday agains=
t Denver. "We wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective," Re=
dskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. "I think he'll =
be effective." He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle a few weeks=
 ago.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Wheatle=
y has strep throat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now questionable=
 for Sunday's game as he also makes his way back from a knee injury.   Eagl=
es , DT PHI - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed pr=
actice on Wednesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to p=
ractice, however, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dal=
las.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kinney missed pr=

lenn  , WR NE - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sund=
ay's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running=
 but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring=
 injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating=
 him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - The Executioners Updated 10/25/01 =
  The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might b=
e able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under hi=
s playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills=
.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be=
 able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed t=
he past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE C=
IN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report=
 as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game=
 at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Joh=
nson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cin=
cinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. =
Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris San=
ders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well t=
o back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennesse=
an . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team an=
d won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB =
OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday b=
ecause of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Con=
tra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable fo=
r Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - The Lie=
 Downs Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did =
not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is =
recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     =
Jacquez Green  , WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as=
 questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a =
groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable t=
o play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/25/01   Dunn pa=
rticipated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his=
 recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevert=
heless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against M=
innesota.     Ike Hilliard  , WR NYG - oops, I did it again Updated 10/25/0=
1   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot, acc=
ording to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Giants gam=
e against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep an eye =
on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidelines if =
it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   J=
ones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida=
 Times-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury=
. Kyle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if Jones is unable to =
play.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Joseph too=
k a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the t=
hird-down back, according to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have mu=
ch value in this job but he will take carries away from starter Stacey Mack=
.     Tyrone Davis  , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Davis could ret=
urn from his hamstring injury sooner than what was originally expected, acc=
ording to published reports. He might begin practicing next week and will a=
lmost certainly be activated before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis =
has been sidelined since August because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless,=
 he will be the No. 2 tight end when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL =
- Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/25/01   Grbac will likely be a game-time deci=
sion for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very litt=
le in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham=
 will start if Grbac is unable to play.      Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Meximul=
lets Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achil=
les tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday=
 but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR ATL - The Snake P=
it Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume=
 their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games =
because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports=
 that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity =
 , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, =
who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used =
mostly on returns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' re=
gular rotation of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL - The Snake Pit Updat=
ed 10/25/01   Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kick=
ing off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published rep=
orts. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering St=
eve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Met=
calf  , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Washington Redskins sign=
ed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minim=
al Fantasy value.      Tim Biakabutuka  , RB CAR - The Guzzlers Updated 10/=
25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fractur=
e and other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be real=
ly ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer," =
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated," Seifer=
t said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons and b=
one broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley, who wil=
l replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the h=
ospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and=
 he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.        James Stewart  , RB DE=
T - The Lie Downs Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on Sunday a=
gainst the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury ha=
s now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  =
, WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' to=
p receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was =
hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday=
 and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive =
week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' =
win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards describe=
d Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be ext=
ra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=
 and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his a=
bsence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrel=
l Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors th=
at he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the seaso=
n. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said=
. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted th=
at his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the =
scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as t=
he Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. =
Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother =
to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        =
Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterba=
ck Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right k=
nee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would s=
tart ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in y=
our starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player f=
rom Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three gam=
es, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two app=
earances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right kn=
ee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright e=
xpected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't=
 make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona =
game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan =
Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chan=
ce that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't b=
een with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell =
Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/24/01   Davis is sufficiently heal=
ed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems an=
d will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress=
 fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderso=
n will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which see=
ms unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - The Fat B=
astards Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be =
benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if=
 Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against th=
e Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Ji=
m Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayn=
e Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss S=
unday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described=
 Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extr=
a cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=
 and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-yea=
r-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the pas=
t year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one =
catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be r=
e-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Mo=

I think I will be visiting Rhett in Turkey this year for New Years. It

a camoflouge theme and they will be serving MRE's buffet style. Rhett
will
be the guest of honor since he is the oldest peice of shit still in the

I am out for Chateau Porteous, I would rather have a terrible time like
I
always do for New Years without the $250.00 plus tuxedo overhead.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

some of these ideas as nearly riskless as the stocks are oversold to the po=
int where they are trading below the cash they have per share with little o=

e the potential to rebound to at least their cash values with the NASDAQ su=
rging nicely.   We have delayed the release of this exciting edition as sev=
eral of the companies had yet to release September quarterly financial stat=

 money on this stock don't blame it on us. This is the fourth major high vo=
lume surge the stock has enjoyed this year, and we believe there is more to=
 come.   After the meteoric rise to $5.37, the stock pulled back to the $3.=
50 level, and has now stabilized just under $4. Up or down from here is any=
body's guess in the short term, but high volume surges to the upside are th=

   While the short term trading activity is exciting, the long term prospec=

Toronto Star which we believe is a must read for anyone following Energy Po=

l   CECO Environmental - Industry Leader Calls For Higher Government Standa=
rds For Air Ventilation Systems To Tackle Threat Of Bioterrorism  NEW YORK-=
-(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The supplier of filtration systems to the =
U.S. military's chemical weapons destruction program, CECO Environmental (N=
ASDAQ: CECE - news), is calling on governments to implement higher standard=
s for air ventilation systems in public buildings, including airports, subw=
ays, shopping centers and schools.    The FBI has warned of the potential f=
or the release of toxic chemicals, such as cyanide, into air handling syste=
ms of public buildings. Such systems have one or more fresh air intakes and=
 a blower or similar device that moves the air through the ventilation syst=
em.    ``Currently many of these facilities have no effective filters at al=
l in their ventilation systems,'' says Phil DeZwirek, CECO's Chairman and C=
EO. ``Ventilation systems generally are woefully outdated and there is noth=
ing forcing contractors to upgrade them.'' The Building and Office Manageme=
nt Association (BOMA) has told its members that the release of a toxic chem=
ical into an air handling system is a credible threat. ``Any release would =
be spread throughout the entire system within five minutes or less'' accord=
ing to BOMA, which has advised its members to do all they can to make exter=
nal fresh air intakes less accessible.    While CECO recognizes that this i=
s an important first step, it believes the air ventilation systems themselv=
es must be protected. ``We can do this today. CECO has had technology for y=
ears, including filtering systems that capture airborne biological agents,'=
' says DeZwirek.    CECO has been involved with the chemical weapons destru=
ction program since its inception 15 years ago. Its filtering systems were =
engineered into incinerators where several thousand tons of Sarin and VX ne=
rve gas and blister agents have so far been destroyed, along with more than=
 half a million rockets, bombs, mortars and mines.    ``Our technology has =
successfully filtered all particles from the incineration process,'' says D=
eZwirek. CECO has more than three decades of experience dealing with indust=
rial air pollution. In addition, it has developed and deployed systems that=
 protect workers by successfully capturing deadly dust and poisonous gasses=
 that can be produced during the manufacturing process. Its clients include=
 numerous Fortune 100 companies including DuPont, Exxon and U.S. Steel. ``W=
e have always been in the business of saving lives,'' says DeZwirek. ``We h=
ave built a $100-million dollar business in protecting workers and the publ=
ic at large from the scourge of industrial pollutants. Now we are applying =
our vast knowledge and experience to an even more nefarious problem.'' CECO=
 has established an internal task force to outline and provide recommendati=
ons for immediately and affordably implementing technological solutions tha=
t will help keep Americans safe in the commercial workplace.    ``The milit=
ary has safely destroyed tons of deadly nerve gas with the help of CECO tec=
hnology,'' DeZwirek says. ``Similar filters and air ventilation and purific=
ation systems can and must be deployed to protect the American public.'' AB=

We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

Subject:	Holiday Party - Canceled


I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.
	2. SITARA #573532 should be Tiered Rate-Step:   5,000mmbtu/day @ $8.90
							10,000mmbtu/day @ $8.85

Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,
Doug  x3-0560

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560

This is a notification that the Enron Corp.

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill K=
ill Cult Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so s=
tarting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. H=
e'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid usin=
g him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's on=
ly scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New ! En! g=
land secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy =
team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL=
 - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy total=
s this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'=
ll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still =
worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , R=
B STL - oops, I did it again Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against=
 Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. =
He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 agai=
nst New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/=
01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team i=
s somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the leag=
ue, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no=
 choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - The Fat Bastards Updated 11=
/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisc=
o, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid star=
ting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - M=
eximullets Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last we=
ekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this seaso=
n, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake P=
it Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks,=
 but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some s=
uccess against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad fin=
ally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards again=
st St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponen=
t, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB -=
 The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Favre h! as! been one of the best Fantas=
y quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sun=
day with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. =
  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put=
 up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him=
 a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster,=
 Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bi=
ll Schroeder , WR GB - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankl=
e) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sund=
ay against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose seco=
ndary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Drough=
ns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time w=
ith Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's ab=
sence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and s=
tarting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart o=
n Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is o=
nly worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   Charlie Ba=
tch , QB DET - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/01 Batch will again lose playing =
time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will be the No. 2 QB again, but wil=
l see playing time as the Lions continue to use two quarterbacks. As a resu=
lt, you may want to look for another signal-caller to start on your Fantasy=
 team.    David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/01 Sloan is an=
 unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for minus-2 yard p=
erformance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Sloan=
 isn't advisable.   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/=
01 Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent wee=
ks. He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick=
 for Fantasy owners overall.   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Who's Yo Daddy Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Collins has been inconsisten! t ! this season, but the matchup=
 this week against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 3=
81 yards passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, =
and is worth taking a chance on in Week 10.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Thr=
ill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/01 Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy num=
bers in certain games this season, but he's been inconsistent overall. Howe=
ver, facing a porous Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth consider=
ing in larger Fantasy leagues.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nutwha=
ckers Updated 11/16/01 Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injure=
d ankle. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him t=
o be too reliable if he plays.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - oops, I did it aga=
in Updated 11/16/01 Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three =
games, so starting him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' seconda=
ry is questionable at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive.   Amani =
Toomer , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Toomer could find some =
real success on Monday night aga! in! st Minnesota. The Vikings sport one o=
f the worst secondaries in the league, so starting Toomer based on the matc=
hup is a wise move.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/0=
1 Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in Den=
ver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would=
 start in his place.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 1=
1/16/01 Bennett is expected to return to action after missing three game wi=
th a high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Doug Chapman on Mon=
day night against the Giants, making him a risky start on your Fantasy team=
.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/01 Pathon (foot) i=
s now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie Wayne should star=
t in his place.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 A=
lexander (ankle) did not practice on Thursday, and is doubtful for Sunday's=
 game against Denver. Willia! m ! Rasby and Zeron Flemister will likely spl=
it time at tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither player has any rea=
l Fantasy value.   Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Lineback=
er Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday against Denver. "W=
e wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective," Redskins Coach=
 Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. "I think he'll be effective=
." He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle a few weeks ago.   Tyro=
ne Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/16/01  Wheatley has strep th=
roat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now questionable for Sunday's =
game as he also makes his way back from a knee injury.   Eagles , DT PHI - =
One Man Show Updated 11/16/01 Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed practice on We=
dnesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to practice, how=
ever, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dallas.   Erron=

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Staying on Top of the Trends   ? Managing E-Reports   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]

Check the Fantasy News area throughout the week for news and advice from our experts.

    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

I have a couple of exciting things to tell you about.
First, my website is up and running.  Please take a moment to check it out.   The link is at the bottom of this letter.  Many thanks to Sarah Powell at Compose Digital Design for her work.
Second, be sure to watch "American Roots Music" beginning Oct. 29 at 10PM ET on PBS.  It is a 4-part series I had the pleasure to work on.  I was the Director of Photography and shot interviews and performances in San Antonio, Austin and Gruene, TX, Mardi Gras in south Louisiana and Gospel in New Orleans, blues music in Helena, Arkansas, the Mississippi Delta and Memphis, and country and bluegrass in Nashville.
Here is an excerpt from the press release about the show:
http://www.pbs.org/whatson/press/oct01/amer_roots.html
~~New York (September 24, 2001) -Filmed at locations such as the Cajun Mardi Gras in southwest Louisiana, the Lakota Reservation in South Dakota and the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee, the series captures the essence and storied history of early American song. The series will be the first to trace the evolution of Native American, country, blues, gospel, western swing, Cajun, zydeco and tejano music using archival footage interwoven with interviews, performances, recordings and photographs of contemporary musicians like Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Marc Savoy, Gillian Welch and Robbie Robertson that will re-create the journey of American roots music from the past to its present incarnations. 
Four part ?American Roots Music? Series to Air on PBS Beginning October 29, 2001 Palm Pictures to release companion 4 CD box set, DVD/VHS and ?Highlights? CD on Oct. 30th Comprehensive Companion Book by Harry N. Abrams Inc. In Stores Now~~
Of course, I've been busy with other projects for Discovery Health, Anheuser-Busch, ESPN, Fox Sports, 60 Minutes, Travel Channel, Food Network, HGTV and another PBS documentary, among others.

I think I will be visiting Rhett in Turkey this year for New Years. It is
a camoflouge theme and they will be serving MRE's buffet style. Rhett will
be the guest of honor since he is the oldest peice of shit still in the
gaurd! Let me know who is in!

Naquin

I am out for Chateau Porteous, I would rather have a terrible time like I
always do for New Years without the $250.00 plus tuxedo overhead.

ell Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from ar=
throscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surpr=
ise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fractur=
e in his leg and could be lost for the season.   "At this point in time, I'=
m on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said.   Davis admitted that his r=
ight knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout te=
am the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was=
 listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , W=
R NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer migh=
t be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevici=
us if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night again=
st the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coa=
ch Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.    =
 Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sun=
day's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described C=
hrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extra =
cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests a=
nd scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-=
old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past =
year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one ca=
tch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-=
evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert=
 Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the D=
etroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to he=
lp fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Eman=
uel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    H=
ines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an an=
kle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.  =
  Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions =
placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in =
his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeab=
le hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the=
 Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Frank Updat=
ed 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. Wit=
h Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time =
for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   E=
arly indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup.=
 But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the firs=
t team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on=
 Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated=
 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to sta=
rt in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexp=
erienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Mon=
itor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - H=
unter Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tu=
esday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. =
Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Benga=
ls worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporar=
ily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd=
 Pinkston  , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wri=
st but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day =
to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon=
 missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in hi=
s recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, r=
eturning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as =
a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 r=
eceiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and repl=
ace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius play=
ed alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on th=
e sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   S=
winton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday'=
s game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday an=
d did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be avail=
able," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will=
 get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Giggle=
s Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's gam=
e against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances o=
f playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some lim=
ited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoi=
nt that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said=
 head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Su=
nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury=
.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recov=
ering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is li=
sted as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free A=
gent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Hea=
d Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup =
as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cro=
ss that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if=
 I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he=
 got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspe=
ct that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room=
, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're=
 safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Tre=
nt Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to pr=
actice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to =
Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    =
Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be=
 the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, accord=
ing to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood=
 in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a ve=
ry favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't us=
e him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Th=
e Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caroli=
na. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussio=
n he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He=
 is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy p=
layer at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Up=
dated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He i=
s still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him t=
his week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs =
Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris =
Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use =
either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi=
ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome =
Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third stra=
ight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use h=
im this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  =
 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r=
ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terre=
ll Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Su=
nday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee=
 surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. =
He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda=
y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea=
gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and =
is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Ma=
tty Player News    Marshall Faulk  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  According =
to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against N=
ew Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Mart=
z said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's =
got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him pl=
ay." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unabl=
e to go.    J.J. Stokes  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  Stokes spent much o=
f the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completel=
y healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me=
 because I was able to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Cos=
ta Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm =
darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him =
as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.    Brian=
 Griese  , Reserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's =
game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing=
, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.    Terry Glenn =
 , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  According to published reports, Glenn has be=
en declared inactive for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. Glenn is deali=
ng with a hamstring injury that he sustained last week, and he is not yet 1=
00 percent.    Michael Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a=
 great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total off=
ense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regular=
ity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.    Frank Wych=
eck  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yar=
ds and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he rema=
ins a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at=
 wide receiver.    Michael Bennett  , Reserve RB Updated 10/21/01  Bennett =
has now been listed as inactive for Sunday's game against Green Bay. Doug C=
hapman will start at tailback for the Vikings in his absence.    Rod Smith =
 , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Smith should have another fine game this wee=
k. He will be the focal point of the Denver passing game in a contest that =
will feature a lot of offense.    Aaron Brooks  , Active QB Updated 10/18/0=
1  This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks =
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against t=
he pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor.    Joe Horn  , Active WR=
 Updated 10/18/01  Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The F=
alcons' secondary is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble puttin=
g up solid Fantasy numbers.    Giants  , Active DT Updated 10/17/01  Defens=
ive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's gam=
e against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against Phi=
ladelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able to =
play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a sprai=
ned ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this point.=
    Brad Johnson  , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01  Johnson finally had a prod=
uctive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards and three scores against T=

we might need to hit his parents up for some of those, this may sound gay,
but I'll bet they would like it, we could give it to them as a present, a
video slide show of Max and Jen growing up and meeting.  Their parents might
already be doing this but they did it at Josh and Lisa's (cousin) wedding
and it was cool.

tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/=
21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptio=

not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Wh=
o's Yo Daddy Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 =
yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for t=
he most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it=
 tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updated 10/21/01 G=
reen threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Gre=
en has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a sta=
rting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/21/=
01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbe=
rs were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been =
so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett can=
not stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat=
 Bastards Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posti=
ng seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the =
best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic=
hael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great ou=
ting on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and =
a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but =
he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD =
- oops, I did it again Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego o=
n Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver=
. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's cert=
ainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Executioners=
 Updated! 1! 0/21/01 Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this se=
ason by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on t=
he day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desm=
ond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Su=
nday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's =
been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so contin=
ue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Nice Machi=
ne Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st! ar! ted Sunday's game against San=
 Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown an=
d two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The =
Executioners Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards agai=
nst Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, b=
ecause he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Who's=
 Yo Daddy Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 car=
ries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performanc=
e very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - One Man Show Updated 10/21/01 Ter=
rell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robin=
son injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago pas=
sing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/21/=
01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establi=
shing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured bac=
k for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nutwhacker=
s Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes fo! r ! 100 yards and a TD a=
t Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-not=
ch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receive=
r.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Guzzlers Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for=
 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batc=
h has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fa=
ntasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD =
and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, =

21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saint=
s. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect =
good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New =
Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder=
 of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - The Executioners Updated 10/21/01 C=
onnell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitel=
y time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - T=
he Fat Bastards Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving ya=
rds on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against t! he! lo=
w-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owne=
rs with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Up=
dated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. =
Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy=
 appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score =
in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/21/01 Dunn play=
ed despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was =
limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthon=
y Becht  , TE NYJ - The Nice Machine Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game=
 against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's =
been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numb=
ers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keysh=
awn Johnson , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 pass=
es for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relat=
ionship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post h=
igh-quality numbers on a regular basis.  ! Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Who's Y=
o Daddy Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries=
 against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves=
 Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB =
STL - The Executioners Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against th=
e New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His rol=
e as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the =
health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Nice Machi=
ne Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches =
for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Mich=

Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

cjrob

   If a dog were your teacher, you would learn stuff like: 
   When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. 
   Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride. 
   Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy. 
   When it's in your best interest, practice obedience. 
   Let others know when they've invaded your territory. 
   Take naps. Stretch before rising. 
   Run, romp, and play daily. 
   Thrive on attention and let people touch you. 
   Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. 
   On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass. 
   On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree. 
   When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body. 
   No matter how often you're scolded, don't buy into the guilt thing 
   and pout ... run right back and make friends. 
   Delight in the simple joy of a long walk. 
   Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. Stop when you have had enough. 
   Be loyal. 
   Never pretend to be something you're not. 
   If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it. 
   When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle 
   them gently. 
   And finally, never trust anyone until you sniff their butt

Matt,
To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.
DAS
 
P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure how I feel about that.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Melba,

I have made all of the changes with the exception of adding the following:

Aquila Risk Management Corp - Not approved for Physical trading
PG&E Core - Not EOL counterparty
TransCanada Gas Service - need clarification TransCanada Gas Services Inc. or TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.

Thanks,
Stephanie

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Every thing is good here. Tom and I played golf yesterday at Fox Hollow,
beautiful day, unfortunately can't say the same for our golf game.

Enron is sure in the press. Seems like your hotdog McKinnsey ex-president
and CFO are much more adept at accounting sleights of hand than actually
running the company.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thu=
rsday against Dallas, but we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy sta=
ts. The Cowboys will probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and M=
ike Anderson risky starts this week since they have been splitting time.  B=
rian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 11/21/01 With favorite target Rod Smith=
 likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to wor=
k w! it! h Thursday against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will prob=
ably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He sho=
uld provide your team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Mars=
hall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage y=
ards and a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player=
 in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Jamel Whi=
te , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Browns may use White as a cha=
nge-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense. You might w=
ant to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you're l=
acking in starting options.  Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11=
/21/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy te=
am is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the =
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will hav=
e no choice but to do.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/21/01 Warne=
r had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards =
and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will thr=
ow at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   O.=
J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Santiago catches the occ=
asional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then. =
He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one=
 of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a t=
ight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.  Kevin Johnson  ,=
 WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson has been a prime target for Tim=
 Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliabl=
e No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a go=
od career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get hi=
m into your lineup.  Tim Couch , QB CLE - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Couch has =
a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), wh=
om he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could ch=
oose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week, give him a lo=
ok.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Warrick has been ca=
tching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't provided stats worth=
y of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league. His matchup against C=
leveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.  Darnay =
Scott , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Although Scott has caught a to=
uchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he play=
s Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inc=
onsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.  Jon Kitna =
, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 We can't advise you use Kitna as he =
goes up against the Browns' secondary this week. Cleveland has been very st=
ingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ran=
king ninth overall in sacks.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up agains=
t the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678=
 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in yo=
ur active lineup week in and week ! ou! t in any league.  Larry Centers , R=
B BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Centers has been a great pass-catching =
back for the Bills this season, but he will face a Miami defense on Sunday =
that will likely be able to contain him. Only use him if you have no other =
alternative on your bench.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recen=
t weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a =
bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reservin=
g him.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/01 There's a good=
 chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Mi=
ami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the=
 Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history a=
gainst the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth usi=
ng as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.  Eric Johnson , TE SF - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/21/01 Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend again=
st Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't real=
ly worth starting at this point.    J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Update=
d 11/21/01 Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for =
72 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable ove=
rall, however, so starting him is still a risky move.   Travis Henry , RB B=
UF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Henry had a very disappointing game agains=
t the Seahawks in Week 10, and will likely struggle again against the far-b=
etter Dolphins defense on Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit=
 using this week.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Van=
 Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a strong D=
olphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawk=
s, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week d=
espite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the bench fo=
r Week 11.  ! Travis Taylor , WR BAL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/01 Afte=
r a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self. We d=
on't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so don't us=
e him this week.  Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Sharpe h=
as been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdo=
wn on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville,=
 and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe into your acti=
ve lineup every week.  Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01Is=
mail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly devel=
oping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot strea=
k and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get =
Ismail into your starting lineup this week. Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/21/01 Buckhalter will return from suspension this week=
end, and will be available for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Stale=
y has established himself as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhal=
ter is a gamble.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Stale=
y had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in Philadelp=
hia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes him worth =
starting in Week 11 against Washington.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/21/01 Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two c=
atches for 17 yards like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will st=
ill be in the starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gambl=
e nonetheless.   Ron Dayne  , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/21/01 Dayne=
 has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He m=
ay score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fan=
tasy owners overall.      Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/21/01 =
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a touchd=
own in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run this seas=
on, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their offense in We=

 continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a sore toe. H=
e may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary, however, es=
pecially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play.   Amani Toomer , WR =
NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards aga=
inst Minnesota on Monday night, but he'll struggle to post similar numbers =
vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in=
 smaller Fantasy leagues is a wise move.   More Updates   Teams, Rosters  [=
