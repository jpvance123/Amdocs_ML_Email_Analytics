Sir,
 For the month of August, 2000, we will take 50% of our open Block Forward 
position financial instead of physical. We would like to make this change 
because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us 
commercially. Thus for bona fide commercial reasons, we will go financial 
with 50% of our open Block Forward position.

I somehow created two of the same files that are linked, and I cannot unlink 
them. The files are xxx4:1 and xxx4:2. I have tried closing the iles and 
closing excel, but when I re-open xxx4, both the files are re-opened. This is 
a very important file, so I need help as soon as possible. Thank you.

Craig Rose's article includes the price we offered to SDG&E -- thanks to 
Peace.  He makes us look like the bad guys in some respects -- at least he's 
saying let's try to make the market work first -- before asking the CPUC for 
price caps.

The first flavor of Peace response to Enron's offer to SDG&E is in the
attached SDG&E article.  Brace yourself.  Other articles are also of

This guy looks like he would be great on the services desk. But he says he is 
looking for a position with a company with that is a "progressive generation 
owner" in the WSCC, we don't fit that mold. It might be a waste of time if we 
don't have what he's looking for.

 Your child like attempts to use the English language at anything above the 
third grade level is indeed laughable. Not only do you babble, you're 
spelling is atrocious. Hope your trip is going well.

 *DJ Calif. PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX

 Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For Utilities

 LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission
approved a controversial plan Thursday morning that
 will allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outside
the Caliifornia Power Exchange market structure.

 The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners Henry
Duque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeper voted
 in favor of the draft order.

 The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energy
unit San Diego Gas & Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &
 Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison
(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that
 became effective in March 1998 when the state moved to a deregulated
competitive market. Originally the mandatory buy
 requirement was set to end in 2002, when all three utilities recovered
their stranded costs.

 "This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds," Commissioner
Bilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said at
 Thursday's meeting. "I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this will
result in lower prices patched through to bundled
 customers."

 Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York Mercantile
Exchange can now compete directly with the
 CalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.
The utilities can buy power from other "qualified
 exchanges" through an advice letter process.

 Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now

 California's big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX market
structure immediately, through an advice letter process,
 which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent to
trade power with qualified exchanges such as APX,
 Nymex or Bloomberg.

 The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as the
CalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, and
 anonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - in
order to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange.

 Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.
Enron Online would not meet the criteria for a
 qualified exchange, commissioners said.

 The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality that
would not need to be approved by a majority of the
 commission.

 Mark Huffman, PG&E senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told Dow Jones
Newswires that his company "will quickly start
 looking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to start
the advice letter process."

 SoCal Edison and SDG&E said they will do the same.

 Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversial
three-to-two vote in favor of the draft order "creates a
 tremendous opportunity for APX."

 "It allows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Valley technology to
California," Cazalet said. "This is really about bringing
 e-commerce to the market."

 E. Jesus Arredondo, however, disagreed, saying "selling into our market
doesn't cost anything and selling into the APX market
 costs 20 cents per megawatt-hour."

 Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lower
electricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and seller
 the chance to see prices before making the purchase.

 CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, Commissioner
Bilas said.

 Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer George Sladoje said
"Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor of
 accelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is not
well-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive."

Bob:

I cannot make this stuff up.  Steve Peace, the Senator famous for his
fight to protect the California Rate Payers, came to fame as the writer
of the Critically aclaimed film, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.  I
didn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with his
link attached to it.

http://www.lexingtonnet.com/tomatoes/creators/index.htm


title.gif (1905 bytes)

This page is dedicated to the three demented geniuses who brought us the 
Killer Tomatoes films!

?

John DeBello - Director/Writer

John DeBello was the director of all four Killer Tomatoes films. He also 
played small roles in each film, even playing himself in a few! He still runs 
many parts of Four Square Productions, I'm told.

?

Steve Peace - Writer/Actor

Steve Peace is probably best known in the KT films as Wilbur, the dim-witted, 
parachute-wearing leader of the Killer Tomatoes Task force. He also wrote 
parts of the films as well. Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own 
page at http://www.stevepeace.net

?

Costa Dillon - Writer

Last, but definitley not least is Costa Dillon. He's responsible for the 
entire concept of Killer Tomatoes! Like everyone else here, he played small 
parts throughout the films. Probably his best known was the kid in the 
library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying 
"Tomato!". This little part was later used as a major character in the 
cartoon series.

Listened in this afternoon. Essentially this is the capacity market that was 
discussed at the meeting I went to last week. Nothing solved or implemented, 
lots of arguments and whining.

=DJ Calif Generators: `We Welcome Probe Into Power Market'  (This article
was originally published Tuesday)       By Jason Leopold     OF DOW JONES
NEWSWIRES    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--When California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer completes his investigation into possible "collusion" in the
wholesale electricity market by generators, energy companies say he will
probably find the same thing Geraldo Rivera found in Al Capone's safe:
nothing.  Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they
welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
"We have done nothing wrong at all," said Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke
Energy North America (DUK). "Our plants have been running all summer long.
Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new
generation and then try and rig the market."  For the past two months,
utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations
that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for
the price spikes.  Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.
State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings
of which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by the end of the year.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There
isn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,
director of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.
"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for
power," Borenstein said. "Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the
commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  "I
would say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high
prices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There
is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... ."
The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as a
consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay
market-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by
utility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passed
on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.
Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own
investigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also says
that an investigation "will turn up nothing."  So why conduct one?  "This is
a very politically charged issue," Bergstrom said. "When something goes
wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at."  A source in the
governor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer's
investigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis "has a responsibility to
his constituents."  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up
is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough
power plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,
chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System
Operator.  Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with
the way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works
well.  "Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)
knowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that as
market power abuse," Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,
such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E
customers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) all
still plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance
than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price
cap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  "At the end of the day the market
is short power and you got to get people to build new generation," said
Dynegy's Bergstrom. "We got a big investment in California. We're not
walking away from that."  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;

12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'
Complaint
(This article was originally published Tuesday)
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California's power grid administrator Monday urged
federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking
compensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed
during an extreme power grid emergency.
The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a
"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,
and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely."
The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already
allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the
power producers' complaint as "a collateral attack" on a previous FERC order
rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.
Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort
measure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.
The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of
interruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.
The ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution
utilities and California regulators.
They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from
under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in
skyrocketing power prices this summer.
The generators "knew when they purchased California power plants and when
they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their
schedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even
more expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain grid
reliability in California is irresponsible," said Southern California
Edison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).
"The complaint is a sham," declared the California Public Utilities
Commission.
"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps by
making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and
sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'
market power," the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject the
complaint.
"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of
conduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,
and seeks to avoid the price cap," the PUC said.
But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the
complaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy Power
Marketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).
"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price
of $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISO
would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market
participants who schedule energy for export," said the Electric Power Supply
Association, the national trade group representing competitive power
producers.
"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the
curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,"
said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,
it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur
more frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and more
energy will leave California in search of higher prices," said Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual
damages and lost opportunity costs.
At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as
well.
"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the
transactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full
costs of doing so," said the Northern California Power Agency.

I somehow created 2 of the same file that it linked together. The 2 new files 
are xxx4:1 and xxx4:2. I dont know how I created this, but I have tried 
closing the file, exiting excel, but when I re-open the file, both of them 
open. This is a very important file so I need help as soon as possible. Thank 
you.

MARKET NOTICE---EMERGENCY OPERATING ORDER RELATING TO UNINSTRUCTED
DEVIATIONS JULY 31, 2000

This notice is to advise all Scheduling Coordinators and owners of
Generation in the ISO Control Area that the ISO is issuing an operating
order for July 31, 2000, that all resources must follow final Hour Ahead
Schedules, as adjusted by RMR Dispatch Notices, or by Dispatch instructions
verbal or electronic, on Ancillary Service or Supplemental Energy bids.  NO
UNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED.  Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ISO
Tariff requires Market Participants in the ISO Control Area to "comply fully
and promptly with the ISO's operating orders." Any Generating Unit with real
time output that reflects an excessive deviation from the real time output
consistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by Dispatch
instructions, and assuming a 20 minute ramp across the top of the hour for
hourly Schedule changes, will be deemed to have failed to comply with this
operating order.  For the purpose of this determination, an excessive
deviation shall be the smaller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximum
capability, or 10 MW.  The only exception to this finding is a Generating
Unit that provides the ISO with timely notification of a unit outage or
derate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliable
operation of the ISO Control Area.  In particular, uninstructed incremental
deviations by Generating Units that are "chasing" the BEEP Interval Prices
published by the ISO are directly responsible for the frequency excursions
the ISO experienced  June 13, 2000. The ISO will take the following actions
with respect to those Generating Units that fail to comply with this
Operating Order: 1) ISO Management will deliver a report to the ISO
Governing Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of the
instructed and actual output profile for each Generating Unit that fails to
comply. 2) The ISO will assign any WSCC RMS penalties associated with
frequency deviations to the Generating Units that fail to comply.

Jeff,
 Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. 
As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant
