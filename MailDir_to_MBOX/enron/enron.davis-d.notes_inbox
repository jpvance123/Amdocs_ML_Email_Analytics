Subject: Fwd[2]:GREAT STORY:SHAKE & STEP


This is a great story so I hope you'll take the time to read it when you
can.
However, I disagree with the coupling it with our faith in Jesus.  My
friends it
begins with our faith in Jesus.

That should not be a problem.  Rufino said he can cover for you.  You may ask 
if you can cover for him for part of the morning since he gets here early.

Good Morning Marnie -

Yesterday I made a dental appt. for Monday, Dec. 11th @ 5pm but I need to 
leave at 4pm to get there on time.  I have to finish a root canal that was 
started several months ago.  Do you foresee a problem with me leaving at 4pm 
that day?

For those of you who are thinking about contributing, I would like to suggest 
we get each of the managers a Leeds Benchmark Durahyde Zippered Padfolio 
($15) for each .  If everyone participated, it would be less than $5 each.  
They are nice and we can get them from the Signature Shop.  Let me know what 
you think.

-----Original Message----- 


" To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages but this is 
from my 
good friend Sheila Coleman Bantz, (She is our Soiree Queen)." 

She received this message from her friend Pearlas Sanborn who is an 
attorney.....If she says that this will work - it WILL work. After all, 
what have you got to loose? 

Anna V 

SORRY EVERYBODY.....JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! 

I'm an attorney, and I know the law. This thing is for real. 
Rest assured AOL and Intel will follow through with their promises for 
fear of facing a multimillion dollar class action suit similar to the 
one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric not too long ago. 

We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta test without 
getting 
a little something for our time. 

My brother's girlfriend got in on this a few months ago. When I went to 
visit him for the Baylor!/UT game. She showed me her check. It was for 
the sum of $4,324.44 and was stamped "Paid In Full". Like I said before, 
I know the law, and this is for 
real. 

If you don't believe me you can email her at ( jpiltman@baylor.edu .) 
She's eager to answer any questions you guys might have. 

Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them 
the largest Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL 
remains the most widely used program, Intel and AOL are running an 
e-mail 
beta test. 

When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will 
track it(if you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two week time 
period. 


For every person that you forward this e-mail to, 
Microsoft will pay you $203.15. 

For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, 
Microsoft will pay you $156.29 

and for every third person that receives it, 
you will be paid $17.65. 

Within two weeks, Intel will contact you for your address and then 
send you a check. I thought this was a scam myself, but a 
friend of my good friend's Aunt Patricia, who works at Intel actually 
got 
a check of 
$4,543.23 by forwarding this e-mail. 


Try it, what have you got to lose????

Hold off on pulling together this information.  I need to have several 
clarifying questions answered by AA and also to sit down with Dana tomorrow 
to see if she can help me with most of the exercise.  I will need all of you

Friends who Pray together, stay together. Let's pray...

Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I Thank You for my being able to see
and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing
me.

Forgive me this day for I have sinned. I ask now for Your forgiveness.
Keep me safe from all danger and harm. Let me start this day with a new
attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every
day and give my best in all that is put before me.

Clear my mind that I can hear from You. Broaden my mind that I can accept
all things. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.

Let me continue to see sin through Your eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and
receive the forgiveness of God and sin no more.

And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example - to
slipaway and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm
pushed
beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart.
Continue to use me to do Thy Will. Continue to bless me that I may be a
blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak and unsaved.

Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. pray
for those who are lost and can't find their way. I pray for those who are
misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who refuse to share a word
from You. I pray for those who don't know You intimately.
I pray for those who will only read this and not speak this aloud in their
own lives. I pray for those who will delete this without sharing it with
others. I pray for those who don't believe. But, I thank you that I believe.

I believe that God changes people and God changes things.
I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member
in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes, that
they are out of debt and all their needs are met. There are no
circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in His hands
for Him to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of
every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.

This is my prayer. In Jesus Name, Amen.

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=

scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=

I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

 The holidays are fast approaching and rather than the customary floor pot 
luck, someone came up with the idea of consecutive days of baked goods  (i.e. 
cookies, cakes, candy, etc.) strategically placed all over the floor.  

 The goodie days will be December 12, 13 and 14th!

 If you would like to participate, please send your admin an e-mail that 
includes what you would like to bring!!!   We can go back to our diets in 
January!!!

This year we will be having our Christmas Dinner at the Cadillac Bar & 
Grill.  We have reserved the back room for our group.  Everyone will need to 
provide their own transportation because........ we aren't coming back to 
work that day!  We should try to leave around 2:00pm to be there by 2:30pm.  
We will also be having a "White Elephant" gift exchange.  If you choose to 
buy a present, $10.00 is the limit you should spend or you can bring an item 
from home, just make sure that the items are gift-wrapped.  For those that 
have never participated in a "White Elephant" gift exchange, I will be 
forwarding the rules on Monday.  I also have a copy of the menu at my desk if 
anyone would like to see it.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nicole

RE: WALMART - CORPORATE MORAL STANCE


Okay, folks, let's put our mouth where our money is . . .  I am not sure
about the rest of you, but I feel like my family single-handedly keeps
Wal-Mart in business!   This is truly a courageous company and they
deserve our very vocal support at this time.  - Sandy Zeek

Subject:  THE VALUE OF MONEY...


Money can buy a house, but not a home.
Money can buy a bed, but not sleep.
Money can buy a clock, but not time.
Money can buy a book, but not knowledge.
Money can buy food, but not an appetite.
Money can buy position, but not respect.
Money can buy blood, but not life.
Money can buy medicine, but not health.
Money can buy sex, but not love.
Money can buy insurance, but not safety.
You see, money is not everything.

"When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles'
hands, he offered them money and said, "Give me also this ability so that
everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."  Peter
answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could
buy the gift of God with money!  You have no part or share in this
ministry, because your heart is not right before God."
Acts 8:18-21 NIV

WHY JESUS IS BETTER THAN SANTA CLAUS

Santa lives at the North Pole...
JESUS is everywhere
Santa rides in a sleigh...
JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the water.
Santa fills your stockings with goodies...
JESUS supplies all your needs.
You have to wait in line to see Santa...
JESUS is as close as the mention of HIS name.
Santa lets you sit on his lap...
JESUS lets you rest in HIS arms.
Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly...
JESUS has a heart full of love.
All Santa can offer is ho,ho,ho...
JESUS offers HELP, HEALTH, AND HOPE.
Santa says, "You better not cry..."
JESUS says,"Cast all your cares on me for I care for you."
Santa's little helpers make toys...
JESUS makes new lives, mends wounded hearts, repairs broken homes, and
builds mansions.
Santa may make you chuckle but...
JESUS gives you joy that is your strength.
While Santa puts gifts under your tree...
JESUS became our gift and died on a tree.
Remember, to keep CHRIST in CHRISTmas...
JESUS is the reason for the season.

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

?? Right now, you're 3 for 5 on forgetting and always the same response.
Doing better next time.
I'm sitting here wondering at the age of 35 what makes ME happy. Do I really
know? What can I do to find out. What about those those things that do not
make me happy? The only thing to say in with you in mind. Is. You've managed
to be at both ends of the spectrum and not all by yourself. What I'm getting
at is. . . The only time(s) I've experienced periods of pain (with one
exception) with you is when you're involved with ANOTHER MAN. . . . . . . .
PREOCCUPIED on your part. That was someone more important to you, and was
that way for awhile. Now recent developments have occurred that's telling my
heart that history my be repeating itself. I know what you've told me, but
it seems all too familiar. Hey, this is me. Do what you want and who you
want to. I know that sounds familiar. You said, that things at Work and Home
have you mentally preoccupied. What's different from the first 2 times you
remembered and then with the last 3 times you forgot? Coincidence?  We both
know that Kevin will always be that Lazy/Self-Centered/Spoiled Brat of an
A##Hole, until he wants to do something for HIMSELF. As for work. You got it
good. I understand about that Childish-boy you call a Co-worker. And
everything associated with that mess. I could very easily use that same
excuse you did about forgetting anything. Have I ever forgotten you on
anything, regardless of what was going? ? ? Well. . . I'm waiting. ? ? ?
Sometimes I think I should be more of a Self-Centered/High Strung A##hole
and look out for myself. Maybe I wouldn't feel the I do about a lot of
things. But then again, Back to what's real. We're not Married, just
friends. At least, when I was reminded of that last week. Do whom that makes
you happy. You're a grown woman.
Well, I'll be here for you to tell me how wrong I am about everthing that
I've said. And I want you to do it with both barrels.

P.S.
I thought Birthdays other than Valentines Day and X-mas was a day that you
can show that special person how special they are to you. That must have
something I read in a Far Side cartoon clip or fiction novel somewhere.
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

I can't undo what didn't do or did but,  if you will allow me to apologize
for being preoccupied and self-centered I will make it my business never to
forget your birthday again.

There will be 3 vans downstairs on Thursday, Dec. 14 that will be 
transporting sponsors every 15-20 minutes starting at 10am.  We should try to 
be there at least 30 minues before our 1st break (11:39), so let's try to 
leave around 11am-ish?

-------I walked into the grocery store not ?particularly interested 
in  
buying 
groceries. ?I ?wasn't hungry. ?The pain of losing my husband of 37 years 
was 
still too raw. ?And this ?grocery store held so many sweet memories. 

?Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd ?pretend to go off 
and 

look ??for something special. ?I knew what he was up to. ?I'd always spot 
him ?walking down the aisle with ??the three yellow roses in his hands. 
Rudy 
knew I ?loved yellow roses. ?With ?a ??heart filled with grief, I ?only 
wanted to buy my ?few items and leave, but ?even grocery shopping 
was ?different since Rudy had passed on. ?Shopping for one took time, a 
little ?more thought than it had ?for two. 

Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and 
remembered 
how Rudy had loved his steak. 

Suddenly a woman came beside me. ?She was blond, slim and lovely in a 
soft 

green pantsuit. ?I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bones, 
dropped 
them in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. ?She ?turned to go 
and ?once again reached for the pack of steaks. 

She saw me watching her and she smiled. ?"My husband loves T-bones, but 
honestly, at these prices, I don't know." 

I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her ?pale blue eyes. ?"My 
husband passed away eight days ago," I told her. ?Glancing at the package 
in 
her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice. ?"Buy him the 
steaks. ??And cherish every moment you have together." 

She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the 
package in her basket and wheeled away. 

I turned and pushed my cart across the length of ?the store to the dairy 
products. ?There I stood, trying to decide which ?size milk I should buy. 
A 

quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near ?the 
front ?of the store. ?If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ?ice 
cream cone. 

I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down ?the aisle toward the 
front. 

I saw first the green suit, then recognized the ?pretty lady coming 
towards 
?me. ?In her arms she carried a package. ?On her ?face was the  
brightest 
smile ?I had ever seen. ?I would swear a soft halo encircled her ?blond 
hair 

as she ?kept walking toward me, her eyes holding mine. ?As she ?came 
closer, 

I saw ??what she held and tears began misting in my eyes. 

"These are for you," she said and placed three ?beautiful long stemmed 
yellow ?roses in my arms. ?"When you go through the line, ?they will know 
these are ??paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle ?kiss on my 
cheek, then smiled ?again. 

I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the ?roses meant, but still 
unable ?to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my 
vision. 
I 
looked ?down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green ?tissue  
wrapping 
and found ?it ??almost unreal. ?How did she know? ?Suddenly the ?answer 
seemed so clear. ?I ?wasn't alone. 

?"Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you? ?I ?whispered, with 
tears 
in ?my ??eyes. ?He was still with me, and she was his angel. 

?Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you ?are. ?Please read 
all 

of this, it is really nice. This is a simple request. ?If ?you appreciate 
life, send this to your friends, ?including the person that ?sent it to 
you. 
Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the ?alarm ?rings,thank 
you, 

Lord, that I can hear. ?There are many who are deaf. ?Even though I keep 
my 

eyes closed against ?the ?morning light as long as ?possible, thank you, 
Lord, that I can see. ?Many are blind. 

?Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, ?thank you, Lord, 
that 

I ??have the strength to rise. ??There are many who are bedridden. 

?Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are lost, 
toast 
is ??burned and tempers are short, my children are so ?loud, thank ?you, 
Lord, for ?my family. ?There are many who are lonely. ?Even though our 
breakfast table never looks like ?the pictures in ?magazines ??and the 
menu 
is at times unbalanced, thank ?you,Lord, for the ?food we have. ??There 
are 
many who are hungry. ?Even though the routine of ?my job often is 
monotonous, thank you, Lord, for ?the opportunity to ?work. ?There are 
many 
who have no job. ??Even though I grumble and bemoan ?my fate from day ?to 
day 
and wish my ??circumstances were not so modest, ?thank you, Lord, ?for 
life. 

Pass this on to the friends you know, it ?might ?help a bit to make this 
world ?a better place to live, right? 

PASS IT ON.... 
See ya later,

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Remember to check any entries you may have with a posting date of 11/1/00 or 
later and to accounts 60000000-79999999 to make sure you replace the profit 
center with a cost center as discussed below.  If you need to set up a cost 
center you will need to request it through lotus notes.  

Double-check your entries before you have them keyed in case they do need a 
cost center but are not kick out when keyed.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Re: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)  

Per Stacy Aune concerning this issue, her understanding is that a manual 
entry will be kicked out unless a cost center is entered for applicable 
accounts.  If you have entries to accounts 60000000-79999999 you should 
replace the profit center with a cost center for entries with a posting date 
on or after 11/1/00.  Most profit centers have one or more related cost 
centers assigned to them per the Standard Hierarchy Report but some do not.  
If your chosen profit center does not have a related cost center let me 
know.    

Keep in mind that this is only for accts. 60000000-79999999 and most of those 
accounts are not used by our group.  However, we do use some of the accounts 
such as 62000000 Interest Income - Third Party, among others.  

Cost Centers are only needed for these accounts for entries with a posting 
date of 11/1/00 or later.  If you are doing 10/31/00 close entries, do them 
the same as you have been.

Since we are in the middle of 10/00 close and this issue does not affect 
10/31/00 entries, I will remind everyone in November to review this issue for 
their entries.  Let me know if you have any questions.  

Kevin

Kevin,
 Can you please coordinate this by Friday, November 10th.  We should have 
profit centers set up for all of our companies, but I am not sure about cost 
centers.  Please refer to the Standard Hierarchy Report.   Let me know if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

As most of you may already know, beginning November 1st  (Sorry, we got this 
Friday afternoon!), the 60000000-79999999 range of accounts will now require 
a cost center instead of a profit center when using those accounts.  Some of 
the accounts that this range includes is Interest Income/Expense, Gain/Loss 
on Foreign Currency, and Gain/Losses on Disposition of Assets.

Unfortunately, the processes that are run automatically by the ISC that 
eventually book to these accounts, will hit a default cost center on each 
company if one is not specified.  This is very similar to the derivation 
pooling profit center 12951.  The ISC is giving us the opportunity to specify 
by company/account what the default cost center should be for each account.

Please review the attached spreadsheet below.  It contains a row for each 
company and shows the default cost center the ISC has chosen for each account.
 

Please respond back to me with the following:

1)  Confirmation that you have reviewed and agree with the cost center that 
has been chosen for each account on your company

    -OR-

2)  An attachment with the changes you desire the ISC to make with regards to 
your default cost center by account

These changes will affect any posting date of November 1st or later.  For 
those of you who have FX revalution on your companies, this change will have 
an effect in October close when the FX program is run after the last workday.

I need a response from those companies with FX revalution ASAP.

For the remainder of the companies, I would like a response by Friday, 
November 10th.

Thanks for your efforts in advance and sorry for the short notice,

Stacey

Subject: Spreadsheet for Review - New Cost Elements (60000000-79999999)

I promise this is the last note about this today.

The attached spreadsheet has all the default cost centers we have loaded in 
the system for the accounts listed below.  We  have made an initial attempt 
to do this for you.    It is not required to use the same default cost center 
for each of these accounts on a company code.  Previously when these defaults 
were assigned at the profit center level, you were only allowed one default 
profit center for a company code.  We are not encouraging multiple default 
cost centers for these accounts, but we just want to offer the flexibility.

Please review the attached file, and forward me any changes you would like 
made.  You may only need to review the fields in yellow & green.  I have 
already sent you a note regarding the "No CC" fields that are in red.   We 
are only entering the default cost centers for the accounts that had activity 
on your company codes in year 2000.  That is why there are a lot of empty 
fields you do not have to worry about.   We will continue to add and modify 
the cost center defaults on an as needed basis.

Use this information to help you analyze the spreadsheet:
Accounts in black The accounts in black were already cost elements and 
already had the default cost centers assigned.  
Accounts in blue- The accounts in blue are the new cost elements.  If there 
was an existing default cost center for a company, we have already assigned 
it to    the new accounts in blue.  

Yellow  We selected a default cost center from the values assigned to  the 
default profit center for that company code.
Green  There was not a default profit center so we reviewed the cost centers 
on that company and selected the one we thought was most appropriate.
Red  This company code did not have any cost centers.  I have already asked 
you for these in a previous email. 



If you make changes, please move them to a spreadsheet by themselves or make 
them easy for us to identify in this spreadsheet.   Thanks again for all your 
help.  

Accounts posted to automatically by the system



* Already a cost element before this new process.

Subject: Re: Pancakes


Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to "make pancakes," for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20

ve=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al=

e=20
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the=
=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20
continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look=
=20
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=
=20
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Thank you so much for taking the initiative to pray for me. God bless you and 
your prayer warriors. I am a strong believer and I have put all of my trust 
in God. I would like to also share with you that a friend of mine had to have 
one of her breast removed on last week and I know it was a test of her faith. 
She does nothing but minister to  everyone through prayer, words of 
encouragement;  and now this has happened to her to trust and be challenged 
in her faith. I do believe I will be okay and I also believe you heard my cry 
for a reason. I do need your prayers and everyone else's. I do need your 
prayers so that I can be at peace.
Thank you so much for caring. I will definitely keep you posted between now 
and next Thursday December 21st when I go in for my Ultra Sound.

Your friend in Christ,
Davette

Subject: prayer


	

Davette, 
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter 
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at 
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of 
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage 
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the 
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly 
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and 
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try 
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have 
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, 
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really 
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us 
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt 
we hurt. : )


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

Subject:  Brain Teaser


Hey:

We get these newsletters in our apartments every month and there is
always a
brain teaser on the back side of it.  This was the one for this month:

Let's see how well you will do.

For every question, tell me who this person is, not their names, but
their
relationship to you. (eg. cousin, aunt, great-grandma, etc.)


1.  Who is your father's, uncle's, brother's sister?

2.  Who is your aunt's mother's, father's, wife?

3.  Who is your mother's, nephew's, daughter's son?

4.  Who is your brother's, son's, sister's mother?

5.  Who is your sister-in-law's, father-in-law's grandson?

6.  Who is your sister's, father's, step-son's mother?

7.  Who is your uncle's, father's, grandchild?

Make an honest attempt, and then scroll down for the answers...

>   Here is a true story about a nine-year-old boy who lived in a rural town
>   in Tennessee.  His house was in a poor area of the community.  A church
>   had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday
afternoon.
>
>   The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus
pastor
>   asked if his parents were home and the small boy told him that his
parents
>   take off every weekend and leave him at home to take care of his little
>   brother.
>
>   The bus pastor couldn't believe what the kid said and asked him to
repeat
>  it.
>   The youngster gave the same answer and the bus pastor asked to come in
and
>   talk with him.   They went into the living room and sat down on an old
>  couch
>   with the foam and springs exposed.
>
>   The bus pastor asked the kid, "Where do you go to church?"
>
>   The young boy surprised the visitor by replying, "I've never been to
church
>
>   in my whole life."
>
>   The bus pastor thought to himself about the fact that his church was
less
>   than three miles from the child's house.  "Are you sure you have never
>   been to church?" he asked again.
>
>   "I sure haven't", came his answer.
>
>   Then the bus pastor said, "Well, son, more important than going to
>   church, have you ever heard the greatest love story ever told? "And then
he
>
>   proceeded to share the Gospel with this little nine-year-old boy.
>
>   The young lad's heart began to be tenderized and at the end of the bus
>  pastor's
>   story the bus pastor asked if the boy wanted to receive this free gift
from
>  God.
>   The youngster exclaimed, "You Bet!
>
>   The kid and the bus pastor got on their knees and the lad invited Jesus
>  into
>   his little heart and received the free gift of salvation.   They both
stood
>  up
>   and the bus pastor asked if he could pick the kid up for church the next
>  morning.
>
>   Sure," the nine year old replied.
>
>   The bus pastor got to the house early the next morning and found the
lights
>  off.
>   He let himself in and snaked his way through the house and found the
little
>  boy
>   asleep in his bed.  He woke up the little boy and his brother and helped
>  get them
>   dressed.  They got on the bus and ate a donut for breakfast on their way
to
>  church.
>   Keep in mind that this boy had never been to church before.   The church
>  was a real
>   big one.   The little kid just sat there, clueless of what was going on.

>
>   A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to
the
>  front
>   and picked up some wooden plates.  One of the men prayed and the kid
with
>  utter
>   fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn't
know
>  what
>   was going on.
>
>   All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking
>  place.
>   These people must be giving money to Jesus.  He then reflected on the
free
>  gift
>   of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier.  He immediately
>  searched
>   his pockets, front and back, and couldn't find a thing to give Jesus.
>
>   By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle and with
a
>  broken
>   heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it.   He finally let go
and
>  watched
>   it pass on down the aisle.  He turned around to see it passed down the
>  aisle
>   behind him.   And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was
>  passed
>   back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary.
>
>   Then he had an idea. This little nine-year-old boy, in front of God and
>  everybody,
>   got up out of his seat.  He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the
usher
>  by the
>   coat and asked to  hold the plate one more time.  Then he did the most
>  astounding
>   thing I have ever heard of.
>
>   He took the plate, sat it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into
the
>  center
>   of it.   As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said,
"Jesus,
>  I don't
>   have anything to give you today, but just me.  I give you me!"

Good morning my sisters in Christ,
Hope all of you are filling God's graces this morning.
If you have the time please pass along  these words, I only had to time to
send to some ,
it doesn't mean that all of us don't deserve hearing or reading them so if
you have a moment to share with others please do so.
Your sister , Claudette


ENJOY YOUR DAY!!



December  7, 2000

VERSE:
   Wicked men are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the
righteous stands firm.
    -- Proverbs 12:7


THOUGHT:
   This is eventually true in every culture.  An evil leader is
murdered by his even more evil successor.  Ruin comes to the one
who brings ruination on others.  But ultimately, this result will
only be fully true when Jesus comes and judges all people justly
and with nothing hidden.  Then, God's righteous will shine like the
sun, and reign with him in glory which will not spoil, perish, or
fade.  Justice with mercy, love with strength, and life without
death will find their way in the city God has prepared for those
who love him.

PRAYER:
   Dear Father in heaven.  May your Kingdom come with power in our
world and may your will be done here on earth just as it is done
heaven.  Overthrow the wicked, and let those you have made
righteous in Jesus stand in the presence of your glory and grace.
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

well as the invitation sometime this week.  Thanks for inquiring, and hope
to have you join us on Saturday.....talk soon....
