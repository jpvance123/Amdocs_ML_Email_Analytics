Following our conference call this morning and the consensus we reached, I 
placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items.  One of 
the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below.  Evidently, they 
want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can.

We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working 
well.  I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced 
since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators.  As far as we knew 
TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into 
their separator.
TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down 
in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not 
seeing any alarming numbers or quantities.
In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch 
for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, 
then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system 
down and check things out.
PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all 
fall and into the winter.  PG&E might want us to take the system down and 
check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going 
as long as we can before we do that.  
Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.  
(Caveat:  Because of all of the EOTT things going on and other related 
issues, it would help my schedule greatly if we could shift that proposed 
meeting from October 10 to anytime the week of October 16 or October 23?  I 
would appreciate it if Mike Nelson or David Roensch could arrange the meeting 
to be delayed a week or so).  The agenda for the meeting would be related to 
updating everyone on testing results, scheduling the down-time at a mutually 
agreeable time next year for checking the separators, build-out of certain 
facilities on their system related to receiving TW's gas, etc.   
We would agree to do nothing about the 1800' of interconnecting pipe at this 
point.
If you have any questions, please advise.  John Shafer

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran 
Dame of
     combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film 
career and notoriety
     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes. 

     Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the 
real-life drama, "Erin
     Brockovich," taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's 
familiar logo in
     the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs 
in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother 
of three young
     children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged 
operating
     mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually 
in the local water
     supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is 
about 130 miles
     northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on 
the
     development of tumors and other health problems among many of the 
Hinkley residents.
     By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater 
containing
     chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of 
the chromium
     eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it "did not 
respond to (that)
     problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have." It provided 
drinking water to
     nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to 
have them.
     PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. 
In 1996,
     however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 
Hinkley residents for
     a record $333 million. 

     "The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked 
it," said Jon
     Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. 

     PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, "It's clear in retrospect that 
our company
     should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
that it had." 

     Litigation against the big energy firm continues. Involving the same 
transmission pipeline
     and geographical areas, the current PCBs found in PG&E's interstate 
supplies are
     coming through Enron's Transwestern Pipeline unit at the 
California-Arizona border from
     New Mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time. Routine 
testing early in
     February turned up the suspected cancer-causing chemical, which was used 
as a
     lubricant in high-pressure pipelines and compressor stations until it 
was banned. 

     "What we are talking about here is very low levels (ranging from 2 to 22 
parts-per-million,
     or ppm), well below (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) levels 
(50 ppm),"
     according to Tremayne. 

     Since the installation of a series of filter separators on both sides of 
the
     California-Arizona border, PG&E has concentrated on testing and 
following up along its
     southern transmission system that extends some 350 miles to the town of 
Kettleman in
     the northwestern part of the central San Joaquin Valley. PCB traces have 
been found,
     and PG&E has been working with the local gas distributor in the area, 
Southwest Gas
     Corp., to test for signs of PCBs in the nearby Barstow and Victor Valley 
distribution
     systems. As of March 22, none of the definitive results were in and 
there won't be much
     before the end of this month, according to Tremayne. 

     Both state regulators and the federal EPA have been notified of the 
situation. The federal
     EPA confirmed that PCBs are authorized for use in concentrations below 
50 ppm. It is
     the EPA laboratory tests that showed PCBs were known to cause cancer in 
laboratory
     rats. 

     PG&E spokespeople were assuring the public last week that the utility 
will "take any
     additional actions necessary" as a result of data from the ongoing 
testing it is doing of its
     transmission system and interconnecting distribution pipeline systems. 
And the utility is
     planning to install additional filter separators at various locations 
along its pipeline. 

     PCB-containing lubricating oils once were used routinely by a number of 
U.S. pipeline
     companies in their gas pipeline compressors, which help push the fuel 
through the pipes.
     While they are no longer used, some of the oils have remained inside 
some pipelines since
     the 1960s and 70s. If present, they are carried in liquid droplets in 
the natural gas stream. 

     Between the newly released motion picture and PG&E's local wrestling 
match with the
     PCBs, another class action lawsuit against PG&E stemming from the 
original chromium
     issue heads toward trial, pushed by residents in Topock, AZ and former 
residents of
     Hinkley not involved in the first suit. A trial date has been set for 
Nov. 27, and CNN's
     "CourtTV" program is proposing to provide live coverage.

1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.

Rich / Larry / Earl:

I sent a letter to Mike Katz, copy to Rod Boschee, that formally restated 
what I had requested at our last meeting in San Francisco. They responded 
with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with.

I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will 
be available to attend via phone.

1.  TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer 
filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing.

action items
GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get 
agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

action item:
Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team.

Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, 
as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase 
volumes.

3. PG&E will delay / defer consideration of deconning the Topock Compressor 
Station until 2001. Tests in 2001 will determine further consideration.

4. Establishment of a gas quality committee (GQC): Larry, Rich, Earl. (I will 
continue as the lead on this with Louis Saldano available)  

GQC: Take and distribute formal minutes with agreed action items.

Mike

Attached for your reference is a copy of the meeting notes taken on July 13, 
2000 during a meeting with PG&E at TW's Flagstaff Compressor Station.  One of 
the critical issues that came out of this effort was finding out from PG&E 
that they need TW's deliveries to blend into the richer gas that they are 
receiving from El Paso and Kern River so they can meet their air permit 
emission limits on VOC's.  If they do not have TW's deliveries (dry gas) for 
the blending they will not be able to maintain compliance in some 
non-attainment areas.  John Shafer

I will be holding a conference call today at 11:00 AM (Central time) for the 
purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of 
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a 
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related 
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock 
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He 
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our 
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be 
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to 
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and 
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new 
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June 
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is "happy" with the operation of the separators and they 
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were 
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September 
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on 
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of 
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor 
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other 
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so 
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and 
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we 
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in 
that regard.  Thanks, John

John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:

1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E 
interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional 
separator installations.

2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their 
equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?

3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E 
system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be 
nice   depicting this.

4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

Larry,
Glad you got this audit out of the way.  I will be needing your agenda items 
for our meeting with PG&E so we can send them to Rod Boschee.  Think it over 
carefully, and let's have all of the items we need to discuss ready to go 
over with them.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Randy and I will fly out 
early on July 24 and maybe we can have some time that afternoon and all day 
July 26 to see some of the facilities we had discussed before.  John

John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity 
for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is 
less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work 
product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators 
becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  

I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do 
you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?  
As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the 
new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning 
activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another 
contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue 
up in Flagstaff.

Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and 
thoughts.

Subject: RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th

Larry,
Good thoughts.  I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same 
thoughts on the agenda which cover your items 1-4.  However, I will take a 
close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts 
are on there.  Now, about item 5 and your closing paragraph.   Item No. 5 - I 
do not want to open the issue of the "PCB Model" to PG&E at this time.  Maybe 
later, but not now.  As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph - Randy 
Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators "deconned".  We took great pains last 
fall (when we had the separators down) to test and decon them - so we could 
establish a "base line".  Why would we take the system down and change the 
filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility?  If we 
did that - then hypothetically - next fall (2002) when we took the system 
down and changed the filters - if we took any wipe samples - it could contain 
residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past 
twelve months.  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the 
separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will 
know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up.  I'm 
open to further argument on it - but that is the way Randy and I see it at 
this point in time.  

On the subject of the selection of the contractor - Randy and I believe that 
you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best 
job and is most dependable.  Remember that PG&E had confidence in Vector (at 
least that is what I recall from last fall).  So, if we go with a new 
consultant - will PG&E have the same confidence?  Also, you and Tiny must 
make certain that the firm we use has some "acceptable" credentials.  What 
PCB issues have they handled in the past, etc.  

I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed.

Thanks, John Shafer

Pollution Rules Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply 


By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 


???? SACRAMENTO--California's already severe electricity squeeze could 
tighten further this summer if regulators don't ease up on air pollution 
rules, power company officials said Friday. 
???? The state's 1,000 power plants--many aging and burning natural 
gas--have been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity 
scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are 
allowed for the year under their permits. 
???? Without flexibility from air pollution regulators, the plants could 
be forced to shut down or face fines. This summer California cannot 
afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand, said the 
state's last-resort buyer of electricity. 
???? "I can't tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble," 
said Terry Winter, who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys 
last-minute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it 
threatens to disrupt the state's high-voltage grid. 
???? "If it stays really hot and we've got to run every unit," said 
Winter, "then we've got a problem. If it cools off a little bit, we 
could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we won't have a 
problem at all. My sense is, by late August we'll be seeing the problem 
more severely. But we're working on it." 
???? Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the 
problem and will do their best to help avoid outages. 
???? "I was flying by the seat of my pants," said Richard Baldwin, head 
of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, who hurriedly 
struck a deal last week to keep a gas-fired turbine running on the 
Ventura County coast. The plant, which would have otherwise been shut 
down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules, is owned 
by Houston-based Reliant Energy, one of the major players in 
California's recently deregulated electricity market. 
???? Under the deal, Reliant will pay the air district $4,000 for every 
hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year. The money 
will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines. 
???? The agreement means that California's grid operators can now count 
on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply 125,000 homes. On a 
hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity, but could 
not get it because Reliant's air pollution permit allowed 100 hours of 
operation each year and only five remained. 
???? "Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and 
say no, not our problem," said Winter, executive director of the 
California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit entity that runs 
most of California's electric grid, "but they have all been very 
responsive." 
???? He said his Folsom-based staff foresaw the problem and has been 
talking with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California 
Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution 
limits for individual power plants. 
???? "They have been very, very cooperative in trying to figure out ways 
to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more 
pollutants to the air," he said. One way to do that, Winter said, may be 
to not run power plants in the evenings, when demand dips. 
???? "We don't want to put the lights out in the state," said Bill 
Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many 
will soon bump against their air pollution limits. 
???? "We asked them, if they're going to be above their caps, to come in 
and work with us on compliance plans," Kelly said. "These plans would be 
developed through public hearings." 
???? What can be done will vary with every plant in the state, said V. 
John White, who sits on the Cal-ISO board and directs the Center for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. 
???? Air quality will not suffer significantly, White said, "with some 
creative application of rules and the principle that you've got to pay 
for the pollution somehow." 
???? The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy 
production lies with California's failure in the last 10 years to build 
any major power plants. Demand for electricity in the state's humming 
economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated, while new supplies 
are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year. 
???? Several times this summer, grid operators have had to frantically 
purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from 
outages that can endanger lives and cost high-tech companies as much as 
$30 million a day in lost production. 
???? The shortage of electricity compromises air quality. When 
businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest 
demand, they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and 
phone systems. Such generators spew toxic air contaminants, particulates 
and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants. 
???? The tight supplies this summer also mean that California's old, 
inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built 
just for backup are running steadily. 
???? Duke Energy's power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the 
city after a disastrous 1989 earthquake. Typically, the costly plant 
operated 30 to 50 hours a year; its air pollution permit allows no more 
than 870 hours annually. So far this year, said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, the plant has run more than 500 hours. 
???? "The turbines date to late 1970s," he said. "They're being called 
on more and more." 
???? North Carolina-based Duke purchased or leased several major power 
plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego 
Gas & Electric after the Legislature deregulated the state's electricity 
market in 1996. 
???? One plant, in Chula Vista, generates enough electricity for 700,000 
homes in San Diego, where transmission problems leave the city 
especially vulnerable to power sags and surges. 
???? That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide 
pollutants, Williams said. "We're evaluating our options about how to 
address this problem."
