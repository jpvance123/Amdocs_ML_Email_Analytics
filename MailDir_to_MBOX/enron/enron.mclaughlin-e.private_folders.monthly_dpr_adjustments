Kori,

Please make all adjustments that are needed for the Prepay books, in the 
January DPR.  These variances are causing a problem for Faith Killen's flash 
to actual process and Arthur Anderson has been questioning the variance from 
the total value in Schedule B versus the controls group schedule. AA loves to 
dissect the prepay books!

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks!

Errol,

Could you please make the following adjustments in your NG Price DPR's, in 
order to correct the NGP&L January problem? In the 012001NG DPR, reduce the 
liquidations in Roll 4 by $2,898,246. This should bring your total hedge 
management number on your report page to $109,744,754, which will make the 
DPR tie to the NGP&L for January. Then, in your February DPR take an income 
adjustment of $2,898,246. You can add this adjustment to the PMA file that I 
sent you last week. If you make these two adjustments, it should get us back 
to where we need to be for the NGP&L tie out. Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Thanks!

Shannon

Errol,

Below is the PVR schedule that is passed on to me by gas accounting. The 
dollar amount of $79,646.37 needs to be passed through the NG Price book as a 
liquidation and an offsetting origination for Charlie Otto. In the past, 
Dutch used to handle this process, so I am sure that he could answer any 
questions that you may have. The line items that are highlighted in blue 
total the $79,646.37 that needs to be passed through the DPR. The other line 
items in the schedule have already been taken.

Thanks!!
