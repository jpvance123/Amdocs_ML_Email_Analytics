Hi Kim.
No update yet on the Caithness Big Sandy project.
However, I wanted to wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season.
I will catch up with you shortly after the first of the year.
Kirk

Kim,
 
The attached file contains a recap of the Timberline program results with a few mods.  Basic information covers what Earl and I talked about today.  Caithness engineer and Earl have discussed the use of an Ultrasonic with all of the accessories.  All of the estimates provided in the past year have been Level A's.  If we wnat a contract quality number, we need to get Engineering involved in the cost estimate.  
 
Caithness Big Sandy was not willing to spend money on an estimate when Jeff, Earl, and I met with them early in the project.  Maybe they will change their minds since the project is progressing.  Kim, let's talk with them tomorrow to feel them out.  Let me know what you think.  
 
THIS IS A +30% COST ESTIMATE.

Attached shows a revision on page 2, paragraph 1.7.  There are really two (2) 12" taps proposed; one tap on each the main and loop lines.  They both swedge up immediately to 16" and from there into the proposed Big Sandy's lateral pipeline.  Nothing else stood out.

Hi Kim.
I am planning to be in Houston Monday night/Tuesday day.
Not sure of exact schedule yet...if I can break free, I would love to see
you both personally.
If not, perhaps I can at least catch up with you via phone.
I will call you either way on Monday to set something up.
Hope that I can get a revised contract today to review.
Thanks for your efforts.
Kirk

As discussed earlier, the tap size for the above mentioned project is 16" and both main and loop lines would be tapped.  The milepost for the tie in is MP116.5 right close to mainline valve 1008.  The attached cost estimate was the latest one prepared which was August 13, 2001.  This is still a Level A cost.  Good guess is about $10,000 or less to do a Level B scope and cost estimate.  Let me know what Caithness wants in the way of an estimate.

Ron M.

Kim,
Has the opportunity ever opened up to sell additional services to Caithness?
Attached is a presentation that I gave to John Dushinske' group in August that details the services we can provide.
Let me know if there is something we can do.

Hi Kim-
Just checking on the status on the interconnect agreement and the service
agreement for operating our project pipeline.
I also wanted to make certain that I had the final cost estimate for the
facilities (interconnect)....I think I do.
Hope that you are doing well.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kim-
Quick, question...on the cost estimate, does the cost include the meter set,
etc?
If so, can we have that broken out, as we discussed, so we can independently
bid that part of the interconnect?
