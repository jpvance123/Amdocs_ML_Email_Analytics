Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions  

To the discussion I would add the following -

1. Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful.  
The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal 
and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult 
to get the "right" zones.  Moreover, in markets like ERCOT, the zonal 
structure has been co-opted by the large incumbents to frustrate the 
development of the market.

2. One solution discussed throughout the East is the "Hybrid" model - LMP in 
the real-time and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion.  If 
structured properly, this allows the power desk to have (a) a real-time 
energy market and (b) managable transmission risk.  There are disagreements 
between the policy "experts" about Flowgates (see point 5).

3. Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for 
Enron.  Key goals - 1. single control area for the RTO, 2. real time energy 
market with no penalties for unbalanced positions, 3. market hubs (similar to 
PJM West) for liquidty, and 4. manageable transmission congestion using 
market solutions.

4. I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with "one" perfect 
market structure proposal for Enron (both for technical and timing reasons - 
California is in a different place than SPP).  We are trying to coordinate 
our statements in each of the markets as much as possible.  Most importantly, 
and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately, we need to make sure that 
saying something in one market doesn't damage our other advocacy efforts.  
Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and 
place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context.   

5. We still hear some open questions about the best form of market-based 
congestion managment (option vs. obligation; use it or lose it).  Christi 
Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues.  Please contact 
her if anyone from your teams should attend.

Call with any other questions.  At some point, we need to ensure complete 
agreement of our policy(s) and our advocacy efforts on RTOs.

		 Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions

Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.  

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a "real supply curve" and a "real demand curve" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no "real" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.

------------------------------------------------

Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision 
for RTO's that was developed by the east desk.  This vision seems to differ 
somewhat from what we are advocating in the west.  In particular, it seems 
like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in 
the zonal / flow-gate camp.  I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of 
the nodal approach -- in particular, how do the nodes map to a fairly 
homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions (i.e., a 
transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it) versus 
asset-based trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade 
settles with the market.

It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant 
different models.  For example, the west has large, long-distance, high 
voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach.  The east has more 
local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily.  It also 
could be that the political reality in the east and west require different 
positions.  As things sit now, there is no way that a zonal approach could 
fly in the northwest.  In contrast, PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal.  
Finally, it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference 
of opinion on what the "ideal" market structure should be.  If that is the 
case, then perhaps we need to talk some more.

Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west, I don't 
think that we can come up with a broad, nationwide advocacy position at this 
time.  That is, I don't think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as 
"the answer" at FERC.  Instead, I think that we should focus on the 
objectives that RTO's should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the 
best market structure should be to achieve these objectives.

What do you guys think about this?

Regards,
Tim

Dear Colleague:

The Edison Electric Institute just published a report I wrote on Real-Time 
Balancing Operations and Markets: Key to Competitive Wholesale Electricity 
Markets. The report is available from the Publications page of my website, 
www.EHirst.com. Here is a summary of the report:

Electricity production and consumption must occur at essentially the same 
time. Therefore, real-time (minute-to-minute) operations and the associated 
markets and prices are essential ingredients of a competitive wholesale 
electricity industry. In addition, these intrahour markets are the foundation 
of all forward markets and contracts, including hour- and day-ahead markets, 
monthly futures, and bilateral contracts. Finally, these intrahour operations 
maintain system reliability by ensuring that enough and the right kinds of 
supply and demand resources are available when needed. 

Because of various load, generation, and transmission factors, balancing 
generation to load on a minute-to-minute basis is complicated. Loads are 
volatile, both from hour to hour and from minute to minute during the morning 
rampup and evening dropoff. Generators differ substantially in their costs of 
electricity production. In addition, generators have various idiosyncratic 
characteristics, such as maximum and minimum output levels and maximum 
ramprates, that limit their ability to respond rapidly to changes in system 
load or generation. Finally, transmission characteristics affect the 
real-time balancing function because of congestion and sudden transmission 
outages. These factors can lead to dramatic and rapid changes in electricity 
prices, including occasional negative prices when generators pay someone to 
take their output.

The early years of operations by independent system operators (ISOs), based 
on the experiences in New England, New York, and California, show how 
difficult it is to translate the theory and initial design of competitive 
markets into ones that work efficiently. These ISOs have been plagued with 
various startup problems that artificially raise electricity costs to 
consumers, implicitly encourage strategic bidding by some generators, do not 
sufficiently discipline generator market power, sometimes yield insufficient 
resources, and impair reliability. Fortunately, the ISOs have been quick to 
identify and remedy flaws in their initial market designs. On the other hand, 
the ISOs have done a poor job of documenting these problems and their 
resolutions.

This report is primarily a primer on how such intrahour operations and 
markets should work. It demonstrates these principles through several 
examples. These examples deal with generator ramprate limits, low-operating 
limits, startup costs, and other generator characteristics. Other examples 
show how energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units differ in their bidding and 
operations from capacity-constrained (e.g., thermal) units, how the 
consideration of multiple time intervals affects operations and pricing, how 
generators located outside the control area are treated differently from 
those within the control-area boundary, how interval pricing combined with 
hourly settlements can encourage generators to ignore dispatch signals, and 
how intermittent resources (such as wind) affect control-area operations. 

Although U.S. wholesale competitive markets today suffer from a variety of 
problems, there is reason to be optimistic. Ultimately, the ISOs (and, later 
on, RTOs) will identify and fix the problems within their market structures, 
and they will adequately document their problems and the associated 
resolutions so that their market participants and the designers of other 
systems can learn from past mistakes. Ultimately, efficient real-time markets 
should allow reliability councils and system operators to largely replace 
command-and-control rules with market signals (i.e., prices that vary rapidly 
in response to changes in system security). These changes should lower the 
costs of maintaining reliability; deploy supply and demand resources more 
efficiently; and guide investments in new generation, transmission, and 
demand-side resources.

OK on the call.

Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns.

A few things to think about. Here are a few options:

1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have "bid-zero" bilaterals if you want
but the basic mechanism is the same). This effectively gives you PJM, New
York, etc.

2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights
needed to schedule. That way you get the right plants on in the right
places, in theory at least. This might be interesting as a future
development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for us=
e
now.

3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be
purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need
the flow right to schedule a transaction. This is the way that a bunch of
the RTOs seem to be going (e.g. Alliance). But this still leaves you needin=
g
a way to create that feasible schedule. You can get feasibility by RT
through the LMP but my sense is that the RTO needs to make sure there is
enough capacity ready so that reliability can be protected. The problem of
the financial-only flowgate method in my book is that it doesn't meet one o=
f
the key characteristics of a workable market - e.g. it doesn't really solve
the problem of congestion while there is time to do anything about it (e.g.
bring more plants online other than a few CTs, hydros, etc.). The RTO will
need some way to handle this problem, or else handle large volumes of MWh b=
y
OOM calls at its discretion. I don't think we like that.

I was talking with some people about Alliance on Monday and they seem to
have sort of lost track of the ball, at least in my book. They are now
talking about an alternative method for dealing with day-ahead congestion.
This would effectively take the form of the re-dispatch type process used i=
n
California. My view is that this sounds pretty clumsy, adds a lot of
complication, and will be great fun for the big generators in Alliance.
Under this system I want to be AEP - the 600 pound gorilla of the region.
And it is still effectvely centralized - the ISO takes in inc/dec bids and
broadcasts out prices, calculated by the OPF model. It has all of the
elements of LMP, just done more than once. If I am a big intergrated
generator/load utility with market power I can repeat the old games of
creating congestion by my scheduling in a constrained area and then getting
paid to unwind it.

So I think we have some basic questions to address next week on the call. I
just want to make sure we get an RTO model that can be made to work without
too much duct tape and bailing wire. If we want to jump off the centralized
unit commitment train we may need to go back and consider all of the
economic angles quite carefully. I am generally sympathetic to the
decentralized commitment idea but I also want to make sure we don't end up
with a muddle.

Cheers

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe 
the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt 
everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO 
being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion 
occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic 
nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all 
the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the 
information about congestion from the past several years, they could 
essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade "above" 
the underlying FTRs as financial instruments.

Subject: Re: INTERIM MODEL TALKING POINTS  

Jim,

 I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM" 
approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion 
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as 
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized 
approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time 
changing horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of 
government.

 The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation 
problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -- 
none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the 
biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the 
nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

 During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that a 
centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PNW) 
with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro-thermal 
operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations 
and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment.  Given 
other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the paper and its 
examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant to endorse a 
centralize unit commitment implementation.

Attached are cryptic summaries of the current positions.  WPTF, APX, ISO and 
IEP are all fairly similar.  Enron is working with those parties to develop a 
common proposal.  The "Reform Coalition" (RC) is Hogan, sponsored by Sempra, 
with ORA/TURN/UCAN (they are all nuts), Reliant, Southern and WIlliams.  
Without the gens, they were going nowhere.  Southern has already left the 
coalition.  We and others have put a full court press on to Reliant (the 
source of the problem is John Stout in Houston).  The word is that Reliant 
will also leave -- we're hoping for a big splash saying both Southern and 
Reliant have left.

The other confusing issue is --why Sempra/San Diego G&E?  Terry Winter, ISO 
CEO and former officer at SDG&E, says that Sempra thinks nodalism is the only 
way to get prices high enough in San Diego to encourage construction of more 
power plants.  More power plants, more gas sales.  

The first item is a matrix from mid-April laying out all the positions at the 
time.  The RC has now introduced a slightly new proposal called "voluntary" 
-- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month-by-month 
basis.  This had not much support at the meeting at the ISO on May 10 and 11 
-- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway.

The next item is a VERY LONG (45 pps) ISO doc -- the ISO proposal is called 
zonal forward -- from late April.

I also included APX's "flowgate" model, which has some intriquing 
characteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications (it's 
very close to what we have proposed, and may be easier to use in a world with 
more parallel flows than we have today)

If you want more, more, MORE -- go to the ISO web site (caiso.com) then to 
Client Services, then to congestion reform, to see all the gory detail.

Christi,
 As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard 
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being 
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential 
consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, 
then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission 
market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach 
as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO 
Coordination (Seams) Conference:

"Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard 
tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing 
different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single 
market model."

 In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either 
filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a "feet to the 
fire" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a 
standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should 
specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights 
issue, for instance, a simple "don't allocate" solution won't work.  The lack 
of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of 
information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed 
suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be 
pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.  

 It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff 
without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a 
moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.  
There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a 
rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good 
record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such 
as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct 
risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given 
blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill 
battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current  
RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking 
creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off 
options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the 
issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other 
hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This 
also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on 
their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while 
whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to 
boost their own position.

 These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power 
this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

Steve

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe 
the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt 
everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO 
being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion 
occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic 
nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all 
the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the 
information about congestion from the past several years, they could 
essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade "above" 
the underlying FTRs as financial instruments.

Jim,

 I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM" 
approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion 
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as 
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized 
approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time 
changing horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of 
government.

 The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation 
problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -- 
none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the 
biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the 
nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

 During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that a 
centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PNW) 
with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro-thermal 
operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations 
and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment.  Given 
other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the paper and its 
examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant to endorse a 
centralize unit commitment implementation.

		 Subject: Kevin's RTO Ideas for East

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy 
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

SK - I printed this email (w/ attachment) and put it on the stack next to 
your phone messages.  mm


Rick, Jim and Steve:

Please find attached a revise doutline for the policy paper on RTO
development.

A few things to note (to make sure you are truly OK with it):

- the "base model" described will basically be a "PJM Light" with
energy-only bids. This will involve a centralized unit commitment process
(based on a constrained optimization) and financial transmission rights. All
other items on the "wish list" will be treated as future potential
developments.

- there will a substantial section on market power issues and RTO
development.

- there will a section on the relationship between wholesale and retail
market development. The main idea is that a "wholesale only" market without
price signals sent to customers is not going to be viable.

- the main conclusion section will center on a "100 days" (not literally 100
days) set of policy proposals for getting workable markets established
across the country ASAP.

Comments welcome.

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan. ?See
Section 5 - A Japanese Pool. ?They make several good arguments as to why a
mandatory pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for
Japanese liberalization. ? Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US
policy arguments.

Admittedly , ERCOT was handled poorly from a pleading submission perspective, 
but there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that , at 
the very least,  will result in a more flexible approach to market structure 
and , perhaps( this is my preference) will result in a sharpening and 
refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an 
"LMP"-like approach in real-time to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity.( 
with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights).  
Airing our differences and doubts externally creates absolutely no benefit - 
At the end of the day, we're here ( no matter where we end up on this issue) 
to enhance the company's commercial success, not to win an ideological 
battle. I understand and value the passion people in our group bring to their 
work... I don't want to lose that "fire", but merely want to assure that it 
is properly directed. We will resolve this issue shortly and am quite  sure 
we will all work hard to ensure uniformity of message at that time.

Subject: Re: FW: Enron's recent filing at ERCOT  

Ziad   and Elena and Diane and Alex,

It is not exactly true -- but I can see how people got that idea.  Enron has 
decided to withdraw the filings we made in ERCOT. Our position on the ERCOT 
market structure is being reviewed.  

Enron continually goes through a process of reviewing its policies to make 
sure they are consistent with our business needs.  I can tell you that there 
are some strong supporters of Hogan's policies INSIDE Enron now and these 
supporters are finding an ear.  

Currently, we are reviewing the positions we are taking on market structure 
in ERCOT and the east.  We have to ensure we are practical -- from a business 
point of view -- and not being just religious about our views.  Probably the 
number one concern of the business people is the ability to have a deep, 
liquid market for trading.  I believe that much of the discussion has focused 
on the ways in which we can achieve such a market.  

After our review of ERCOT, Enron may indeed support a PJM-like structure for 
the real-time market, but the filings we make will likely not imply that this 
approach be implemented everywhere.  I expect that we will be free to support 
different approaches in different parts of the country, depending on the 
evolution of the markets in each location.

What does this mean for our position in California?  So far, nothing.  We are 
standing firm on our California position, supporting the ISO and 
stakeholder-approved approach for congestion management, and do not have any 
plans to make new proposals. Further, we have the support of the Traders on 
this.

Please feel free to call with any concerns. Believe me, I'm having just as 
hard of a time working through this as you all are.

FYI:

I thought you may find this interesting.........

Enron, one of the main advocates of the zonal/flowgate model, has a change
of heart.  After putting their weight behind the zonal model since 1995, now
they are abandoning it unceremoniously. I talked to Richard Tabors today and
he confirmed that Enron, his main client, has turned around 180 degrees on
this issue. It is all the work of Ron McNamara, a key Enron person in the
ERCOT and the Eastern ISO markets. In fact Enron is bringing next week to
the PUCT hearings in Texas no other than Bill Hogan himself. ERCOT is way
down the path of the zonal model and they have almost completed the
implementation of the zonal model, but these recent developments add
substantial uncertainty to the final outcome of that market.

Hi Gregory,

Attached is Enron's recent PUCT filing on the ERCOT Protocols. This has to
be the greatest (shameless) turnaround that I've seen. The reason I say
shameless is that during the congestion management development sessions in
ERCOT, they wouldn't even let us discuss PJM-like market structures and
actually succeeded in making "PJM" a dirty word in these sessions.

Anyway, I thought you might find the attached interesting.

Shams

Folks:

My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.  

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have 
been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note 
to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture 
between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an "energy 
summit," where national and international energy leaders would converge on 
California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim 
Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was 
to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde 
notions of "turn the clock back" that the Governor of California's two most 
recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past 
several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The "energy heads of 
state" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.

The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on 
proposals I have made to the "steering committee."  However, for reasons I 
won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a 
fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be 
participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, 
and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came 
to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort 
turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved 
or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay 
participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want 
to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm 
pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in 
more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.

I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.  But the forum 
that these folks are creating ain't the right one.

Best,
Jeff

Please see Professor Littlechild's note to our former Deputy Chairman for 
Enron Europe, Ralph Hodge.  Ralph is no longer with us.  Let me know if you 
would like to support ($$) Littlechild coming to California.  He was a 
somewhat passive regulator (too academic), but is a credible authority, 
having written what is regarded as one of the seminal works on incentive 
regulation, which is the model in use in the UK.   He likes Enron, and has 
been trying to get us to pay him for some work for some time.  No need for it 
here in the UK, but I would use him in emerging markets given the 
opportunity.  Let me have your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

Dear Ralph
?
I have just written a?paper on retail  competition in electricity, arguing 
that Joskow, Hogan and Ruff, and California,  have got it all wrong, both in 
theory and in practice.? It is forthcoming  shortly in the DAE and Judge 
Institute working paper  series at Cambridge, but I thought you might like to 
see a copy now  (attached).
?
This is obviously a hot issue in California at  present, and this morning I 
received an invitation to  participate?in a debate there in November  (copy 
forwarded separately). It seems that Enron is also to be invited. I have  no 
other commitments in the US at that time.? Is is something that Enron  might 
be interested in supporting, or for that matter developing  further?
?
We spoke some time ago about the Common Carriage  Consultative Working Group 
at Ofwat. I did in fact aprticipate in that, along  with Kyran Hanks. It was 
a real eye-opener, to see how little awareness there  was of the basic 
conditions conducive to competition, like separate businesses  and accounts.? 
I'm not sure whether Enron is pursuing this now or not. No  doubt lots of 
other things going on.
?
I should be interested to hear from you on retail  competition.? I am copying 
this to Mark Schroeder and Kyran.
?
With regards
?

Rick:

Please find attached a short memo regarding last week's call with Jim and
the Enron RTO team. It also has some thoughts on what we might cover with
Steve K. at 2:00 p.m. CDT today.

Some other time I would like to have a quick chat about how we move to the
next step with the RTOs. It strikes me that there has been a real absence of
cleare-headed thinking in the stakeholder chin-wagging sessions. If FERC
will not impose a single design - on an abbreviated timeframe - is there
another way to add some economic logic into the equation?


Speak to you later...

As agreed I have put down some thoughts summarizing how to proceed on these
issues (see attachment). I have kept the schedule as tight as possible given
the urgency in responding publicly. Let me know what you think.

I don't have everyone's email here (I am at home) so perhaps Ginger can
circulate it to Steve, Ron, etc. as appropriate.

By the way if you ever want to reach me you can try (617) 513-5904, which is
a cellphone that I generally have with me (but very rarely give out the
number).

Seabron --

I hear that you are coming to Houston to discuss market structure on
Friday.  Here are some thoughts we put together related to the Alliance /
MISO debate for you to consider.

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan.  See Section 
5 - A Japanese Pool.  They make several good arguments as to why a mandatory 
pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for Japanese 
liberalization.   Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US policy arguments.

Would you please forward the attached Congestion Management Comparison chart 
to everyone in Government Affairs.   This chart was recently prepared for us 
by Tabors Caramanis.  

Although the people dealing with wholesale issues will have the most interest 
in the chart, I believe there are others who are also interested in the 
congestion management debate.

Seab/Sabine,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this important issue.  The 
three rule changes or designs in other markets you describe look very good 
and are right on point.  I would like to add two more to your list, namely: 

1) Price caps in California

Attached is a one page memo from my colleague in California, Jeff Dasovich.  
Consistent with Jeff's first two points, Steve Kean has told me that in 
addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, and 
the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have 
ordered.  I have a Nov 10, 2000 Megawatt Daily article that quotes Enron and 
Calpine as saying that price caps in California drove both companies to 
withdraw proposed plants.  

I recognize there is presently no price cap proposal in Alberta but I think 
we can draw the connection between interference through caps and interference 
through other forms of administrative intervention that are being considered 
in Alberta such as: 1) price discrimination on imports, or 2) the latest 
proposal I heard today from the Power Pool which is capping import offers 
into the Power Pool at Mid-C prices plus tranmission costs.



2) FERC Staff Report on Midwest that apparently states on pages 2-15 that 
some market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the 
Midwest because there were no price caps (see attached FERC Report).



As we discussed, I will be using this information in upcoming meetings (this 
Friday is the next one) with the Power Pool and the Alberta Gov't in support 
of Enron's arguments that policy makers in Alberta must "stay the course" 
through the higher priced periods, failing which they will make things much 
worse.

In view of the fact it is U.S. Thanksgiving could you please give me a sense 
of Sabine's timing on this.

Regards,

Rob

Christi,
=09As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard =
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being =
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential consequ=
ences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, then we =
may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission market=
, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach as =
was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO Coordina=
tion (Seams) Conference:

"Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard ta=
riff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing diffe=
rent proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single mark=
et model."

=09In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for eith=
er filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a "feet to=
 the fire" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for =
a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we sho=
uld specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission ri=
ghts issue, for instance, a simple "don't allocate" solution won't work.  T=
he lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the la=
ck of information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed=
 suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be p=
ressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power. =20

=09It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tarif=
f without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not i=
s a moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a rec=
ord.  There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome=
 of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a prett=
y good record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of good=
ies such as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a =
distinct risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is g=
iven blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge up=
hill battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on curr=
ent  RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rule=
making creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule c=
uts off options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior =
to the issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On t=
he other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued=
.  This also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies si=
tting on their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, w=
hile whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessa=
ry to boost their own position.

=09These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Po=
wer this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next wee=
k.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while mayb=

pt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the I=
SO being required to provide much greater information on where the congesti=

 nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to =
all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the =
information about congestion from the past several years, they could essent=

Jim,

=09I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM"=
 approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion =
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as =
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized=
 approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time chan=
ging horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of governmen=
t.

=09The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation=
 problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -=
- none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the=
 biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the=
 nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

=09During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that=
 a centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PN=
W) with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectri=
c and thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro=
-thermal operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW o=
perations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commit=
ment.  Given other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the =
paper and its examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant=
 to endorse a centralize unit commitment implementation.

Jim/Rick/Steve:

Please see the attached draft. I think I have everything in there we
discussed. Sorry I this has been slower than planned -as I mentioned before
I have been facing a family medical problem.

I will be out of the office for much of the next two days. I can be reached
at (617) 513-5904 (cellphone) or via email. I should be back in the office
full-time from Thursday a.m.

Cheers

Subject: Revised draft attributes paper



Please see attached.

We have tried to develop five basic market objectives, show why these
critical given Enron's strategic position, and describe some of the market
attributes that follow from the positions. I think these attributes will
lead directly to (at least our) proposed "ideal" RTO structure.

We can cut down some of the background discussion if you wish to circulate
it to any other audiences within the company. But I wanted you guys to have
a sense of where we are coming from with respect to some of the conclusions.

Unless instructed otherwise I will continue to circulate documents only to
the two of you, and you can forward to others as you see fit.

Carl has been working with Enron and others and the ISO to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for the Desert Southwest (which the ISO would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Ziad:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a "reformed" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion 
reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the "hour-ahead" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.  

Carl

[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate 
any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to

February 16, 2001
Public Utility Commission of Texas
Sent via email

Commissioners,

         Once again, I thank you for the courtesy of including me in
yesterday's PUCT workshop on the ERCOT protocols.  It has been my
experience that such open discussion of market design issues, with full
pursuit of any problematic features, is essential in achieving a successful
electricity market.  Unfortunately, the subject is complex and the details
matter.  It is not possible to anticipate every problem, but the evidence
shows that ignoring obvious problems in the hope that the rules can be
easily adapted has not been a successful strategy.  This makes what you are
doing all the more important.

         On reflection after the workshop, I am more concerned about the
argument that emerged about the role of the ISO.  In many instances, to
explain away problems of the type identified by Shmuel Oren, an argument
was made that some administrative rule along with discretionary choices of
the ISO would counteract perverse incentives created by the pricing
system.  If this argument were correct, it would seem to place a
substantial burden on the ISO to undo what the pricing incentives have
done.  When faced with such conditions in California and elsewhere, the ISO
developed a more and more intrusive role in what became less and less of a
market.  To make this unhappy practice part of the official design, to the
point that the ISO is expected to ignore the information in schedules and
do what is right, would seem to be especially problematic.  At a minimum,
it would make the ISO responsible for any difficulties that develop,
without giving the ISO the market tools to avoid the problems.

         Commissioner Wood asked at what point how a coordinated spot
market would differ from the ERCOT protocols.  We pursued the most
important feature--eliminating the balanced schedule requirement--but did
not have time to pursue all the other details.  The presentation I handed
out contains a summary of the key features on page 20.  After the workshop,
I received an email with a recent presentation by John Chandley, a
colleague of mine, that addresses the issues of market design with a focus
on California.  As I indicated in Austin, there are important differences
between ERCOT and California, but on the matter of wholesale market design
there is a great deal in common, such as requiring balanced schedules,
relying on congestion zones, applying different treatment for different
kinds of congestion, using ad hoc pricing rules, and so on.  John's summary
of the recommended reforms for California would apply in large part to the
ERCOT protocols.  I have attached a copy of this presentation for your
information.

         I remain both impressed with all that you have accomplished to
date, and worried that fundamental assumptions in the market design will
recreate problems that we have seen elsewhere.  My recommendation to adopt
a coordinated spot market more like PJM won't solve all problems, but it
would go a long way.  Whatever the difficulty now, it will be much harder
to fix these problems later.  Furthermore, the coordinated spot market role
for the ISO is much more robust.  If the simplifying assumptions of the
ERCOT protocols are true (which I doubt), the coordinated spot market will
end up looking much like the zonal model with a few constraints and easy
bilateral trading.  But if the ERCOT assumptions are wrong, the ERCOT
protocols will face serious problems and the coordinated spot market would
be a solution.  Furthermore, we now know from experience that the
coordinated spot market is neither more complicated nor more expensive than
the alternatives.  The sooner you make a commitment in Texas to adopt this
successful market design, the better.

         I offer these further remarks as I did my comments yesterday, in
the hope that you succeed.  I would be happy to discuss these matters
further, as you decide.

Best Regards,

William W. Hogan

p.s.  I do not have the mailing list for the workshop participants, but I
have sent a copy of this email to Keith Rogas of the PUCT and I assume he
can forward to the participant list.

Jim, Rick and Steve:

This is for tomorrow morning's meeting. To give us a focus for the
discussions I thought it would be best if we went through this fairly
quickly (maybe 45-50 minutes) as a presentation first.

Given the complexity of a full market design, this is obviously only an
overview. But our first priority is to present the ideas and develop the
logic behind the proposals.

See you tomorrow.

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy 
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.
