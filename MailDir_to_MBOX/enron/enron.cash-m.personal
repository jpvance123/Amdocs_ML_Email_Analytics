We do want to go to the Nutcracker if you can still get tix. Also, could you
have Trey send us the grocery delivery service website?
Thanks

Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or
anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor,
theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the
best.  I could use 5x7" the most.

Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may
want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player
attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John
Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.

We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the
Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure
that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could
get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.

See you later.

Michelle

We're getting Dad the dustbuster or keychain (unless you guys already have)
and Gretchen the placemats/guest towels and Span/Eng dictionary

Marianne wants some clarification on what kind of picture frames
(wood/metal
(type) etc and coasters (whimsical, serious artsy, material) for your list.

I'm going to prob get Trey the Lyle CD and a playstation game. Maybe a Polo
shirt

Hi, Brooks.

He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the
Women.  Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they
don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could
find him a game for the new system.  He has said that he wants a new clock
radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with
battery backup -- Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.

Let me know if you need any other suggestions.

We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

Michelle

the man

Hope all is well there.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

They do. Thank you. I'm off to Vegas Fri but will speak to you all in the
next couple of weeks I'm sure. Looks like x-mas won't happen but I think
we'll try and come down in the Spring. Are there any good times for you
guys? Does Cameron get a Spring break?

DVDs would be good.  I got him the Godfather Trilogy, but you might
consider other movies.
He has Playstation 2, so games are a good idea.
He always likes short-sleeved, solid color polo shirts in size XL.
His Rice Owls baseball cap got mutilated when the baggage cart ran over
his suitcase, so he could use a replacement.
Anything with the 40 theme would be fun.

Hope those ideas help.

Dear Tulane Traveler,

http://www.ahitravel.com/tulane/results/yaa/

Here's the deal:  you fly to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, then
are transported from the airport to a first-class hotel for
6 days/5 nights, for the bargain basement price of $895.*
You want more?  The evening of your arrival, there will be a
cocktail party at your hotel so you can meet the other young
Tulane travelers on the trip.  Upon your awakening, enjoy the use
of a knowledgeable local at the travel desk who can guide you to
either the insider's Amsterdam or the tourist bit.

In order to provide you with maximum flexibility, four different
departure dates will be offered for this trip: January 26 to
February 1, February 2 to 8, February 9 to 15, February 16 to 22,
February 23 to March 1, and March 2 to 8.

Amsterdam is a modern international city, at the crossroads of
Europe and at the heart of the Dutch experiment in social
freedom. It is also the historic city of Rembrandt, van Gogh,
and the Anne Frank House.  It is not only the center of Dutch
culture but also a melting pot of diversity.  The distinctive
architecture and numerous canals make Amsterdam one of the world's
most unique cities.  Easily covered on foot, Amsterdam abounds
with historic museums, great live music and clubs, international
cuisine, and superb shopping.   There simply is no other city in
the world like Amsterdam.

Check out http://www.ahitravel.com/tulane/results/yaa/ to learn
more about this affordable (long live the American dollar!) and
fun journey to Europe sponsored by the Tulane Alumni Association.
The more the merrier, so take advantage of this blue (and green)
light special--forward this message to your friends and start
planning today!

*****************************************************************

YES! I'd like to receive more e-mail travel offers.

please email alumni@tulane.edu with your full name and type
"Remove" in the subject line.


Sincerely,
Bill Vandivort TC '00

Departures from Newark are $795.  Still doesn't make you wish you
were from Newark, does it?

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.

Bad news girls:

I just got a call from Pam's secretary who let me know that Pam's brother
Russ was killed in a car accident last week.  Pam and I were supposed to
have lunch this week and she called to fill me in.  I don't know many of the
details yet because her secretary did not know much.

Apparently they are having a military service in Seattle and they will
probably bury him in Texas since Pam's parents are moving to Texas soon.  I
don't know when the service in Texas will be.

Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers because I know that this is
going to be terribly hard for her.  She and Russ were very close.

I'll fill you in as soon as I know more,

Thanks,
Karen
