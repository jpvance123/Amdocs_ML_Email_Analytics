ISO Market Participants;

 - MARKET NOTICE -
SUBMISSION OF GENERATOR HEAT RATE AND EMISSION DATA

The Federal Energy Commission's (FERC) April 26, Order Establishing
Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale
Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation Of Public Utility Rates
in Wholesale Western Energy Markets, imposes price mitigation on all
generators in California, including non-public utility generators, with
available capacity during periods of reserve deficiency, defined as
emergency situations beginning at Stage 1 Emergency.  FERC's price
mitigation measures will become effective May 29, 2001.

FERC directed each gas-fired generator in California (both those who have
signed Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs) and those non-public
utility gas-fired generators who sell into the ISO's markets or utilize the
ISO Controlled Grid)) to file, by May 1, 2001 (within five days of the
order) with the Commission and the ISO (on a confidential basis) the heat
rate (not including start-up and minimum load fuel costs) and emission rate
for each generating unit.

In order to facilitate the provision and use of the heat rate and emission
data to be provided by the above-described generating units, the ISO has
developed a template (attached) for submitting the required data.  The
template requests that generating unit owners provide the heat and emission
rates at various output levels.  The template also specifies that generating
unit owners must provide the heat and emission rate data "at or near" each
unit's maximum output.

Please submit the required data, in the format specified, no later than 5:00
PM, May 1, 2001.  Please submit such information electronically to Jim Price
at the ISO (<jprice@caiso.com>).  The ISO will treat all submitted data on a
confidential basis.

Effective Trade Date March 1, 2001, the ISO will implement a new Charge
Type, CT3999, to account for the Interest and Penalty Charges on unpaid
balances.  Since December 2000,the ISO has been allocating interest and
penalties to CT 1010.  All future charges, beginning with Trade Date March
1, 2001, will be reflected in Charge Type 3999.  Interest and Penalty
Charges will be made through manual adjustment (Type A) records and will be
based on the current interest rate plus 2% penalty (compounded annually,
calculated daily).  This is a monthly charge and will be posted to the last
trade date of the month.

Effective on the Preliminary Statement for trade date 3/1/01:
CT 3999 - Interest and Penalty Charge - Due ISO

This notice is intended to inform participants as early as possible of the
new charge type.

Request for Feedback on Desired Frequency of Future Firm Transmission Rights
(FTR) Auctions

The ISO completed the second annual auction of Firm Transmission Rights
(FTR) on January 19, 2001.  The one-year term for these FTRs will expire
March 31, 2002.  The ISO is now considering whether to increase the
frequency of future FTR auctions beginning with the next auction planned for
January 2002.

The ISO  requests feedback from Market Participants on the desirability of
holding FTR auctions more frequently, than once each year.

Please provide your comments via e-mail to Jim McClain, Client Relations at
JMcClain@caiso.com,  by Noon on Monday, June 4, 2001.  We thank you in
advance for your comments.

 Please direct any questions to Jim McClain at 916-608-7072 or to Scott

SC Settlement Contacts:


IMPORTANT NOTICE
Revised ISO Charge Matrix & Statement File Specification (V13.2) 

In compliance with recent FERC Order dated 6/19/01, ISO will make implement
changes in its Settlement System to support the following:

*	Credit Risk Adder; and
*	Emissions & Start-Up Cost Recovery.

Credit Risk Adder
The FERC Order put in place a price mitigation scheme for the energy markets
in the western United States.  It also directed ISO to add 10% to Market
Clearing Prices (MCPs)paid to generators for all prospective sales in its
market to reflect credit uncertainty.  The Credit Risk Adder is only used
for settlement purposes.  The ISO Scheduling System will continue to
determine MCPs using existing algorithms and the MCPs published in ISO's
OASIS will also reflect the unadjusted MCPs.  During the settlement
calculations, ISO will increase the following MCPs by 10%:
*	Dayahead and Hourahead MCPs for Ancillary Services (A/S); and
*	MCP for Real Time incremental energy.

The adder raises the MCPs, but does not affect the underlying settlement
formulation.  The only change made to the Settlement Files is the inclusion
of a new data field for the unadjusted MCP.

Emissions and Start-Up Cost Recovery
The FERC Order also directed ISO to exclude emissions and start-up fuel
costs from the calculation of ISO's mitigated Market Clearing Prices.
Generators can invoice ISO for such costs incurred as a direct result of ISO
dispatch actions.  ISO will implement two new charges:
*	Charge Type 591 - Emissions Cost Recovery; and
*	Charge Type 592 - Start-Up Cost Recovery.

These new charges serve as a mechanism for ISO to collect funds which will
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators' invoices.  A rate will be
established by ISO for each charge.  For Emissions Cost Recovery, the rate
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs,
incurred by Must-offer Generators as a direct result of ISO dispatch
instructions, adjusted for interest as may accrue in the Emissions Cost
Trust Account, divided by the sum of the forecasted in-state load served by
the ISO's transmission system.  For Start-Up Cost Recovery, the rate will be
determined similarly.  It will equal that of the forecasted annual total of
all start-up costs, incurred by Must-offer Generators as a direct result of
ISO dispatch instructions, adjusted for interest as may accrue in the
Start-Up Cost Trust Account, divided by the sum of the forecasted in-state
load served by the ISO's transmission system.  ISO plans to publish these
rates shortly.  The rates may be adjusted monthly based on ISO's latest
forecast.

Both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the Scheduling
Coordinator's Settlement Statement for the last day of the trade month.
Detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the Scheduling Coordinator on a
given day will be provided in the statement for that day.  

Implementation Timeline
The Credit Risk Adder and the new Emission & Start-Up Cost Recovery scheme
went into effect on trade date 6/21/2001.  The statements for 6/21 will be
issued on 8/15/2001.

Comments & Questions
Attached for your review are drafts of the revised Charge Matrix and
Statement Files Specification (version 13.2).   

Questions and comments related to the attached documents can be directed to
Mr. C. P. Ng via email (cng@caiso.com).  ISO plans to finalize the
specification by 8/6/2001.

REVISED MARKET NOTICE from July 6, 2001 @ 11:16AM
Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge
Charge Type 1120 (Estimate) and 
Charge Type 1121 (Actual)

ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlement Contacts:
The California Independent System Operator has contracted for peaking
generation through the Summer Reliability Agreements (SRA) to assist in
meeting reliability needs this summer.  On March 30th, 2001 the ISO
Governing Board directed Management to recover costs incurred under the
Summer Reliability Agreements as provided in the ISO Tariff Section
2.3.5.1.8.  (i.e.: "all costs incurred by the ISO ... shall be charged to
each Scheduling Coordinator pro rata based upon the same proportion as the
Scheduling Coordinator's metered hourly Demand (including exports) bears to
the total metered hourly Demand (including exports) served in that hour.") 

The SRAs require the ISO to make the monthly fixed capacity payments in each
summer month (June through October) and then true-up the penalties and
offsets in the last month. Two facilities with SRAs reached Commercial
Operation by June 15th, 2001and therefore became eligible to extend their
SRA, day for day, into November 2001. 

The ISO will allocate these charges in two phases based on two new Charge
Types, "Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1120)," and "Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1121)".  To accomplish this, the ISO will allocate an estimated charge,
based on the previous month's metered Demand and exports (CT1120).   Then,
in the following month, the entire estimated charge (CT1120) will be
reversed and the Scheduling Coordinator will be charged the actual amount
based on actual metered Demand (including exports) (CT1121).  An example of
the allocation process is as follows:

1.	The ISO will allocate the SRA amounts to the Market by applying CT
1120 (Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge) on the
Preliminary statement for the last day of the Trade Month preceding the
Trade Month for which payment is due. The estimated charges for SRA costs
(CT 1120) applicable to Trade Month June 2001 will be applied to the
Preliminary Statement for Trade Day May 31, 2001.  The ISO estimate will be
based on the Market Participant's metered hourly Demand and exports from the
prior month (in this example, the metered hourly Demand and exports for May,
2001). Charges for CT 1120 will also show up on the Final Statement for
Trade Date 5/31/01.  

2.	The ISO will then recalculate the allocation of the SRA amounts
through Charge Type 1121 (Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity
Payment/Charge) based on the Market Participant's actual metered hourly
Demand and exports for the appropriate Trade Month.  Actual (CT 1121)
charges will appear on the Final Statement for the last day of each actual
billing month.  (In the foregoing example, the charges would appear on the
Final Statement for Trade Date 6/30/01.)  As CT 1121 appears on the Final
Statement, CT1120 will be reversed in its entirety (e.g., the 6/30/01 Final
Statement will include a reversal of the 5/31/01 estimate)  The reversal can
be identified by the Trade Date for the previous month and it will have the
opposite dollar value as the previous month.  

3.	Additionally, at the end of each SRA Summer Period, the SRA amounts
are recalculated to include penalties and offsets.  The Actual Summer
Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT 1121) will be adjusted
after the owner of the facility with the SRA has received the final market
settlement for the Summer Period.

The first SRA charge (CT 1120, estimated charge) will be for the June 2001
SRA payment and will appear on the Preliminary Statement for Trade Date May
31, 2001.  This Preliminary Statement will publish on July 25, 2001.
Adjustments for June 2001 through CT 1121 (based on Actual metered hourly
Demand and exports in June) will appear on the Final Statement for Trade
Date 6/30/01, which will be published on September 12, 2001.

CT 1120 and CT 1121 will be manual charge types within the Manual Line Item
Records.  Thus, no structural changes will occur in the Specification for
Settlement Statement Files, Version 13.1 and you should not need to make any
changes in your own systems.  Finally, as this is a new process it will
remain under review and may be subject to refinement.

Should you have questions, please contact your ISO Client Relations Account
Manager.

ISO Market Participants:
in light of a growing pattern among Market Participants of failure to submit
feasible Schedules, failure to comply with the must-offer obligation,
failure to comply with Dispatch Instructions and the recent untenable acts
by certain Market Participants that resulted in serious threats to WSCC-wide
reliability, the ISO is compelled to immediately impose new requirements to
prevent reoccurrence of such events.  Please see the Market Notice posted at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html

		ISO Market Participants:
		Pursuant to the ISO's March 20, 2001 filing with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in Docket No. ER01-1579, the ISO hereby
gives notice that BEEP Split will be become effective on May 22, 2001.
		In Amendment No. 38, the ISO proposed modifications to
Tariff provisions relating to the separation of contingency reserve energy
from imbalance energy.  Amendment No. 38 gives participants an option to
indicate whether energy from Operating Reserve bids should be dispatched
only for Contingencies or System Emergencies due to energy limitations.
These bids would be separated out from the imbalance energy portion of the
BEEP stack and dispatched based on effectiveness only when there is a
Contingency or System Emergency.
		Pursuant to Amendment No. 38,  the BEEP Split becomes
effective ten days after the ISO posts a notice on the ISO Home Page that
the modified software necessary to implement the BEEP Split is ready for
use.  The ISO software modifications are now complete.  The ISO will
therefore implement this function on May 22, 2001, starting with the Day
Ahead Market for Trading Day May 23, 2001.  The ISO is providing this notice
to Market Participants via e-mail and will also post this notice on its Home
Page.
		If you have any questions, please contact Eddie Ledesma by
email at eledesma@caiso.com.

Notification of Operating Procedure Update

*	The following new or revised ISO Operating Procedures have been
implemented and are posted for reference on the ISO Website.

ISO Operating Procedure posted:  M-430 Splitting Operating Reserve Energy
from Imbalance Energy
			** Please Note: Attachment A is NOT Posted for
Security Reasons
Version: 1.1
Effective Date: 6-21-2001
Procedure Purpose: In the previous Ancillary Service (AS) Market, Operating
Reserves (OR) were combined with Supplemental and Replacement Reserve energy
bids to construct the Imbalance Energy (IE) stack.  It was often necessary
to skip Spinning and Non-Spinning energy bids when dispatching IE in order
to preserve OR margin.  Additionally, AS suppliers that were capacity rich
but energy limited were reluctant to bid into the AS market due to the
possibility of frequent energy dispatches.  Typical examples of energy
limited resources are hydro units capable of fast ramp rates and energy
production but only for a limited duration due to water availability and
emission limited resources that can only generate for a limited amount of
time.   All these resources could provide OR energy for system contingencies
and emergencies, but not for routine IE. 
Summary of changes: This is a new ISO Operating Procedure

*	Please find them at
http://www1.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/index.html under the
appropriate Operating Procedure section heading.

If you have any questions, please e-mail the 'Procedure Control Desk'
mailbox [mailto:procctrldesk@caiso.com] and we will respond as soon as
possible.

Thank-You,

ISO Market Participants:
In the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") June 19 order, the
California Independent System Operator Corporation ("ISO") was directed to
pay generators for air district mitigation fees associated with NOx
emissions as incurred by generators required to run in accordance with ISO
Dispatch Instructions.  The ISO specifically was ordered to develop an
emission allowance charge assessed against all in-state load served on or
through the ISO Controlled Grid in order to recover NOx emission mitigation
costs which would be used to pay eligible generators for such mitigation
costs.  In compliance, the ISO filed, on July 10, 2001, proposed Tariff
revisions to develop:
1.)	a rate for the emission allowance charge, 
2.)	an escrow account for monies collected; 
3.)	a process through which generators would submit to the ISO invoices
for emission mitigation fees; and 
4.)	a payment process through which the ISO would pay for such
mitigation costs.  
In a Market Notice posted on August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial
emission allowance charge rate.  The ISO  has developed details of the
methodology and calculations used to develop this rate and posted this
information at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html> .
The June 19 FERC Order also directed the ISO to exclude start-up fuel costs
from the calculation of the mitigated market clearing price, and instead, to
pay generators for such start-up fuel costs, in the same way as the ISO is
to handle emission mitigation costs and fees.  In a Market Notice posted on
August 1, 2001, the ISO published the initial start-up fuel charge rate.
The ISO has modified the previously posted start-up fuel charge rate and
provided details of the methodology and calculation used to develop this
rate.  This information is also posted at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/07/12/2001071217521028555.html

IMPORTANT NOTICE - Modification to ISO Billing Procedure 

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable;


	The current process for issuing the FERC Fee invoices has changed.
There may be additional changes in the future which would require tariff
revisions.  

	For now, the process changes are as follows:

*	Instead of sending one preliminary invoice per month for FERC Fees,
ISO will issue one preliminary and one final invoice for every trade month.
*	The monthly FERC Fee invoices will be issued one business day after
the Market and GMC invoices are generated.
*	FERC Fee invoices will be somewhat similar to the GMC invoice and
they will be EDI'd (instead of being faxed) to the Market Participants.
*	A charge type has been created for the FERC fee (CT 550).  The
settlement statements for the last trade day of the month will include the
FERC Fee charges as manual line item entries.  

	If you have any questions about FERC Fees, please contact Mike
McGuffin, 916-608-5753 or Masoud Shafa, 916-351-2216, of ISO Settlements.  

	Thank you.


	FERC Fee - Market Notice

	Introduction

	FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from
the Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

	In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35
to the ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a
procedure for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market
Participants.  

	Process

	The FERC Fee invoices will be issued to each market participant one
business day after the market and GMC invoices are distributed. The last
statement of the trade month will include the FERC Fee charges under CT 550.
A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and can be used to verify
metered load and export quantities.  

	To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data
showing that applicable load and export data was not associated with
transmission transactions over the ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting
exemption from the FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative
with the BAID, location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export
that are to be exempted. Any disputes concerning requested exemptions should
be raised in the ISO's settlement dispute process. The ISO will inform the
FERC of the total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO
Controlled Grid and the MWh exemptions requested by each Market Participants
for the FERC Fees.

	DUE DATES
	Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis for 
	a) entities with a current Approved Credit Rating or; 
	b) who maintain at the ISO a financial security posting at a level
sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation and 
	c) who are current on all obligations to ISO:
	For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an annual basis
and meet the requirements to make annual payments, the payment due date is
in accordance with tariff section 7.5.1.2.   

	For entities who do not meet the criteria set forth above, payment
is due 5 business days from the date of issuance of the monthly FERC Fee
invoice.

	Any SC payments received by the ISO will be held in an interest
bearing account.  Interest earnings will not be separately identified to the
benefit of individual Scheduling Coordinators.

	If you have any comments please contact your Account Manager.

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to
review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion
requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to
the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion
requested confidential treatment for the attachments "although the ISO and
the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO
Tariff" because they were nonetheless "concerned that release of the
information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect
the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the
generators".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the
confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each
table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This
information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to
prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market
Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.

		Energy Exchange Program Neutrality Adjustment
		Charge Type 1487
		SC Settlement Contacts:

		Background
		As you may know, the Energy Exchange Program began on trade
date 11/14/2000.  In this program the ISO obtained needed energy in the real
time market and, rather than paying for the energy as a purchase, later
returned the energy in another period.  This was not necessarily a
one-for-one exchange.  The incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned, a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued.  Since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently, there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the ISO. The ISO created Charge Type 1487 for
the allocation of the cost to SCs participating in the market during the
incoming schedules

		Notification
		The ISO has created Charge Type 1487 so that whenever an
Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance, the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the SC's based on their total
negative Uninstructed Energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place.  This new Charge Type will appear beginning on the
June 30, 2001 statements which will be published on August 23, 2001.  In
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as December, 2000
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data.

		CT 1487 is a semi automated charge, meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated, but it will be a manual charge type
within the Manual Line Item Records and will not require a change to your
settlement system.  Note that this charge will not appear on every
statement, but only when an Energy Exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance.  


		If you have any questions, please contact your Client
Relations Account Manager.

ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlements Contacts:

As you are aware, Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E") and the California
Power Exchange ("PX") have filed petitions for relief in the United States
Bankruptcy Court that are the subject of ongoing proceedings.  As we have
advised in prior Market Notices, each of these parties is substantially in
default of obligations -- pre-petition and/or post-petition -- incurred on
its behalf in one of more of the ISO markets.  The amounts owing have
resulted in a substantial reduction in monies paid out by the ISO to market
participants.  Accordingly, Market Participants likely have claims or other
legal rights they may wish to assert in either or both of the bankruptcy
proceedings.
Attached is a Market Notice that discusses the ISO's and Market
Participants' responsibilities to file such claims with the  bankruptcy
court.  Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to
their respective rights and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the
PX and PG&E.

		ISO Market Participants:
		On April 26, 2001, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) issued its "Order  Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring
Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an
Investigation of Public Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy Markets."
One of the fundamental principles of this Order is to:
			"Require sellers with PGAs as well as non-public
utility generators located in California, that make sales through the ISO's
markets or that use the ISO's interstate transmission grid (with the
exception of hydroelectric power), to offer all their available power in
real time during all hours."
		The Order also requires generators covered by the Order to
report certain generator performance data  to the ISO.
		On April 27th and 30th and on May 7th, the ISO issued Market
Notices on the Order's requirement for submission of generator performance
data.  Since that time, the ISO has received several questions regarding the
applicability of the Order to Qualifying Facilities (QFs).  By this
Supplemental Market Notice, the ISO clarifies  the Order's applicability to
QFs as follows:
		Applicability
		The Order sets forth a "must-offer" obligation on certain
generators, requiring these generators to  offer to the ISO, in real-time,
all available capacity not under contract.  At Section II.B. "Selling
Obligations," the Order provides that the  following categories of
generators are subject to the must-offer requirements:
*	Those generators with Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs);
*	All sellers into ISO markets, including non-public utility sellers,
that own or control generators located in California;
*	To the extent all sellers of energy that own or control generators
in California (including non-public utilities) are not selling "into ISO
markets", the Order includes all sellers that own or control generators in
California (including non-public utilities) whose power uses the
ISO-controlled interstate transmission facilities.
		The Order applies to all QFs in California. All QFs in
California use the interstate transmission facilities operated by the ISO,
whether supplying power under power purchase agreements (PPA) with the UDCs
or engaging in bilateral transactions.  Whether or not a QF must comply with
the reporting requirements outlined below depends on the specific
circumstances applicable to the facility.
		If a QF supplies all of its power pursuant to its power
purchase agreement (PPA) with the UDC, the QF does not have available
capacity subject to the "must-offer" condition and it does not have to
comply with reporting requirements outlined below.  In these circumstances,
the power generated under the contract is already scheduled with the ISO and
is serving load in California.
		If a QF has either: (1) a PPA with the UDC that has expired
(or who has received a regulatory or court order allowing the QF to sell the
contracted-for capacity to third parties) or (2) capacity in excess of the
amounts under contract to the UDCs, then the QF is subject to the
"must-offer" condition and it must comply with reporting requirements
outlined below.
		Reporting Requirements
		In addition to establishing a "must-offer" obligation, the
Order requires generators to provide certain operating data to the ISO to
enable it to verify the amount of available capacity from each generating
unit as defined above.  Each above-defined generating unit must submit to
the ISO data on:
1.	Pmax;
2.	Pmin;
3.	Unit ramp rate;
4.	Heat rates (for units using natural gas as their primary fuel);and
5.	Emission rates (for units using natural gas as their primary fuel).
		Please ensure that all of the above-mentioned data is
submitted to Jim Price at the ISO (jprrice@caiso.com
<mailto:jprrice@caiso.com> ) no later than 5:00 p.m. PST on Thursday, May
16.  Although the deadline for submitting heat and emission rates was May 1,
the ISO will accept those data through May 16, 2001.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

		Due to ISO system difficulties with setting up charge type
1120, the estimated allocation of the June Summer Reliability Agreement
(SRA) Invoice amounts did not appear on the 5/31/01 Preliminary Statement as
planned.  The difficulties have been corrected and the CT 1120 estimated
allocation will appear on the 5/31/01 Final Statement which will publish on
8/13/01,  instead based on final May load and export data.  

		Future SRA Allocations will remain as originally planned.


		XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


REVISED MARKET NOTICE from July 6, 2001 @ 11:16AM
Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge
Charge Type 1120 (Estimate) and 
Charge Type 1121 (Actual)

ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlement Contacts:
The California Independent System Operator has contracted for peaking
generation through the Summer Reliability Agreements (SRA) to assist in
meeting reliability needs this summer.  On March 30th, 2001 the ISO
Governing Board directed Management to recover costs incurred under the
Summer Reliability Agreements as provided in the ISO Tariff Section
2.3.5.1.8.  (i.e.: "all costs incurred by the ISO ... shall be charged to
each Scheduling Coordinator pro rata based upon the same proportion as the
Scheduling Coordinator's metered hourly Demand (including exports) bears to
the total metered hourly Demand (including exports) served in that hour.") 

The SRAs require the ISO to make the monthly fixed capacity payments in each
summer month (June through October) and then true-up the penalties and
offsets in the last month. Two facilities with SRAs reached Commercial
Operation by June 15th, 2001and therefore became eligible to extend their
SRA, day for day, into November 2001. 

The ISO will allocate these charges in two phases based on two new Charge
Types, "Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1120)," and "Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1121)".  To accomplish this, the ISO will allocate an estimated charge,
based on the previous month's metered Demand and exports (CT1120).   Then,
in the following month, the entire estimated charge (CT1120) will be
reversed and the Scheduling Coordinator will be charged the actual amount
based on actual metered Demand (including exports) (CT1121).  An example of
the allocation process is as follows:

1.	The ISO will allocate the SRA amounts to the Market by applying CT
1120 (Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge) on the
Preliminary statement for the last day of the Trade Month preceding the
Trade Month for which payment is due. The estimated charges for SRA costs
(CT 1120) applicable to Trade Month June 2001 will be applied to the
Preliminary Statement for Trade Day May 31, 2001.  The ISO estimate will be
based on the Market Participant's metered hourly Demand and exports from the
prior month (in this example, the metered hourly Demand and exports for May,
2001). Charges for CT 1120 will also show up on the Final Statement for
Trade Date 5/31/01.  

2.	The ISO will then recalculate the allocation of the SRA amounts
through Charge Type 1121 (Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity
Payment/Charge) based on the Market Participant's actual metered hourly
Demand and exports for the appropriate Trade Month.  Actual (CT 1121)
charges will appear on the Final Statement for the last day of each actual
billing month.  (In the foregoing example, the charges would appear on the
Final Statement for Trade Date 6/30/01.)  As CT 1121 appears on the Final
Statement, CT1120 will be reversed in its entirety (e.g., the 6/30/01 Final
Statement will include a reversal of the 5/31/01 estimate)  The reversal can
be identified by the Trade Date for the previous month and it will have the
opposite dollar value as the previous month.  

3.	Additionally, at the end of each SRA Summer Period, the SRA amounts
are recalculated to include penalties and offsets.  The Actual Summer
Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT 1121) will be adjusted
after the owner of the facility with the SRA has received the final market
settlement for the Summer Period.

The first SRA charge (CT 1120, estimated charge) will be for the June 2001
SRA payment and will appear on the Preliminary Statement for Trade Date May
31, 2001.  This Preliminary Statement will publish on July 25, 2001.
Adjustments for June 2001 through CT 1121 (based on Actual metered hourly
Demand and exports in June) will appear on the Final Statement for Trade
Date 6/30/01, which will be published on September 12, 2001.

CT 1120 and CT 1121 will be manual charge types within the Manual Line Item
Records.  Thus, no structural changes will occur in the Specification for
Settlement Statement Files, Version 13.1 and you should not need to make any
changes in your own systems.  Finally, as this is a new process it will
remain under review and may be subject to refinement.

Should you have questions, please contact your ISO Client Relations Account
Manager.

	The ISO has received an order to remit to the California Power
Exchange the $171,116,114.43 (plus accrued interest) which was sent by PG&E
to the ISO in payment of PX obligations.  A copy of the order is attached
below.  The ISO will make this distribution tomorrow.

	 <<ISO-PI-SCANNED.tif>>

	Additionally, with respect to the market notices on cash clearing,
the ISO will publish a list of defaulting parties after the final invoices
are settled for each trade month.  Certifications of amounts owed will also
be published only after the final invoice settlement for each trade month.

	-------------------------------------------

	April 10, 2001 Market Notice:

	Please be advised of this important follow-up from the Market Notice
of March 8, 2001, (an extract of which is provided below.)
	The ISO has been informed by our counsel that Judge Moreno has
granted the California Power Exchange's temporary restraining order request
which would prohibit the ISO from distributing the funds referenced below.
Additionally, an order is being finalized which will direct the ISO to turn
over the $171,116,114.43 to the California Power Exchange.
	-------------------------------------------

	March 8, 2001 Market Notice Extract:

	Additionally, the ISO received $171,116,114.43 ($177 million less
GMC obligation) directly from PG&E.  PG&E indicated the funds were to be
applied in payment of California Power Exchange ("Cal PX") obligations.  The
ISO has been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe
they are entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending
action in federal court entitled "Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron
Corp. v. California Power Exchange Corporation", Case No. 01-00901CM
(Central District of  California.  The Cal PX has indicated they plan to
seek an order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds
transferred to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to
Judge Moreno's Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the
ISO in a segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this
issue by that court.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
Statement File Specification (V13.1)

A new software release will be deployed to the Settlement System today.  

This software to integrate the A/S Soft Price Cap scheme into the
settlements system and eliminate manual work.  This release will take effect
with trade date 5/29/01. 

Please refer to the Market Communication concerning Statement File
Specification (V13.1) - "Soft Price Cap for Ancillary Services" dated July
10, 2001.


A more detail explanation of the changes is described in the attached
document.


Soft Price Cap for Ancillary Services 

Problem Description
Last December, ISO implemented the Soft Price Cap scheme that established a
soft price cap for both energy and Ancillary Services (A/S).  Bids above the
soft cap, if accepted, would be paid as bid (subject to review and refund),
but would not be able to set the Market Clearing Price (MCP).  The soft cap
was set to $250 initially and then changed to $150 in January.  In the
subsequent FERC Orders dated 4/25 and 6/19, FERC has established new price
mitigation schemes.  However, the underlying mechanism of the soft price cap
scheme has remained the very much similar.  The only difference is that the
soft cap becomes a more dynamic number under the more recent schemes.
The soft price cap for energy is processed automatically by ISO's Settlement
System.  For A/S, a manual process is being used.  When an A/S bid at above
the mitigated price cap is accepted, it receives two payments: one at MCP
and another that accounts for the difference between the bid price and MCP.
Currently, this surplus payment is calculated manually and appears as a
manual adjustment in the SC's statement file.  The corresponding allocation
of such surplus payments to the market also appears as manual adjustments in
the other SCs' statement files.  The manual process is labor intensive, more
prone to error and creates a large number of manual adjustments that are
difficult to track.


Proposed Solution

ISO plans to automate A/S Soft Price Cap scheme.  Once automated, the
accepted A/S bids will receive only one payment whose price is the higher of
the bid price and Market Clearing Price.  No manual adjustments will be
needed.  The entire payment will appear in the Day Ahead Ancillary Services
Due SC payments (charge types 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) or Hour Ahead Ancillary
Services Due SC payments (charge types 51, 52, 54, 55 and 56).

The Ancillary Services cost allocation (charge types 111,112,114,115 and
116) will be calculated using a weighed average prices for the service
instead of the MCPs.



Settlement Calculations

For Day Ahead (DA) A/S Due SC payments, the price will be given by:
Price = max (Bid Price, DA Zonal MCP of given service)

Similarly, for Hour Ahead (HA) A/S Due SC payments,
Price = max (Bid Price, HA Zonal MCP of given service)

For A/S Cost Allocation, the unit price of A/S obligation is currently
determined as follows:
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAMCP + HAQ*HAMCP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAQ = DA procurement target in the subject DA Region
HAQ = Incremental HA procurement target in the zones that make up the DA
region
DAMCP = MCP of the subject service in the DA region
HAMCP = Weighted average MCP of the subject service in the zones that make
up the DA region

Under the new scheme, the MCP terms in the above equation will be replaced
by average procurement costs.  Thus,
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAP + HAQ*HAP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the DA region
HAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the zones that
make up the DA region



Settlement Statements

There is no change to the settlement files structure.  The meaning of
several fields in the Ancillary Services Detail File have been modified
slightly.  These changes are explained in the latest  ISO Settlement
Statement Files Specification - Version 13.1.



Implementation Timelines

The change described above will take place in the Settlement Statements
beginning with trade date 5/29/2001, on which the FERC price mitigation
scheme (as described in the FERC 4/25 Order) took effect.

		In my earlier message, I stated that BEEP Split will be
become effective on May 22, 2001.  Please note that FERC has not yet acted
on Amendment No. 38, i.e., it has not yet approved the BEEP Split proposal.
The ISO issued this notice to provide the necessary ten days notice,
contingent upon FERC approval of Amendment No. 38.  But, the ISO will not
implement the BEEP Split unless or until the Commission approves Amendment
38.

Effective, today August 9, 2001, at 1300 the problem has been resolved and
the system is now reporting correct information.  We have removed the
erroneous historical data back to May 30, 2001 to avoid confusion.
Therefore, data will not be available for the above Transmission reports
prior to 1300 on August 9, 2001. We are currently looking into the
possibility of recreating the historical data, however a schedule for
completion is not available at this time.

* Please Note: You may notice that historical Forecasted data will continue
to be available.  Once the operating hour ends, these forecasted
transmission reports were designed to reflect the final real-time values for
that hour.  However, since the Real-time information is currently not
available, all historical hours within the forecasted transmission reports
from May 30, 2001 through August 9, 2001 will reflect the Day Ahead Final
Information until further notice.  Effective August 9, 2001 at 1300 the
forecasted transmission reports will contain the real-time values for all
historical hours as originally designed.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

The following are a few more details related to the April 26 FERC order:

1. Implementation date is May 29 per the FERC order, not June 1 as I
indicated in the MIF meeting.

2. Gas prices will be available in the new OASIS site starting 8:00 am on
May 28.  See http://oasisp.caiso.com.
If for some reason, OASIS is not able to publish the prices, we will be
sending out the prices via e-mail to all market participants and/or system
messages display in the SI workspace.

3. Replacing the bids for gas-fired generators with proxy bids during
mitigation hours:
*	We will determine mitigation hours by checking system status between
45 and 10 minutes before the start of an operating hour.  The decision will
apply for a whole hour.  We will not operate hours partially under
mitigation and partially under non-mitigation.  A report indicating which
hours are mitigation hours will be published on the new OASIS site.  The
latest status will be posted at the top of each operating hour.
*	For generators in the control area only, that we have visibility to
(individually scheduled unit, gross metering), we will be checking for
available capacity, and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental
Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity.  The bids for
the additional energy will be priced on the proxy curve.

4. Extending or inserting bids for must-offer generators by the ISO:
*	For generators in the control area only, that we have visibility to
(individually scheduled unit, gross metering), we will be checking for
available capacity, and we will be extending or inserting Supplemental
Energy bids on behalf of the SC to include the extra capacity.  The bids for
the additional energy will be priced at $0.
*	Units awarded regulation will not be subject to ISO capacity
checking, and therefore not subject to bid extending or inserting.
*	If a unit has not submitted a supplemental energy bid, we will only
generate a new Supp Energy bid for that unit if it appears to be available
and dispatchable during real-time.   In order to facilitate that we are
using the following criteria: the unit is a combustion turbine, the unit has
a non-zero hour ahead schedule, or the unit has been awarded ancillary
services.

5. Submittal of single Heat Rate and Emission Rate points, or no points:
*	For those units that have only submitted data for one operating
point, and are capable of generating over multiple operating ranges, or in
general cases where we believe the data to be inadequate, we will substitute
the operating point(s) with the data from current or pre-existing RMR
contracts where possible.  If RMR data does not exist for a unit, we reserve
the right to use other data from other sources to replace the submitted
data.
*	For those units that have not submitted any data, we will assume the
unit is a price taker and generate proxy bids at $0.

6. For those of you trying to cover your GMMs:

	A SC asked about what happens when they have to overgenerate above
their Hour Ahead schedule to cover their GMM, and then we dispatch them the
difference between Pmax and their HA schedule to comply with the FERC order.


	Example:
	SC has a 31MW unit.  Their GMM is 0.967, or about 1 MW of losses.
They usually submit an HA schedule of 30 MW, and generate at 31 MW to cover
the GMM.

	The answer is that A unit that keeps the ISO apprised of its
availability in real-time and performs in accordance with its bid
characteristics when dispatched should not receive penalties.
	A unit with a Final HA Schedule of 30 MW that is dispatched for the
additional 1 MW and generates 31 MW according to meter data will not be
penalized under CT 485.  The Total Obligation for CT 485 for a unit that is
dispatched for Incremental Energy is Final HA Schedule + 90% of Instructed
Incremental Energy.  The Total Obligation for the hour is compared to the
hourly meter value for that unit and is not adjusted for transmission
losses, i.e.. GMM is not taken into account. (Currently, penalties for
failure to perform are assessed on an hourly basis, however CT 485 may be
assessed on an interval basis in the future.)  So the Total Obligation for
the unit is 30 MW + .9 MW ( 90% of 1 MW) = 30.9 MW which is less than the
meter of 31 MW.  For CT 485 purposes, this unit will not receive any
penalties.
	It is important to note that there is a 10% tolerance or 2 MW for
Instructed Energy less than 20 MW on CT 485 penalties.  If the unit is
instructed for less than 20 MW, 2 MW will be taken off of the Instructed
Incremental Energy instead of 10%.  This means that any unit that has an
Incremental Instruction for 2 MW or less would not be flagged for CT 485
review.
	For other Settlement charge types such as, CT 401 and No Pay charges
on Spin, Non-Spin, and Replacement, a unit is required to provide the
Instructed Energy plus any transmission losses in order to receive full
credit for providing  the Scheduled Energy and Ancillary Services.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable

Second Notice - The ISO will be faxing the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices
to Market Participants this afternoon.  The following notice outlines the
FERC Fee description, process and payment options for ISO Market
Participants.  Invoices will be faxed to each Market Participant Settlements
Contact or Accounts Payable/Receivable Contact.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

(Subject: CAISO Notice - Non-Operational Generation Report Change)

ISO Market Participants:

Recently, some market participants have indicated that there is some
confusion regarding the ISO's Non-Operational Generation Report, published
once daily on the California ISO Web site. This report includes any outage
to any unit at any time of the day. However, many of the reported outages
occur off-peak while consumer demand is low. Generation that is fully
available for peak periods can be shown as unavailable, even if it was
unavailable for only part of the day. 

To avoid this confusion and to provide more up-to-the-minute generator
outage information as appropriate, the California ISO will now report
Non-Operational Units on its web site based on a "snapshot" of conditions,
rather than including all outages which may have occurred at any time during
the day. Because system conditions may change throughout the day, we will
update this report throughout the day. Beginning today, the ISO will publish
the Non-Operational Generation Report four times daily at approximately 7:15
AM, 11:15 AM, 3:15 PM, and 7:15 PM at
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/01/25/2001012508442613704.html>
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/01/25/2001012508442613704.html. The first
report will be later today. This snapshot report will state the time when
the "snapshot" was taken. 

Please keep in mind that this information is a snapshot of conditions at the
time of the report and may change at any time. Also note that there may be
multiple outages for any given unit on these snapshot reports. Without
releasing confidential information, the ISO will indicate whether the
outages are Planned or Unplanned. If there are multiple outages, there may
be more than one such designation (one for each outage of record).

We hope that this additional information will provide a more accurate
picture of generator outages through the day. If you have any questions
about this report, you may send them to Greg Van Pelt, Manager of Outage
Coordination, at  <mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com> gvanpelt@caiso.com.

		REVISED
> 	ISO Market Participants:
> 	On April 26, 2001, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
> issued its "Order  Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan
> for the California Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an
> Investigation of Public Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy
> Markets."  One of the fundamental principles of this Order is to:
> 		"Require sellers with PGAs as well as non-public utility
> generators located in California, that make sales through the ISO's
> markets or that use the ISO's interstate transmission grid (with the
> exception of hydroelectric power), to offer all their available power in
> real time during all hours."
> 	The Order also requires generators covered by the Order to report
> certain generator performance data  to the ISO.
> 	On April 27th and 30th and on May 7th, the ISO issued Market Notices
> on the Order's requirement for submission of generator performance data.
> Since that time, the ISO has received several questions regarding the
> applicability of the Order to Qualifying Facilities (QFs).  By this
> Supplemental Market Notice, the ISO clarifies  the Order's applicability
> to QFs as follows:
> 	Applicability
> 	The Order sets forth a "must-offer" obligation on certain
> generators, requiring these generators to  offer to the ISO, in real-time,
> all available capacity not under contract.  At Section II.B. "Selling
> Obligations," the Order provides that the  following categories of
> generators are subject to the must-offer requirements:
> *	Those generators with Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs);
> *	All sellers into ISO markets, including non-public utility sellers,
> that own or control generators located in California;
> *	To the extent all sellers of energy that own or control generators
> in California (including non-public utilities) are not selling "into ISO
> markets", the Order includes all sellers that own or control generators in
> California (including non-public utilities) whose power uses the
> ISO-controlled interstate transmission facilities.
> 	The Order applies to all QFs in California. All QFs in California
> use the interstate transmission facilities operated by the ISO, whether
> supplying power under power purchase agreements (PPA) with the UDCs or
> engaging in bilateral transactions.  Whether or not a QF must comply with
> the reporting requirements outlined below depends on the specific
> circumstances applicable to the facility.
> 	If a QF supplies all of its power pursuant to its power purchase
> agreement (PPA) with the UDC, the QF does not have available capacity
> subject to the "must-offer" condition and it does not have to comply with
> reporting requirements outlined below.  In these circumstances, the power
> generated under the contract is already scheduled with the ISO and is
> serving load in California.
> 	If a QF has either: (1) a PPA with the UDC that has expired (or who
> has received a regulatory or court order allowing the QF to sell the
> contracted-for capacity to third parties) or (2) capacity in excess of the
> amounts under contract to the UDCs, then the QF is subject to the
> "must-offer" condition and it must comply with reporting requirements
> outlined below.
> 	Reporting Requirements
> 	In addition to establishing a "must-offer" obligation, the Order
> requires generators to provide certain operating data to the ISO to enable
> it to verify the amount of available capacity from each generating unit as
> defined above.  Each above-defined generating unit must submit to the ISO
> data on:
> 		1.	Pmax;
> 		2.	Pmin;
> 		3.	Unit ramp rate;
> 		4.	Heat rates (for units using natural gas as their
> primary fuel);and
> 		5.	Emission rates (for units using natural gas as their
> primary fuel).
> 	Please ensure that all of the above-mentioned data is submitted to
> Jim Price at the ISO (jprice@caiso.com) no later than 5:00 p.m. PST on
> Wednesday, May 16.  Although the deadline for submitting heat and emission
> rates was May 1, the ISO will accept those data through May 16, 2001.
> 	Thank you for your cooperation.

Market Participants:

During the bankruptcy court teleconference on discovery yesterday it was
determined that 1) for the moment, the ISO has been relieved of the
obligation to respond to the subpoena, and 2) PG&E will file a motion with
the bankruptcy judge requesting the information it requires from the ISO and
the PX.  The motion will be served on the primary contact for each ISO
scheduling coordinator.  Parties will have an opportunity to respond.
Market Participants with concerns about discovery matters in the PG&E
bankruptcy proceeding should make sure they get papers from the Scheduling
Coordinator primary contact in a timely manner and be prepared to present
their own positions to the bankruptcy court.  Market Participants should not
rely on the ISO to make their arguments for them.

In accordance with the tariff, the ISO will continue to provide notice of
any subpoenas it receives that request information covered under section
20.3.  However, once this notice has been given, Market Participants have
the obligation to take the steps they deem appropriate to seek protective
orders or other relief from the bankruptcy court and should not rely on the
ISO to argue their positions for them or to provide ongoing notices of every
development related to a subpoena after the initial notice of its reciept is
given.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable;


CORRECTED ISO ABA NUMBER:    121000358

ISO Account # 14897-03272



Third Notice - The ISO  faxed the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices to
Market Participants yesterday afternoon.

However, the invoices did not contain the ABA number associated with wire
transfers to the ISO FERC Fee bank account.

Therefore, please use the following Bank Account information, if paying the
invoiced FERC Fee on a monthly basis.

ISO FERC FEE Account Information:

ABA # - 121000358
ISO Account # 14897-03272

ISO Settlements & Finance

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment
options for ISO Market Participants.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

There was an erroneous duplication entry of the 6 month rounding adjustment
made last night, June 28, published on the 05/04/01 Preliminary Statement.

The CTs affected were 1010 for a total of $262,064.98, CT 1210 for
$13,714.95 and CT 1999 for ($13,306.46).  The correct original entry was
made on Friday, June 22 for the April 30 invoice.  The duplication will be
backed out for the 05/04/01 Final.

Please feel free to contact your Account Manager if you have any questions.

		ISO Market Participants:
		This Market Notice provides additional guidance pursuant to
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) April 26, Order
Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California
Wholesale Electric Markets and Establishing an Investigation Of Public
Utility Rates in Wholesale Western Energy Markets, and the Market Notice
issued by the ISO on April 27.
		FERC directed each gas-fired generator in California (both
those who have signed Participating Generator Agreements (PGAs) and those
non-public utility gas-fired generators who sell into the ISO's markets or
utilize the ISO Controlled Grid) to file, by May 1, 2001 with the Commission
and the ISO (on a confidential basis) the heat rate (not including start-up
and minimum load fuel costs) and emission rate for each generating unit.
The ISO's understanding at this time is that this order applies to all
gas-fired generators for which the use of their output utilizes the ISO
Controlled Grid, even if they are not covered by a PGA or sold into the
ISO's markets.  If a generation owner believes there is ambiguity in
determining whether there is use of the ISO Controlled Grid, case-specific
details may need to be considered before a final interpretation can be
provided.
		The ISO recognizes that some generators' maximum and minimum
output levels, heat rate, and emissions may vary with ambient conditions.
In such cases, the ambient conditions that apply to the provided information
(e.g., specifically-described average summer conditions) should be stated as
part of the response, and the response may further state how the provided
information would vary under different ambient conditions.  The ISO will
continue to consider this issue during implementation of FERC's decision.
Owners of new generation, for which final test results are not yet
available, should provide those final test results no later than 7 days
prior to commercial operation.
		In order to facilitate the provision and use of the heat
rate and emission data to be provided by the above-described generating
units, the ISO provided a template for submitting the required data, as part
of its April 27 Market Notice.  In completing the template, the same MW
points should be used for both heat rates and emissions data.  The heat rate
(BTU/kWh) should be stated as the average heat rate at each operating point,
rather than as the incremental heat rate.  We request that you complete the
template with heat and emission rates for as many output levels as possible,
up to preferably all 11 output levels.  A minimum of two output levels
should be provided.
		Please submit the required data, in the format specified, no
later than 5:00 PM, May 1, 2001.  Please submit such information
electronically to Jim Price at the ISO (jprice@caiso.com <jprice@caiso.com>
).  The ISO will treat all submitted data on a confidential basis.

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Attached please find two discovery requests to the CA ISO from Pacific Gas
and Electric Company in the Grid Management Charge proceeding before the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC").  The discovery requests seek
invoiced amounts for the Grid Management Charge for each Scheduling
Coordinator or other appropriate party for each month of 2001 for which
invoices are available.

There is a Protective Order in the Grid Management Charge proceeding, which
is also attached.

This message is to inform Market Participants that the CA ISO will comply
with the discovery requests, unless it receives an order prohibiting
disclosure from FERC by the close of business (5:00 PM) Thursday, June 21.
The CA ISO will seek confidential treatment of the information under the
Protective Order.  Any concerns relating to the discovery requests should be

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment
options for ISO Market Participants.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

Supplemental Market Notice
Regarding Implementation of FERC's May 25, 2001 Order

On May 26, 2001, the ISO sent out a Market Notice explaining its
implementation of FERC's May 25, 2001 Order (Order Providing Clarification
and Preliminary Guidance, 95 FERC ? 61,275).  The May 26 Market Notice noted
that FERC accepted the ISO's proposal to substitute a $0/MWh bid for all
available capacity that is not bid into the ISO's Imbalance Energy market
and for which either the ISO has not received heat and emission rate
information or the information is not complete.
Under the price mitigation proposal contained in FERC's April 26, 2001 and
May 25, 2001 Orders, generation owners selling into the ISO's markets or
transmitting power over the ISO Controlled Grid have the responsibility to
bid in any available capacity into the real-time Imbalance Energy market.
As noted above, if such capacity is not bid into the Imbalance Energy
market, the ISO has the authority to create price taker bids for any
non-hydro resource that has available capacity.   Such price-taker bids will
be created by either expanding a submitted Supplemental Energy bid to
include the unbid capacity or creating a Supplemental Energy bid of $0 value
for that unbid capacity.

Although the ISO has not started inserting the $0 price-taker bids, the ISO
will begin  doing so for Trade Day June 6, 2001.  For resources in which
available capacity can not be calculated in real-time due to the lack of
relevant information (e.g., resources with significant load behind the meter
for which there is no telemetry or separate metering of load and generation
or resources that are scheduled on aggregated basis), the ISO will not be
inserting price-taker bids.

Resources for which available capacity can not be calculated in real-time
generally include Qualifying Facilities ("QFs") under Public Utilities
Regulatory Policy Act of 1978.  On May 16, 2001, the FERC issued an Order
granting, in part, motions for emergency relief filed by entities
representing QFs, see, 95 FERC ? 61,226.  The FERC authorized the sales of
"excess" QF power at negotiated rates provided that the power is sold to
serve load in California. The FERC stated that excess QF sales may be made
pursuant to either bilateral contracts at negotiated rates, or may be bid
into the  ISO's real-time market.  If the QFs choose the real-time market,
the FERC required the QFs to be price-takers.

The ISO notes that in all cases where it does not have adequate information
to calculate available capacity, the owners still have the responsibility to
bid in all available capacity under FERC's Orders.
