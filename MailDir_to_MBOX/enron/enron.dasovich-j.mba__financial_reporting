Dylan,
I scribbled down my thoughts for question 2.  Didn't spend a lot of time
making it pretty.  Give me your thoughts and we can take another pass at it.

Well it appears that Jimmy is the only one with too much time on his
hands.  Anyway, I am at home today and got to my part.  It is
attached.  Please let me know if you feel I should add anything.  I am
leaving very early Sunday morning to go on a business trip for the week.  I
will not be in class Monday or Tuesday and do not get back to the Bay area
until Saturday.  I will be checking my email so let me know what I need to
do for the next case.

Thanks for taking responsibility for this case Jeff.

Dylan

Unfortunately, I am out of town this weekend at a wedding.  Therefore with
the midterm due on Monday, I will not be able to get to the next case at
least until November 3rd.  Sorry.

Hello,

I have started to look at the case assignment for Monday.  Since, I will be
out of town the following week I will volunteer to write this one up.  I
don't know how he want to divvy up the work (by Questions or everyone does
it all), but let me know.  I have already made a spreadsheet with the
combined cash flow statement that I will send to you tomorrow.  Let me know
how we want to handle this.

I've compiled and attached what I'm calling the final case.  Dylan, I made
some changes to #1.  Let me know if you see any fatal flaws.  If not this is
what I will copy and deliver to class.

Okay gang,



I finally got home and hit the books.  I recorded the suggestions using
track changes in Word.

I made a couple of suggested changes to Kimberly's (just added a sentence
or two).

Jimmy, I changed some of your wording (cash sucking machine) and added a
few things that I saw in the financial reports.

Call me if there is a problem 925-362-0210.

Thanks,

Dylan

That is fine if you want to to this one.  We can just switch the schedule
by one week.

Hello Christine,

Attached are my efforts on the Nutra Foods case, questions 1-4.  It seems
to me this case did not require the level of analysis that the other cases
did - unless I am missing something.

I'm throwing out my thoughts on question 1 for the current case.

1.  Evaluate Patten's business strategy.

    My first thought centered around the fact that Patten's real expertise is
in real estate development.  They have a well thought out strategy of who the
customer is and how to sell effectively to these customers.  They have
developed a good business relationship with the large property owners.  With
little risk they analyze their ability to subdivide the properties.  Once
this is completed and the land purchased, they unleash their marketing
strategy.
    The marketing strategy seems to effectively gain sales without
extravegant costs.  The sales staff is custom designed to relate personally
to the average customer.  Their gross margin for land sales is 54.8%.  Even
if you include the selling, general and admin expense their margin is 24%.
    The part of their business strategy I struggle with is the finance
business.  What do a bunch of land developers know about finance.  In my
opinion land financing should be left to the experts.  If they established a
preferred financing company, they could negotiate a standard finders fee for
the loans.  More importantly they would eliminate the risk in their revenue
streams.  When they make a sale the revenue could be immediately booked since
they would not hold the debt, the finance company would.  Their current
portfolio of notes receivable is $18.6M.  It looks like ignoring expenses
their financing margin is 3%.  This only gives $0.56M in revenues.  This
number seems pretty small compared to the accounting heartburn it creates.
Obviously this number would be much smaller if they were properly estimating
unrecoverables.
    I guess the bottom line is "what is their core competency"?  I believe
its land development not land finance.

Anyway give me your thoughts and I'll clean it up in a word document.

Jimmy

Jeff:

I don't have the email with me.  It is in the classroom building I don't
remember what room.  If you show up I am sure that you can follow someone
in.  I'll be there, but I have to work in the morning so I may be a little
late.  See you there.

Here is what I have put together so far.  I just answered the questions
because I am not sure what he wants.  If you think we need to change
anything call me at 510-642-1606 tomorrow or email me by 4:00 pm.  I will
print it out and bring it to class.

I got a call from Christine around lunch, pointing out here input to 3 and
4.  I added one of here paragraph to #3.  Let me know immediately if you
disagree with the change.  We also need to talk tonight about how we're
going to coordinate these cases in the future.  I can't work on these cases
at work (I'm a supervisor in a union environment).  I got Christine's email
Sunday at 10:53 pm and it was not combined with Jeff and Kim's.  Lets make
sure we have a commitment tonight on how we're going to execute these in the
future!

My vote is similar.  Since we all ready have four adding another will cause
logistical problems.  I would suggest that we strongly urge her to seek
another smaller group.  By the way, why doesn't her original group want her
back if the only problem was that she was out of the country?
