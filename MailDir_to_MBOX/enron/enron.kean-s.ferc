Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures:

At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was 
considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the 
OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC 
response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR.

Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at 
the meeting.  These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal 
and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs.

-  FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing.  
-  The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II 
requirements
-  Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals.  
However a diversity of filings will indicate   non-consensus and FERC will 
make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly.

FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices 
standards for issuing in a NOPR.

FERC is looking for:
- more functionality and to be more user-friendly
- electronic scheduling
- electronic reservations
- reduce duplication of information entry for customers
- not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications 
 I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC 
welcomes propsals to address the control area   source/sink issues as part of 
an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order)

OASIS II should:
- continue use of Web browsers
-  use templates for file transfers (uploads and downloads)
- all displays do not have to look the same - but encourages a common look 
and feel
- within a RTO, business practicese may differ, but between RTOs the 
practices must be standardized

We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended 
to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus.  

The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buy-in an important 
element of our proposal.
If FERC adopts the NERC filing, we will likely be stuck with the exisiting 
contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC 
is not proposing any tariff changes.  Also we will not get the control area 
source/sink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in 
7 months.

Of course, another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task 
Force.

Subject: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans


1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
"off the shelf" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

Please let me know what everyone thinks.

Jim

Dan also made a comment when we were chatting that the trading floor and EOL 
tour was "discouraging in a way" because they were not yet prepared to 
regulate such activities. I thought it was kind of frightening that he feels 
they need to regulate such a free market, although it was not clear exactly 
what he meant and I was not able to pursue it with him.

Subject: Follow-up on Larcamp Visit: Comparing Gas /Electric Positions


When Dan Larcamp recently visited he commented that pipelines need to take a 
look at differences between gas and electric positions and practices.  In 
fact, his main concern about pipeline marketing affiliate practices relate to 
the fact that they differ from practices on the electric side.

I am working with Jim Steffes and Christi Nicolay on a comparison of gas and 
electric practices in the following areas mentioned by Dan Larcamp.  Here is 
a quick look at the areas that we are comparing:
Contracting for transportation/transmission capacity.  Pipelines currently 
have a form of service agreement in their tariffs, but they also enter into 
non-conforming agreements and discount agreements with shippers.  In 
contrast, transmission customers enter a two-page standardized blanket 
transmission agreement.  Then they reserve specific quantities and points 
on-line via OASIS.   This is probably the area that we'll have the most 
difficult time arguing why we are different than the electric side.
Negotiating discounts.  Customers may call or fax pipeline staff to negotiate 
discounts, although sometimes a pipeline may post a generally available 
discount on the website.  On the electric side, discounts are rarely granted, 
but if discounts are granted it is handled through OASIS.
Functionality of OASIS vs. pipeline websites.  Its true that the OASIS system 
facilitates the reservation of transmission space  (i.e. contracting) and 
discounts, but it doesn't accommodate nominations, invoices, and index of 
customers or many of the other features available on pipeline web sites.  
Marketing affiliate rules.  I plan to lay out a side by side comparison of  
Sec. 37 (electric rules) and 161 (gas marketing affiliate rules).  One 
difference, the posting of organization charts, will be gone after September, 
as pipelines will add this information to the web site.  
Content of Form 1 vs. Form 2.  Dan Larcamp mentioned that he feels like 
electric form 1s have more useful market data.  I'm not sure we're comparing 
apples and apples, as the electrics are still integrated utilities and thus 
the form 1 includes sales data. But, we'll put together a comparison 
nonetheless.

Hopefully, the detailed comparison can be completed in the next month.  Also, 
FYI Enron Government Affairs is currently working on their comments to the 
latest OASIS rulemaking and plan to use the comparison work to suggest best 
pipeline website practices that could be a model for OASIS.  I'll keep you 
posted.

FERC Meeting Update (Ray and Donna are at the meeting and may have additional comments when they return):

Interconnection:

It appears that FERC will issue an Advanced NOPR on interconnection procedures (not cost issues) which will basically be a strawman proposal encompassing the ERCOT interconnection procedures.  These procedures will be used as a strawman proposal for standardized interconnection procedures throughout the country.  FERC is going to hold an informal conference in Washington the week after RTO Week (i.e. the week of Oct. 22) to hammer out these issues.  The hope is that consensus will be reached.  Once the procedures are resolved, FERC will then address costs.  Wood wanted to address both issues at the same time since they are so closely related, but Brownell and Breathitt both thought it was better to separate the issues since cost issues are expected to be more contentious and they did not want to slow down getting standardized procedures in place.

Market Based Rates:

This issue was stricken from the agenda.  Wood said they need more time to study the issue.  Breathitt stated some concern that they are going to use the SMA screen (discussed last meeting) because it is still somewhat undefined.  After discussion, however, all the commissioners agreed that they are not voting on anything, and they will decide whether use of the new screen makes sense when they see a draft order applying the new screen to either a triennial review or a new application for market based rates.  Due to RTO Week, Staff does not expect to get an order out using the new screen until November.  

MidWest ISO:

Donna will provide a more complete account of the order, but there were a couple of interesting statements.  This case is primarily about rate issues raised by the MidWest ISO filing.  From the discussion, it sounds like the commission is going to provide some RTO guidance to Midwest, even though the order does not address the scope issue, but it appears that the commissione is still looking at an implementation date of December 15, 2001 for MISO.  We will have to see the order to better understand what this means.

Wood had some interesting questions about costs.  Apparently, MISO proposes to assess a 15 cent administrative fee for its services.  Wood asked why the corresponding savings are not being reflected in the individual utilities' rates.  Because the RTO is now going to provide many of the services the utilities were previously providing, Wood said he would expect the utilities rates to go down, by more than 15 cents collectively, and he wonders where those savings are going to be reflected.  This is good -- Wood is going after the utilities and not allowing them to play these types of games they have played for years now.

Carolina Power and Light and Florida Power Corp.

This is an order on rehearing.  FERC grants rehearing of a prior order regarding imbalance penalties.  Some intervenors argued that the penalties should be credited back to customers.  The prior FERC denied this request and allowed the utility to retain the penalties, but the new FERC has granted rehearing.  Wood said this is consistent with gas and he think basic customer issues should be treated similarly on the gas and electric side.  This too is a good sign that Wood "gets it" and sees no reason why the electric industry should not be treated the same as gas.  We have been arguing for this for years.  This is hopefully a sign of more good things to come.

Call us if you have any questions.

FERC issued an order this morning staying indefinitely the California Refund proceeding.  In its order (attached), FERC notes that many requests for rehearing are pending and FERC intends to act on those requests soon.  FERC states that if it were to grant rehearing, it could affect the refund calculations being determined in the hearing proceeding, so FERC is staying the hearing proceeding until further order from the Commission.

While we don't know what FERC will say on hearing, it is very likely that the rehearing order will be a significant departure from the July 25 order.  We will let you know of any further developments.  If you have any questions, please let me know (202) 466-9160.

		 Subject: Draft Comments for Thursday

Folks,

Here is my first draft.  My time trial shows it takes 6 min and 45
seconds to deliver.  We need to cut.

Dan, can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make
copies?  Send me the front end from last week's filing supporting EPSA's
motion.

I'll take comments up to 12 noon Wednesday.
gba
=============================


The Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) is a California non-profit trade
association of almost thirty members who sell, buy and exchange power
throughout the Western U.S.  We are pleased to provide comments on the
following areas in response to your Order issued last week.

1. Price caps and their unintended consequences

2. Forward scheduling, penalties, mandatory must-buy, and

3. Independent Governing Boards.

First, I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall
gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order.  The members of WPTF
have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer, and
equally upset by the actions of non-jurisdictional parties in their
attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring, and drive it into
the ground. As I listened to your comments last week, I took note of all
the things you said, and the stated purpose of your actions.  After
listening to you, and reading the Order, I very much wanted to be here
today, even if it only afforded me a brief 5-minutes of your time.  I
would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one
phrase to be uttered publicly.  And that phrase would be "Thank you.
Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive California's
wholesale power market.  Thank you for having the courage to stand up to
parochial interests which are entirely self serving, and absent of any
national policy goals."

This Commission took a stab at correcting California's problems
utilizing several measures, one of which was a $150 price cap.  Whereas
we applaud the Commission's effort,  we find that price caps send the
wrong signal to both suppliers and load.  We have found that price caps
misallocate resources, and as your Staff report demonstrates, increases
exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists.  We
find that price caps discourage demand-side participation, and at the
level proposed, will discourage much needed peaking generation
resources.  We also find that any price cap, but especially at the level
you have proposed, will create unintended consequences.  For example,
when market bids exceed $150, sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or
the PX.  Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a
competitive exchange to the PX, such as APX, or AlTrade?  Will the
liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because
of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates, and
above which the bilateral market prevails?  That is a huge hammer, a
huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of
an hour from one trading vehicle to another.

WPTF has been against price caps, and continues to believe that price
caps do much damage, and do not protect consumers.  The damages include
prolonging high prices, reducing price discovery, and reducing the
quantity of long-term offers that otherwise would afford consumers
much-needed price protection.  Average prices do not diminish with caps,
in fact, as you know, August prices in California were much higher than
last June, even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing
Board was $250 instead of $750.

We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators don't
like price spikes, and caps are a quick solution.  If you feel that
price caps must be imposed, then limit the damage.  We believe that
Commissioner Hebert's price cap proposal which starts at $250, and
increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the
least damaging.  We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves
with respect to demand, or fuel price would be the most harmful.  Market
participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging
in the balance.  The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance
that California needs regulatory stability, and the Commission is
pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability.  On the other
hand, floating price caps work in the opposite direction.  They reek
havoc because they inject more uncertainty, and lessen stability.  If
price caps are at all necessary, stick to the least damaging approach.

WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand, the imposition of real-time
penalties, and we support elimination of the must-buy provision embedded
in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision.  Underscheduling of
load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation, and
reduced grid reliability.  Mandatory pre-scheduling will get the ISO
back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be
exposed to real-time resolution.  Also, by eliminating the must-buy
provision, the UDCs can no longer complain about "supply not showing
up". Their avenues for finding cost-effective supply will be unlimited.

Finally, we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with
independent board members.  Whereas we have been troubled by the antics
of the ISO Governing Board, we must note that the PX Governing Board has
not had the same type of problems. The PX Governing Board has done much
better at finding solutions to thorny problems.  But it is asking too
much, we think, to spare one and eliminate the other.  The actions of
the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the
credibility of electric restructuring.  Other states eschew
restructuring after observing the endless debates, the layers upon
layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO
Governing Board, and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of
Governors with interests totally removed from the well-being of the very
institution on whose Board they serve.

We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the
stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough.  There may be incredible
pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates
that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers, but in
fact, are making a power grab.  My organization promises the Commission
that if we suspect, if we have evidence, if we detect, or otherwise
observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board, I
can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest.
The California market simply can not survive serving two masters.  The
jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move
forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in
Orders 888, and 2000.


Thank you.

On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy 
reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, 
even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to 
cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or 
curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that 
Aquila had a "fundamental misunderstanding" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that 
a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission 
provider's own reservations "are based on the legitimate reliability needs" 
of its bundled retail customers.

Reservation facts:  Entergy posted on its OASIS site that it reserved 2000 MW 
of capacity at its interfaces with TVA (1100 MW), Southern (400 MW), Arkansas 
Electric Coop (250 MW), and Union Electric (250 MW) under the label "Firm 
Import for Native Load."  Entergy did not designate network resources in the 
same manner that it required from Aquila and other network customers.  
Entergy explained that its reservations were needed "to meet the immediate 
reliability needs of the Entergy System and to accommodate native load growth 
over the next few years."  (Entergy later told FERC that this was needed for 
"current loads" only--not future growth.)

Entergy argued to FERC that it is able to satisfy its generation reserve 
requirements, while maintaining lower amounts of generating capacity within 
its control area, only because it can rely on the 2000 MWs at issue to reach 
neighboring control areas, therefore this is "a legitimate reliability 
need."  Entergy then claimed that Sec. 28.2 of the pro forma tariff (that 
requires a transmission provider, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, to 
designate its network resources in the same manner as any Network Customer) 
does not apply to a utility's uses of its transmission system to serve 
bundled retail customers. 

In a draft order issued today, FERC disagreed with Entergy and found that 
Entergy reserved virtually all of the firm capacity on four key interfaces, 
even though it had no off-system network resources.  Instead, Entergy used 
its firm transmission reservation to purchase power whenever it was 
economical.  Entergy denied all other firm transmission requests and 
entertained non-firm transmission requests only when it was unable to make an 
economic deal for itself.  Even though Entergy is not required to take 
transmission under its tariff for retail load, it is required to designate 
network resources and loads.  The off-system resource must be generation 
owned by the transmission provider or under contract.  

Although FERC found that Entergy violated the OATT and normally the 
transmission should be released, Entergy has now begun to designate network 
resources (these new procedures are pending at FERC).  Aquila also asked FERC 
for its financial losses of $281,000, but FERC said it lacked authority to 
order money damages.  FERC would order refunds of the transmission rate, but 
Aquila did not allege that it paid for services it did not receive.

Interestingly, FERC told Aquila that it could bring this matter up in Entergy 
Power Marketing's currently pending 3 year update of its market-based rates 
stating that  use of the transmission system on a non-preferential basis is a 
fundamental condition for market-based rates.  (Entergy argued against this 
saying that there was no allegation that it had profited.  FERC rejected this 
argument.)  Dynegy has already protested Entergy's 3 year update stating that 
Entergy is exercising market power by limiting new generation through poor 
interconnection procedures and agreements.  Enron filed one sentence support 
of Dynegy's protest.  I think this is why Entergy recently filed its 
interconnection agreement and procedures at FERC.

Comm. Herbert dissented saying that this was a "technically" from several 
years ago.

Watch for this type of activity from other providers.

protested:

Certain Governance provisions 
The allocation to the utilities of the PTRs (physical transmission rights)
The balanced day ahead scheduling requirement (telling FERC that it should 
require a real time energy market instead)
Suggest an alternative approach to the ICAP market in which the ICAP is 
monitored and a market only established after the icap drops (incentivizing 
the LSEs to keep their reserves at the required level)

Steve -- I believe that the note from Dan below responds to your request  for 
an outside counsel response concerning the appliability of recent FERC refund 
orders to bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of 
Water Resources (CDWR).  Let me know if you would like a formal opinion 
letter or if there is anything else I might do for you.  Later Joe

		 Subject: Sales to CDWR


The $150 "soft price" cap that FERC adopted in its December 15 order applies 
only to sales of power into the California ISO market and California PX 
day-aheadand day-of markets.  These are the real-time and short-term markets, 
respectively.   By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not apply 
to any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of 
Water Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.

Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability of 
the cap may change in the future.  In a recentlly released report, FERC staff 
recommends that the cap be discontinued after April 2001 and replace by a 
series of other measures to mitigate market power.  Thes include a marginal 
cost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to the 
participating generator agreement.

Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future might 
argue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects the 
same role as was formerly performed by the PX.  Based on that proposiiton, it 
might be argued that a price cap similar to the "soft price" cap  be imposed 
on sales to the CDWR.

Per Mr. Steven Kean, of Enron Corp. please see below ( Appendix C - Order 8=
88=20
"Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission
Dominance).=20

                                                                 APPENDIX C


          Allegations of Public Utilities Exercising Transmission Dominance

          I.  Examples From Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges

               These are examples of allegations that various public

          utilities have refused to provide comparable service, either

          through refusals to wheel, dilatory tactics that so protracted

          negotiations as to effectively deny wheeling, refusals to provide

          service priority equal to native load, or refusals to provide

          service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own use.

               A.  American Electric Power Service Corp. (AEP)

               In 1993, AEP filed, on behalf of its public utility

          associate companies, an open access tariff that offered only firm

          point-to-point service with very limited flexibility.  It did not

          offer network service, flexible point-to-point service, or non-

          firm service.  Thus, it did not provide customers with the same

          flexibility that AEP itself has.  Nor did it provide a service

          priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load.  The

          Commission set AEP's tariff for hearing and, on rehearing, held

          that in order not to be unduly discriminatory, the tariff had to

          offer comparable service.  American Electric Power Service Corp.,

               At hearing, Raj Rao of Indiana Michigan Power Agency (IMPA)

          (Ex. IMPA-1, Feb 23, 1994) and Kenneth Hegemann of American

          Municipal Power-Ohio, Inc. (AMP-Ohio) (Ex. AMPO-1, Feb 23, 1994),

          both senior management officials, testified concerning AEP's
=0F,






                                        - 2 -


          alleged discriminatory practices. 1/  AMP-Ohio is an

          association of municipalities in Ohio, some of whose members

          depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service.=
=20

          IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana, and many of

          IMPA's loads are captive to the AEP transmission system.  The

          witnesses alleged as follows:=20

                    1.  In anticipation of high peak demands, AEP would

               contract for large blocks of available short-term power,

               withhold sale of short-term power, refuse to transmit third

               party short-term power, and require purchases from AEP at

               the emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) when an emergency might

               not exist.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6.

                    2.  In December 1989, AMP-Ohio negotiated a 20 MW

               purchase of short-term power from Louisville Gas & Electric

               Company (LG&E).  AEP refused to wheel because LG&E had

               earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP.=20

               AEP then bought the power from LG&E and offered to resell it

               to AMP-Ohio.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6-7.

                    3.  In January 1990, AMP-Ohio solicited bids for

               February power purchases from a number of utilities

               including AEP.  AEP was not the winning bid.  AMP-Ohio made

               arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders

               and sought transmission through AEP.  When AMP-Ohio gave AEP
                             =20

          1/   After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the
               proceeding, AMP-Ohio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no
               longer necessary.  This withdrawal does not change the fact
               that the testimony was sworn to under oath.

               the schedule for delivery, AEP refused to transmit the

               power, matched the average price of the winning bids, and

               made the sale itself.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 7.

                    4.  In August 1993, an AMP-Ohio member (Columbus, Ohio)

               was purchasing 10 MW of hourly non-displacement power from

               AEP and, after AEP raised its price to 60 mills/kwh, sought

               another source for the next hour.  Consumers Power Company

               and Detroit Edison Company both offered non-displacement

               power at 40 mills.  AEP refused to transmit, saying it had a

               600 MW unit out and could not resell power from another

               source. 2/  Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to

               buy 10 MW of power from AEP at 100 mills/kwh.  Ex. AMPO-1 at

               7-8.

                    5.  In July 1993, two AMP-Ohio members (Columbus and

               St. Mary's) had been buying hourly non-displacement power

               from AEP when the price rose to 35 mills.  Dayton Power &

               Light Company (DP&L) offered to sell at 23 mills and AEP

               agreed to transmit for one hour.  But for the next hour, AEP

               said it had problems with its system, refused to transmit

               the power, kept the power from DP&L for itself and offered

               to sell power to AMP-Ohio for Columbus and St. Mary's at 100
                             =20

          2/   AEP generally limited its offer of short-term transmission
               to buy/sell transactions; that is, AEP would buy the power
               from the seller and resell it to the purchaser.=20
               Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker (Ex. A-73) at
               27-29.  Often, the terms of the buy/sell transaction
               required transmission dependent utilities (TDUs) to maintain
               reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a
               year.  Id.   =20

               mills.  Columbus increased its local generation, but St.

               Mary's purchased 8 MW at 100 mills.  For the next hour, AMP-

               Ohio arranged with DP&L for another 8 MW, hoping AEP would

               transmit under the 24 hour buy-sell agreement.  AEP did

               transmit this power.  Seven hours later in the day, St.

               Mary's Greenup Hydro project power was available and the 8

               MW from DP&L was no longer needed.  If St. Mary's had been

               receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit,

               St. Mary's could have switched to Greenup power.  But

               because AMP-Ohio had changed to daily service, St. Mary's

               had to pay a demand charge for the entire day, even though

               it used the power only 7 hours and would have paid less

               under the hourly rate.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 8-9.=20

                    6.  In January 1994, AMP-Ohio sought to transfer power

               from one member with generation to other members, which

               required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines.=20

               Toledo Edison said yes, AEP said no.  AMP-Ohio's northern

               members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison.  AMP-

               Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny

               transmission and AEP agreed to transmit.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 9. =
=20

                    7.  IMPA arranged to buy 80 MW of short-term power from

               LG&E and have it wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements,

               through Public Service Company of Indiana (PSI) and AEP to

               serve IMPA's load at Richmond (an IMPA member).  The

               delivered price was $.292 per kW-day plus a 1 mill adder.=20

               At the same time AEP arranged to buy 300 MW from PSI at $.30
=0F,






                                        - 5 -


               per kW day plus out-of-pocket energy costs.  Hence, PSI was

               shipping a total of 380 MW to AEP with 80 MW of that amount

               to be delivered to IMPA's load at Richmond.  Then, on a day

               when IMPA should have received the 80 MW, AEP told IMPA that

               PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to

               buy from AEP at $.63 per kW day plus the cost of energy from

               AEP.  IMPA purchased from AEP under protest.  AEP used its

               control over transmission to intercept the 80 MW at a lower

               price and resell it as short-term power to IMPA.  AEP

               claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that

               day.  But the 80 MW was independent of PSI's other sales to

               AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not

               interrupted it.  IMPA-1 at 7.

                    8.  IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located

               at one member, which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint

               Transmission System owned by IMPA, CINergy and Wabash Valley

               Power Association.  To do so, IMPA needed a metering

               agreement with AEP, to which AEP would not agree.  IMPA-1 at

               6.

                    9.  In January 1994, IMPA had power to sell from its

               turbines when AEP and others needed power.  IMPA offered

               power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power

               without an existing contract.  Moreover, since there was no

               short-term tariff, IMPA could not sell the power to another

               utility.  IMPA-1 at 6. =20

                    10.  Another example of the utility engaging in

                                        - 6 -


               dilatory tactics that raised the customer's transaction

               costs and effectively denied transmission is the "sham

               transaction" provision proposed by AEP.  As filed, AEP's

               tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a

               portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a

               former retail customer of AEP.  See, e.g., Ex. BR&WVP-1 (J.

               Bertram Solomon testimony, February 23, 1994).  (As part of

               a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew

               this provision.)=20

                    11.  Finally, AEP's originally filed tariff contained a

               "prodigal customer" provision.  Under this provision,

               transmission customers who sought to convert back to

               requirements service had to give AEP five years' notice, in

               which case AEP and the customer would enter into

               negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service

               at all and if so under what rate, terms, and conditions.=20

               Ex. S-39 at 1 (Staff testimony).  AEP did not require notice

               from all new customers, only from prodigal customers.  Id.

               at 2.  That a potential customer was previously served by

               AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently.  (AEP

               withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff.)

                    B.  Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy)=20

               Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR

          pro forma tariffs except for two provisions (headroom and

          ancillary services).  Because the settlement predated the filing

          date for customer testimony before the ALJ, the customers did not

          address the need for Entergy to file a tariff.  However,

          customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices, as

          follows.    =20

                    1.  Customers alleged that Entergy flat-out refused to

               wheel.  Louisiana Energy and Power Authority (LEPA) witness

               Sylvan J. Richard testified that LEPA's predecessor systems

               could not obtain interconnections from Entergy.  Ex. SJR-1

               at 50.

                    2.  Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to

               provide service priority equal to native load and refused to

               provide service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own

               use.  For example, LEPA witness Richard testified that even

               after state commissions ordered interconnections and other

               coordination services, LEPA's predecessors were still not

               able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not

               willing to coordinate and because the transmission service

               it did offer was inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point

               service, which prevented economic coordination with others.=

                    3.  South Mississippi Electric Power Association

               (SMEPA) witness J. Bertram Solomon testified that Entergy's

               original "open access" tariff was restricted to point-to-

               point service, proposed separate charges for each operating

               company, and required the cancellation of existing

               agreements in order to take service under the proposed

               tariff.  Ex. SMEPA-10 at 28.  Entergy eventually filed a
=0F,






                                        - 8 -


               network tariff, but proposed different local facilities

               charges for the various Entergy public utility operating

               subsidiaries.  Id. at 29.  Since these local facilities

               charges were higher than the transmission component of the

               subsidiaries' bundled rates, Entergy obtained a competitive

               advantage.  Id.

                    4.  The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives (ACC) is a

               group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate

               electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas.=20

               ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has

               segregated the wholesale market between two of its

               subsidiaries, Arkansas Power & Light Copmpany (APL) and

               Entergy Power, Inc. (EPI).  Ex. SMM-1 at 16.  In marketing

               power and energy in Arkansas, EPI is subject to an Arkansas

               Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for

               wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver.  Id.=20

               Recently, EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale

               transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers

               currently served by an Entergy subsidiary; in other words,

               EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition

               for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete

               with APL.  Id.  ACC witness Merchant concluded that, since

               EPI does not compete with APL, Entergy insulates APL's

               wholesale business from competition and denies those

               wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power,

               thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to

               ACC.  Id. at 17-19.  (Entergy's witness Kenney stated that

               Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the

               Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit

               EPI to sell to APL's wholesale customers.  Ex. JFK-11 at 14-

               15.)

               C.  Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E)

               Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) attached several

          documents to its 1988 complaint in Docket No. EL89-4.  These

          documents were provided to support NCPA's claim that PG&E's

          unreasonable practices under the PG&E/NCPA Interconnection

          Agreement (IA) effectively denied NCPA access to transmission

          properly requested under the IA.  Although the parties eventually

          settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter

          order dated May 18, 1988, these documents provide allegations of

          PG&E using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to

          effectively equal a refusal to wheel. 3/      =20

                    1.  PG&E stated that since transmission was not

               currently available, it was entitled to wait 72 months

               before providing transmission; that is, transmission access

               could not be granted before the passing of the 72-month

               notice period.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 3.  However, the IA
                             =20

          3/   All of these incidents are related to and examples of PG&E's
               conduct described in the NOPR (FERC Stats. & Regs. =0F4 32,5=

               at 33,073 n.151), that is, the history of PG&E's attempt to
               avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the
               California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP).  However,
               these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents
               described in the NOPR, because NCPA is not one of the owners
               of the COTP.

               provided that transmission be provided when it becomes

               actually available.  PG&E also requested substantial

               additional information, which NCPA considered beyond that

               reasonably necessary for a study, but still provided.  PG&E

               then determined that transmission was not available,

               reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the

               transmission requested could be provided 8760 hours per year

               without restrictions or limitations, extending through the

               expiration of the agreement in 2013.  NCPA 1988 Complaint at

                    2.  On November 27, 1987, NCPA made a new transmission

               request to PG&E, seeking 50 MW of bi-directional

               transmission at Midway.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 5.  On

               January 28, 1988, PG&E filed an interconnection agreement

               with Turlock Irrigation District (TID) that provided TID

               with 50 MW of bi-directional transmission at Midway.=20

               This is the case where Northeast Utilities acquired Public

          Service of New Hampshire (PSNH) (Docket No. EC90-10).  New

          England Power Company (NEP) witness Robert Bigelow's direct

          testimony expressed concern over the "relatively restrictive

          transmission policies of both" NU, on behalf of Northeast

          Utilities' public utility subsidiaries, and PSNH.  Bigelow Direct

          Testimony at 21 (filed May 25, 1990).  In his cross rebuttal

          testimony, Mr. Bigelow testified that "NU has a poor track record

          as a provider of transmission service" and "PSNH also has an

          abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services."=

          Bigelow Cross Rebuttal Testimony, at 3 (filed June 20, 1990).=20

          Mr. Bigelow described both NU's and NEP's (his own company)

          failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own

          use.  Except for NEP's TDUs, both NEP and NU historically

          provided only point-to-point transmission, which required

          separate scheduling for each transaction.  Bigelow Cross Rebuttal

          instances of Edison's conduct.  Richard Greenwalt was the power

          supply supervisor for the City of Riverside, California.  He was

          responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside

          and for the cities of Azusa, Banning and Colton, California.=20

          supervisor for Anaheim.  He supervised Anaheim's load scheduling

          and is a former Edison employee, having worked for Edison for 20

          years.  McCann Testimony at 1-2 (November 1989).  These witnesses

          testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows.

                    1.  Edison's policy was to curtail the Cities any time

               it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable

               reasons to deny interruptible transmission service.  Id. at

               22-23.=20

                    2.  Edison would not generally provide transmission

               service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing

               the economy energy that would be wheeled.  McCann testimony

               at 19.  The Cities called Edison every hour to request

               interruptible transmission service.  Id..  Edison often

                                        - 13 -


               refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems

               Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost

               contract energy or partial requirements service.  Id. at 19-

               20. =20

                    3.  When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm

               transmission of power from neighboring states, Edison would

               often agree to provide non-firm service but would not

               integrate the capacity for many years in the future, saying

               that its control area did not need capacity at that time.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 9.  Since the selling utility was

               interested in a sale of capacity, not just energy, the

               transaction would not occur.  Id.  Edison repeatedly used

               its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low-

               cost firm power.  Id. at 9-10. =20

                    4.  While Edison provided short-term firm transmission

               service to the Cities, it would only provide long-term firm

               service for three specific resources:  the SONGS nuclear

               plant, a specific IPP, and Hoover Dam power.  Hoyt testimony

               at 20.  One of Edison's reasons for denying long-term

               transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the

               transmission for its own future (unspecified) needs.  Id. =

                    8.  Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde

               and was told that such service was not available.  Carnahan

               testimony at 16.  Edison offered Riverside only 12 MW of

               curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riverside's

               share of Palo Verde.  Id.  This service was neither large

                    enough or long enough, and Edison insisted on

                    unreasonable terms and conditions.  Id.

                    9.  Azusa, Banning and Colton had a contract with

               Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm

               transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract

               energy obligation.  Edison refused to permit the three

               cities to use that path.  Edison did not contest that the

               contracts allowed this use, but said that the scheduling of

               such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be

               too burdensome.  Greenwalt testimony at 14.=20

                    10.  Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the

               Cities' requests, routinely taking months to respond.  Drews

               testimony at 15.

                    11.  During the 1980s, Edison provided Colton with some

               transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain

               suppliers, but limited the choices available to the Cities

               and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities'

               costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison.=20

               Drews testimony at 9.  Arranging alternative generation

               sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first

               get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission.=
=20

                    12.  During 1988 and 1989, a dispute arose between

               Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating

               Project.  Drews testimony at 16.  Edison argued that for the

               months when units were out of service for uprating, and

               Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero, Southern

               Cities would not receive an energy credit, even though

               energy was still available and used by Edison.  But the

               contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to

               still schedule its energy as non-firm energy on the capacity

               of another participant.  Id. at 16-17.

                    13.  In 1986, Azusa negotiated a power purchase

               contract with the California Department of Water Resources

               in increments of first 5 MW and then 2 MW (for a total of 7

               MW).  Hsu testimony at 14.  First Edison assured Azusa that

               the transmission for the additional 2 MW would not be a

               problem.  Id.  Then Edison would not agree to amend the

               transmission service agreement for the additional 2 MW.  Id.

                    14.  In 1986, Azusa notified Edison of Special

               Condition 12 4/ purchases from PG&E and requested firm

               transmission service.  Id.  Two months before service was to

               begin, Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the

               transmission lines.  Id.  Transmission was eventually

               granted, but only after a four-month delay and substantial

               losses to the Cities.  Id.  Then Edison decided there was no

               problem with its transmission facilities.  Id. at 14-15.

                    15.  In 1986-87, the Cities purchased 20 MW from PG&E

               and 80 MW from Deseret G&T Cooperative.  Hoyt testimony at

               7-8.  Edison stated that without reinforcement of its

               transmission system, Edison would not provide the

               transmission.  Id.  There was a five-month delay during

               which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a

               higher cost.  Id. at 8-9.  Then Edison decided that the

               transmission system did not need reinforcement.  Id. at 8.

                    16.  Edison also refused to provide a service priority

               equal to that of native load.  It would curtail the Cities

               in order to purchase more economy energy for itself.  McCann

               testimony at 28.  If Edison could make the purchase, it

               would curtail the City and use the energy for itself.  Id.=

               When Edison curtailed the Cities, they were not able to

                             =20

          4/   Special Condition 12 of the Integrated Operations Agreement
               between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain
               Special Condition 12 resources and allowed the Cities to
               make certain uses of those resources, subject to certain
               restrictions.=20
=0F,






                                        - 17 -


               purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from

               Edison.  Id. at 24.

                    17.  According to Edison, the interruptible

               transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for

               any reason.  Id. at 20.  A purchase could be terminated the

               hour after it is begun or even during the hour.  Id.  As a

               result, the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous

               economy purchases.  Id. at 20-21. =20

                    18.  Edison also refused to provide customers

               flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided

               itself.  Edison's refusal to provide bi-directional

               transmission service restricted the Cities' abilities to

               purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 22.  Because most contracts with Northwest

               utilities require a return of power, the Northwest utilities

               would not deal with the Cities without transmission to

               return energy.  Id. at 22-23.  Edison did provide bi-

               directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of

               Water & Power (LADWP) to accommodate flows to and from

               Arizona.  Id.

                    19.  Riverside was unable to obtain non-firm service

               more than two hours in advance of need.  Carnahan testimony

               at 18.

                    20.  Riverside and Colton were both served out of

               Edison's Vista substation.  Although the two cities were on

               the same 69 kV bus, Edison would not allow them to sell

               energy to each other.  Greenwalt testimony at 17.=20

                    21.  Riverside's agreement with Edison allowed

               Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and

               divide it up among the four Cities (Azusa, Banning, Colton

               and Riverside).  Greenwalt testimony at 17.  When Riverside

               had excess energy from other sources, Edison would not

               permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities.=20

               Id.  For example, Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy

               transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system.  Id. at 17-18.=20

               LADWP would not break out the Cities' shares of that energy,

               and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all

               four cities.  Id. at 18.  Edison argued that because this

               energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use,

               Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into

               the control area.  Id.  As a result, Riverside paid for the

               energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area, but

               could not sell it to the other three cities, and gave it to

               Edison itself, which consumed the energy without making any

               payment for it.  Id.  Riverside tried a number of

               alternative paths, including using WSPP transmission where

               Riverside paid Edison 5 mills to connect to Azusa, 5 mills

               to connect to Banning, and 5 mills to connect to Colton for

               each megawatthour.  While this approach was successful for a

               while, eventually Edison refused to permit these sales. =20

                    22.  Edison claimed that the Cities only have

               transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition 12
=0F,






                                        - 19 -


               energy to satisfy the Cities' load.  Greenwalt testimony at

               18. =20

                    23.  Edison contended that the Cities' load

               requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources

               and then by Special Condition 12 and economy energy

               purchases.  Id. at 19.  When the Cities' integrated

               resources exceeded their load, any Special Condition 12

               resources became excess.  Under Riverside's Deseret

               contract, the Cities were required to take a minimum of 35

               MW each hour.  Id.  Edison acknowledged that it was

               obligated to buy, or allow the Cities to sell, any excess

               energy from Riverside's integrated resources.  Id.  However,

               Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special

               Condition 12 energy brought into the area, claiming that the

               Cities could not have brought it in because they did not

               have transmission rights.  Id. =20

          II.  Other Examples of Transmission Disputes

               Disputes over transmission are not uncommon, contrary to

          EEI's suggestion.  Some recent examples taken from pleadings and

          other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has

          been very difficult for various entities in the electric power

          industry to agree on transmission rights.  These examples also

          reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR

          with its proposed pro forma tariffs, there has been considerable

          controversy over whether various utilities' "open access" tariffs

          deviate from those tariffs.  (The Commission has allowed
=0F,






                                        - 20 -


          utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the non-rate

          terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain

          certain benefits.)

                    A.  In a letter of February 3, 1995 to Mr. Gerald

               Richman of the Commission's Enforcement section in the

               Office of the General Counsel, Steven J. Kean, Vice

               President, Regulatory Affairs, Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

               (Enron) alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMo)

               refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E)

               to Enron under RG&E's transmission contract with NiMo;

               however, when Enron revealed the buyer, NiMo did wheel power

               for RG&E to the buyer.  Mr. Kean alleged that this was not

               an isolated incident.  NiMo argued that the contract did not

               require it to provide RG&E with transmission to Enron.  It

               also said that the principle of comparability does not

               require the service.  Letter of November 21, 1994 from NiMo

               representative A. Karen Hill to Gerald Richman.

                    B.  The Commission's Task Force Hot Line (Hot

               Line) received a complaint that a member of the New

               York Power Pool (NYPP) refused to transmit power that

               another member bought from a power marketer.  In a

               letter of November 17, 1994, from Chair Moler to Mr.

               William J. Balet, Executive Director of NYPP, Chair

               Moler explained that the Commission's enforcement staff

               had investigated and found the allegation to be true.

                    C.  In Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency

               v. Northern States Power Company (Minnesota), 73 FERC =0F4

               61,350 (1995), NSP and SMMPA had a contract under which

               NSP agreed to provide transmission service.  However,

               the parties had numerous disputes over the service.=20

               The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the

               contract in several ways.  For, example, SMMPA argued

               that it should be able to directly schedule its

               deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and

               that it should not be limited to particular points of

               delivery.  NSP argued that only it was entitled to

               control the physical operation of scheduling.  The

               Commission found that the clear language of the

               contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own

               power. =20

                    D.  Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, 72 FERC =0F4 61,223

               (1995), involved MAPP's membership criteria, which made it

               impossible for a power marketer to join MAPP and obtain the

               benefits of certain transmission services available only to

               MAPP members.  The Commission found that the membership

               criteria may be unreasonable, particularly since there may

               be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria

               for non-traditional entities.

Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for
Manipulation by Power Firms

By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

It's a market ripe for manipulation: surging demand for
an indispensable commodity, weak oversight and a
chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy
regulation to open competition. This is the state of
the U.S. electricity business in the summer of 2000.
And sure enough, there's growing evidence that some
power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit
the system -- at consumers' expense.

The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity
auctions, taking juice from transmission systems when
suppliers aren't supposed to and denying weaker
competitors access to transmission lines. None of this
is illegal, and much of it might be considered basic
competition. But as an electricity shortage plunges
sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears
of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast, the
practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than
ever. (See related article.)

Steamy Conditions

A hot summer day last year shows one kind of
manipulation. On July 28, 1999, wholesale electricity
prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit $935 per
megawatt hour. That was seven times what it costs to
generate power at the most expensive plant in the
region. An analysis of trading data from that day shows
that PECO Energy Corp. and PPL Corp., the old
Philadelphia Electric Co. and Pennsylvania Power &
Light, made the most of steamy conditions.

In the region's power market, deregulated in 1997, a
new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the
transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight
utilities. It also operates a daily electricity auction
that sorts the hourly bids of 540 generating plants.
The cheapest plants are called on first, but when the
weather is hot and demand is acute, higher offers are
taken as well. To attract as many bidders as possible,
the highest bid, each hour, sets the price for the
entire market for that hour.

Grid and Bear It

Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key
transmission-interconnection points for the month of
May from 1997 to 2000.
TRANSMISSION-INTERCONNECTION POINT
           % CHANGE 1997-2000

Mid-Atlantic region                           +80*
   *Includes only years 1999-2000

What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at
low prices so that the majority of their plants would
be called into service. But knowing demand was so high,
they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly
higher bids, in a way that often set the peak price for
a number of hours. Consumers that day ended up paying
millions of extra dollars for power.

Cases like this show that during the transition to
deregulation, "there's a good argument the system has
broken down," says William Massey, a commissioner at
the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. FERC, which
polices the nation's bulk power markets, began the
deregulation movement in 1996.

It wasn't supposed to be this way. In the old days,
utilities generated electricity and delivered it to
customers in exclusive territories. To protect
consumers from gouging, rates were regulated. But while
supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times,
demand varied widely within regions, between regions
and from one season to another. The result was
tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste.

Deregulation, now under way in half the country and
functioning nationally at the wholesale level, allows
new players -- some affiliated with utilities, some
not -- to build power plants and sell electricity.
Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets.
Risks are borne by investors, not ratepayers.

At the same time, utilities are surrendering control of
long-haul transmission lines to new nonprofit
operators, like the one in the Middle Atlantic region,
which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid --
the multistate system of high voltage lines.

Under this new regime, energy prices should have
dropped as companies raced to compete with one another.
But the massive U.S. energy infrastructure wasn't
designed to serve as the backbone of a free market. On
hot summer days, when there's little or no surplus
electricity in the nation's most populous regions,
generators can charge prices far in excess of their
production costs and be confident they'll get tapped
for service by grid operators who must keep the lights
on at any cost. Utility holding companies that still
control transmission lines have an added advantage:
They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors.

The new regional grid operators, called independent
system operators, or ISOs, eventually will be in charge
of preventing manipulation. But as nongovernmental
organizations, they won't have basic investigative
tools, like subpoena powers or the ability to impose
significant penalties. FERC, which does have those
powers, rarely uses them, preferring to let the market
discipline itself.

A Strange Drop

Sometimes it's difficult to know what constitutes an
abuse of the market. In July 1999, engineers noticed
that a substantial amount of power was being taken from
the grid for which there was no explanation. They
contacted the North American Electric Reliability
Council, the industry group charged by Congress with
overseeing the grid since the late 1960s. After a
lengthy investigation, NERC determined that Cinergy
Corp., a utility holding company, had surreptitiously
taken enough power over a three-day period, about 9,600
megawatt hours, to light a small city for a month.

Cincinnati-based Cinergy had underestimated power
demands. Rather than buy electricity on the open market
at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati,
it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand
was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the
night when demand wasn't so high.

James E. Rogers, Cinergy's chief executive, received a
letter from A.R. Garfield, the chairman of NERC's
regional power-coordination center, accusing his
company of showing "blatant disregard" for the rules
and of using the grid "as a supplemental resource
without regard to the reliability or integrity of the
system."

But Cinergy paid no fine. That's because it runs its
own transmission "control area" and is trusted to
enforce NERC's voluntary rules, even when it is the
violator. Smaller utilities in Cinergy's area, by
contrast, face contractual penalties of as much as
$35,000 per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from
the grid, a practice known as "leaning on the ties."

Dancing on the Edge?

Mr. Garfield is still steamed about Cinergy's actions,
which he said removed part of the system's essential
reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts, or a chain
of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole
sectors of the country. "How fair is it that someone
can dance on the edge like that and get away with it?"
he asks.

Mr. Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to
temporarily borrow small amounts of power during
emergencies. "We were very careful to make sure, when
we leaned on the ties ... we didn't bring the whole
system down," he says. Nevertheless, he concedes, "in a
competitive world, those rules need to be changed." The
region's regulators have since gone to FERC for
authority to charge "borrowers" for the market value of
the electricity they take off the grid.

Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is
being frustrated on the country's transmission system,
a vast web of connections that resembles the nation's
highway system before the construction of the
interstates. While there are plenty of routes to get
electricity from outlying power plants directly to big
cities, there are relatively few routes connecting
regions. That makes it possible for some big companies
to shut out competitors.

A Snag in Transmission

St. Louis-based Aquila Energy hit that snag when it
tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New
Orleans-based Entergy Corp. to move electricity to a
buyer in East Texas. Entergy granted the request,
initially, but then it canceled, saying it didn't have
sufficient space on its lines.

Aquila didn't buy it. After analyzing
transmission-capacity data, the company argued to FERC
that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so
was in effect breaking a rule that required it to
provide transmission-line access when possible. Without
access to Entergy's lines, Aquila was forced to
compensate the buyer and lost nearly $300,000 on the
deal. From whom did the Texas customer end up buying
the power? A unit of Entergy -- and for a higher price
than it would have paid Aquila.

FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to
restrict access in this case, because it had
transmission problems. But FERC found that Entergy, on
other occasions, had hoarded transmission capacity that
should have been made available to the market. Entergy
declines to comment.

Such scenarios are costly for consumers, and they are
among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying
flush times. In the second quarter just ended,
companies ranging from AES Corp. in Arlington, Va., to
Enron Corp. in Houston reported huge profit increases,
some as much as 50%. To be sure, a lot of those profits
are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a
pickup in energy trading. But Sean Murphy, president of
Southern Energy New England, a unit of Southern Cos.,
Atlanta, Ga., worries that the industry has gotten too
greedy and risks retribution. "Pigs get fat, but hogs
get slaughtered," he says.

Tremendous Volatility

New federal data show that average wholesale power
prices have more than doubled at 14 of 17 key pricing
points across the country in the past three years. By
May of this year, prices had risen across a broad
range -- by 89% in Florida, for example, and by 294% in
Texas. But even these increases mask the tremendous
volatility that has struck all the major wholesale
markets during the past year. In the case of the
Midwest, where prices in July 1999 hit $9,000 per
megawatt hour, it was as if a $1.89 gallon of gas
suddenly sold for $567.

Prices like these have prompted growing calls for
investigations into whether electric companies are
gouging their customers. Some consumer groups, lukewarm
to deregulation in the first place, now are agitating
for re-regulation. Residential electricity bills have
doubled in San Diego, which is notable because it's the
first city in the nation to be served by a utility
that's buying all of its energy on the competitive
market.

Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific
Northwest. There, wholesale prices peaked at a record
$1,300 per megawatt hour during the last week in June.
Energy-intensive industries like mines and aluminum
smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily
laying off workers. "We may be seeing too much
opportunism in the market," says Montana Gov. Marc
Racicot. Demands by Mr. Racicot and his counterpart in
Washington, Gary Locke, were instrumental in prompting
FERC to open a national investigation in late July into
possible market abuses.

A Six-Month Lag

One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a
free flow of information will let markets police
themselves and operate efficiently. But a key tool for
market monitoring, the data on utility Web sites used
to book transmission orders, is often unreliable.
There's a six-month lag on the release of bidding data,
which are coded to mask the identities of bidders.

What's more, the four FERC-controlled ISOs operating in
California, the Middle Atlantic states, New England and
New York don't have the authority to compel market
participants to give them internal documents, like
bilateral contracts, and other information they don't
want to hand over. Without such documents, "there's a
lot more looking than finding," says Bill Museler,
chief executive of the New York ISO.

Even if the ISOs do find something problematic, there
isn't much they can do about it. The tariffs, contracts
and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit
them from releasing company-specific data and so
exposing wrongdoers. And with the exception of
California, the ISOs' own board meetings are closed to
the public. "The reality is, confidentiality rules
protect the guilty," says Frank Wolak, a professor of
economics at Stanford University and chairman of the
California ISO's Market Surveillance Committee. "And
there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of
fair play."

That can be a huge problem on hot days. In California,
an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in
which it tries to match the next day's anticipated
demand to bids by generators. But this summer,
generators often have offered less power than they know
will be needed, so that they can submit higher bids
later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for
emergency power. On occasion, ISO engineers have had
just 40 minutes to frantically phone around and nail
down suppliers, knowing that if they fail they could be
forced to begin rolling blackouts. The bidding
strategy, while legal, "undermines reliability and
forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics," says Kellan
Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the California
ISO.

Generators say they aren't to blame for the mad
scramble. Utilities, buying power for their customers,
often order less power than they really need for fear
that a big order will drive up the overall market price
to prohibitive levels.

The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to
rewrite the rules governing their local markets. But
FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because
generators are investing billions of dollars based on
existing market rules. There's another reason, too,
says Ron Rattey, a veteran FERC economist who in June
wrote a 10-page internal memo criticizing the agency
for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct. "Every
single ISO has identified strategic abuses," he says.
"And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules,
the market participants find new ways around them."

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

We will hold a conference call within 1 to 1 1/2 hours after the conclusion 
of the FERC meeting this morning on California.  Joe Hartose and Donna Fulton 
are at the Commission for the meeting, and they are hoping to talk with FERC 
staff after the meeting to get a better idea of the thinking at FERC, so we 
would like to hold off on the conference call until they have these

Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday =
to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press =
reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in Sept=
ember, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The curren=
t document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly =
considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of=
 the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate enti=
ties.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable w=
ith the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibilit=
y for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect pri=
ces in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blen=
d the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that=
 is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industr=
y participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate disc=
rimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to a=
ct due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso=
 case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affect=
s the California market, both gas and power.=20

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a "Pat Wood" Commission=
 is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer =
community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  th=
at the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at t=
he affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting tha=
t he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Jo=
e Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community =
has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfort=
able with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a=
 lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Co=
mmissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits. =
=20

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranpor=
tation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our markete=
rs believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors=
 in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport c=
osts.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that m=
ore education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.

FERC has two meetings in July (July 11 and 25) and then is on recess for th=

 September 12.  Consequently, FERC tries to get out as many orders as it ca=
n in July so the backlog is not as great in September. =20

Consistent with that goal, FERC has included a lot of cases on its July 11 =
agenda.   While some of these cases may be stricken from the agenda for Jul=
y 11(and either deferred to the July 25 meeting or until September), we are=
 still expecting a lot of action from FERC in July.  The following cases ar=
e on FERC's July 11 agenda:

RTO Proceedings

Alliance RTO

SPP and Entergy RTOs

PJM and PJM West RTOs

New York RTO

New England RTO

RTO West

Southern RTO

Two new RTO dockets entitled "Regional Transmission Organizations"

Other Proceedings

Mirant vs. ISO New England (June 20, 2001 complaint by Mirant regarding ISO=
's proposal to revise procedures for mitigation of generators run out of ec=
onomic merit order during transmission constraints).

NYSEG v. NYISO (regarding ISO's hybrid fixed block pricing rule)

NERC (these are old docket numbers that go back to orders issued in 1999 re=
garding TLR -- Southern and VEPCO sought rehearing of the TLR procedures in=

FERC issued an order today approving, with conditions, the merger between A=
EP=20
and CSW.  EPMI was active in this proceeding, arguing that the merging=20
companies have transmission market power and that FERC should require the=
=20
companies to mitigate that market power before approving the merger.  EPMI=
=20
proposed that the companies be required to form a TransCo before the merger=
=20
could be approved.

Although the Commission did not require the companies to form a TransCo=20
before approving the merger, the Commission did agree with many issues rais=
ed=20
by EPMI and other intervenors, and the Commission adopted the testimony=20
submitted by Enron and two other intervenors on this issue of market power=
=20
(rather than adopting the rebuttal testimony submitted by AEP where AEP=20
attempts to prove that it will not have market power after the merger). =20
Specifically, the Commission found that the merged entity will have market=
=20
power, so it ordered the companies to join a FERC-approved RTO by the Order=
=20
No. 2000 deadline (i.e., December 15, 2001).  Under Order No. 2000, an RTO=
=20
can be a TransCo, an ISO, or some hybrid of the two. =20

Furthermore, the Commission found that because the companies=01, market pow=
er=20
will not be eliminated until the RTO is up and running, interim mitigation=
=20
measures are also needed during the period prior to RTO membership. =20
Specifically, FERC requires the companies to turn over the duties of=20
calculating and posting ATC to an independent third party (a suggestion mad=
e=20
by EPMI), and also directs AEP to provide generation dispatch information t=
o=20
an independent market monitor in order to monitor AEP=01,s generation activ=
ity. =20
The Commission orders AEP to respond to FERC within 15 days of whether AEP =
is=20
prepared to accept these conditions. =20

We will continue to monitor this proceeding and we will notify you of any=
=20
significant developments.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for 
the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on 
the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing 
Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the 
failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers 
on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to 
better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some 
at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been 
presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think 
Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further 
regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated 
pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These 
are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains 
accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information 
used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during 
Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie 
Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as 
part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, 
I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to 
discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to 
establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in 
these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked 
about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into 
California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El 
Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

The ALJ issued his initial decision on the CPUC complaint case today.  As was widely expected, he found that El Paso and its merchant affiliate, El Paso Merchant, were guilty of affiliate abuse.  However, he did not find clear evidence that they were exercising market power.

Subject: Order 888 Argument


Please think about the following:
=20
In a 20-minute Supreme Court argument [the limit will be strictly observed]=
, one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts, but one cannot co=
unt on being able to make more than 2-3 points, and each of them needs to b=
e clear from the first sentence; points that require development don't work=
.  In light of that:
=20
1.    Should I plan to spend any minutes on the "New York" side of the case=
, i.e., arguing that *all transmissions over the grids are in interstate co=
mmerce and FERC has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or r=
etail*?  On the one hand, the "NY issue" is more important to Enron than th=
e "Enron issue"; on the other hand, my sense is that we are way ahead on th=
e NY issue after the briefs, and the SG will likely do a good job on it in =
argument.  My sense is that I should be prepared, if necessary, to utter so=
mething like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph, a=
nd to defend it against any questions, but should not otherwise plan to get=
 into these issues.=20
We should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address NY's wacky =
preemption argument, which the one that it relied on most heavily in its op=
ening brief.
=20
2.    I think my most important tasks are to make clear that (i) this case =
is about FERC's power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate=
 grids (and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales) and (ii) i=
t is important to the nation that FERC have such power.  I need to make the=
se points quickly and vividly, in a way that the Justices will carry away. =
 That is going to be hard, because theoretical abstractions are not vivid, =
examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details, and m=
etaphors are generally too inexact.  Please consider whether I am right abo=
ut the two points being most important, and think about how to make them.
 I think these points are the most important, along with making the Court c=
omfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not b=
e turning upside down a federal/state regulatory division that's been in pl=
ace for 60 years. =20
=20
3.    Although in a formal sense our case turns on the Chevron issue (plain=
 language, no ambiguity, hence no room for discretion), my instinct (but I =
am not at all sure about this) is that I should not plan to devote time to =
these matters.  First, they are covered well in the briefs.  Second, whethe=
r one sees "ambiguity" does not really depend on staring at the language bu=
t on understanding what "transmission in interstate commerce" necessarily c=
overs in the present age.  In other words, the way to win the Chevron point=
 is to win the points in the previous paragraph.  Hence I ought to prepare =
to get the word "unambiguous" in there somewhere in the middle of a sentenc=
e, and defend it if necessary, but not do more.  Does this seem right?=20
I think it's worth giving a little more attention since this is the key iss=
ue below and, ultimately, the issue on which the Court must rest its decisi=
on.  We don't want to lose the trees for the forest.  That said, since we'v=
e dealt with it at length in the briefs, I don't know that we need much mor=
e than a reminder of the issue and the arguments:  FERC asserts that sectio=
n 201(b) does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with=
 retail sale is a transmission or a "sale of electric energy at wholesale".=
  It concluded that such transmission is a sale.  The D.C. Circuit erroneou=
sly held that FERC's interpretation was permissible.  But transmission does=
n't stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generat=
ion:  it is both transmission and a necessary component (query whether "com=
ponent" is the best word to use) of a retail sale.  Therefore, under the cl=
ear language of section 201(b), jurisdiction over all transmissions, includ=
ing transmissions bundled with retail sales, is vested in FERC.
=20
On the related point of NY's position that the wholesale/retail bright line=
 applies to transmission:  in particular light of NY's interpretive gymnast=
ics in its reply (re: 201(a), at p.6), isn't a good one-liner simply that i=
f Congress intended to limit FERC's transmission jurisdiction to transmissi=
ons for wholesale, then s. 201(b) would read "The provisions of this subcha=
pter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associ=
ated transmissions" (or something to that effect)?
=20
Note:  this issue opens the door to discussion of, among other things, whet=
her the exclusive purpose of section 201(b) was to fill the Attleboro gap; =
and questions about the structure of the FPA, e.g., the relationship betwee=
n 201(b) and 211/212, 206(d), etc.
=20
4.   What do I do in argument with LP&L?  I find the NGA parallel very comp=
elling, and IF the Court decides to go with us it will have no problem citi=
ng and following that case.  On the other hand, the argument does not seem =
to have persuaded anybody but our team (not CADC for example).  On balance,=
 I am inclined to say "The Court has already decided this issue under the p=
arallel provision of the NGA" and use some time to press that point.  One r=
eason for doing so is that in general it will be much EASIER for the Court =
just to affirm FERC and CADC than to push thru the complexities and agree w=
ith us, but LP&L gives them both a precedent for overruling FERC on its own=
 jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the case.=20
Agreed.  =20
=20
5.  I need to understand why FERC's powers and plans to create regional tra=
nsmission organizations do not fully solve the problem.  I need to get a de=
tailed understanding of the facts, and a one-sentence answer to why there i=
s still a problem.    =20
The primary answer in our reply is that Order 2000 does not require RTOs, i=
t only encourages their voluntarily formation; and that there's no indicati=
on that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled.  (p. =
19)
=20
6.  Most important:  What other points (in addition to 2 and 4) does anyone=
 think I need to be sure to make?  Even more important, what points made by=
 NY, SG, EEI, California are most likely to trouble the Court and provoke q=
uestions?  Which of them should I plan to answer even if I get no question?
We might also need to address whether our position runs against 60 years of=
 history:  Didn't the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales u=
ntil Order 888?  Does our position mean that FERC historically abdicated it=
s responsibility and the states were regulating without authority?  What is=
 the effect of section 201(a) if not to allow states to continue to regulat=
e the matters that they regulated in 1935?  This may be an issue to broach =
only if the Court indicates interest, though, since I think it's the toughe=
st one for us to answer.
=20
We might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounti=
ng issue.  It seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initia=
l brief will basically hedge our bets:  it makes our affirmative argument a=
 little harder (since we can't simply say that it's crazy to base FERC's ju=
risdiction on an accounting technique), but it also makes NY's argument har=
der, since they can't simply say that but for a change in the accounting fo=
r electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmis=
sions for retail sale.  This would also dovetail with some of the other bri=
efs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electr=
ic service necessary to support competition among generators, and something=
 over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction.
=20
 Thanks to all for thinking about this.

I think these are quite good...the missing piece, I would argue, that we need 
to include is a talking point on the need for FERC to focus significant 
resources on the identification and elimination of market power in 
electricity markets and the need to encourage the development of distributed 
generation and more effective demand - side response mechanisms , partly in 
response to market power concerns. This is a huge issue in  getting wholesale 
electricity markets to work effectively, i.e; to create discernable  consumer 
welfare benefits.... and we ( Enron ) need to talk about this this issue and 
concern and talk about it frequently and w/ the same passion we talk about 
the need for open markets.

Leslie asked me to forward this.  Summary of FERC staff testimony is in red.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : May 14, 2001
FERC Staff Finds Market Power Concerns in El Paso Case 
El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy probably exercised market 
power in the Southern California gas market and drove up gas prices over the 
past year when pipeline capacity constraints existed, FERC staff concluded 
last week in testimony before Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner 
Jr. 
At the same time Southern California Edison told FERC that El Paso caused a 
$3.7 billion increase in gas costs in California from March 2000 to March 
2001 by withholding capacity from the market and driving up the basis 
differentials between supply basins and California. Edison based its 
testimony on analysis by the Brattle Group. 
Meanwhile, El Paso countered with its own data arsenal and army of 
consultants. El Paso said the price increases were caused by unprecedented 
demand and inadequate supply infrastructure. Harvard University economics 
professor Joseph Kalt said on behalf of El Paso that the exorbitant gas 
prices were the result of a combination of supply and demand factors related 
to the electricity market and ultimately caused by decades of bad public 
policy decisions rather than El Paso's market power in the Southwest. 
FERC set the market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and 
ordered him to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, 
March 29). The Commission cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the 
bidding for capacity on its system during an open season in February 2000 to 
favor its affiliates. Critics alleged El Paso Merchant Energy Gas L.P. and El 
Paso Merchant Energy Co. ended up the big winners in the open season, snaring 
three contracts for 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California 
border, because they received inside information on a discount transportation 
rate. But in the order on complaint, the Commission said it found "no merit 
in the allegations." Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso 
violated its standards of conduct. However, the allegations that El Paso 
engaged in market and price manipulation were not dismissed. 
In his testimony last week, FERC economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded 
that under certain circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in 
the Southern California gas market. Its market position as measured by the 
Herfindahl-Herschman Index (HHI) exceeded levels deemed appropriate by FERC, 
the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, he said. 
When the state is considered as a single market, El Paso's market 
concentration and market share are "both within the safe harbor," he said. 
However, when there are capacity constraints in Southern California, as there 
were last summer and winter, and when El Paso's supplies include both firm 
and "nearly firm" gas, the HHI increases to 2,262, said Ogur. "This exceeds 
the 1,800 threshold for concern that sellers may possess market power. El 
Paso's market share rises to 45%, which exceeds the 35% threshold. 
"When pipeline constraints separate Southern California from Northern 
California, market concentration may be outside the safe harbor and El Paso's 
market share may be greater than the threshold," he said. 
Although about 1 Bcf/d of excess capacity may have existed in the Northern 
California market last summer, it's not clear that it was available to 
Southern California customers in sufficient quantities to constrain El Paso's 
market power, said Ogur. 
Ogur's testimony differs substantially from testimony submitted last week by 
John Morris for El Paso Merchant and testimony submitted by Lukens Consulting 
for El Paso Pipeline. Those studies defined the market in question as 
including all of California, while Ogur defined the relevant market as 
Southern California when pipeline constraints exist. 
The Brattle Study, which was submitted on behalf of Southern California 
Edison, concludes El Paso Merchant Energy was able to exercise market power 
through its control over 1.4 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Pipeline and 
Transwestern, but the study does not specifically define the market. It 
places an HHI of 2,179 for firm capacity held by El Paso Merchant on El Paso 
and Transwestern between the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and California. The 
Brattle study calculates El Paso's market share to be 34%, rising to 48% 
after adjusting for Southern California Gas' and PG&E's core capacity. 
The study fails, according to Ogur, by excluding capacity on other California 
pipes and storage space. It also attempts to find market power abuse by 
analyzing basis differentials that exceeded maximum tariff rates, but admits 
it is unable to determine if the abnormal basis differentials might have been 
caused instead by capacity constraints. It also can't deny the fact that 
interruptible transportation was available at maximum rates.

Steve,
	Here is the draft summary of Enron's ripple claims against
non-claimants (entities that are not seeking refunds in the PNW proceeding.)

	For illustrative purposes, we have used three different reference
prices:  (1) ISO; (2) Seattle; and (3) Tacoma.  We believe all three are
substantially flawed, but they give you a comparison to work with.  Please
let me know if you need more detail.

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request 
to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes 
examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. 

EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier 
this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR 
filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

I have updated the material I sent you yesterday to include information on 
expansion plans of Bonneville and PacifiCorp, the two biggest owners in the 
Northwest Power Pool.  (In the US portion of the pool, BPA has 50% of the 
investment, PacifiCorp about 25% and the remaining IOU's the other 25%.  The 
statement "Bonneville owns 80% of the transmission in the Northwest" is only 
true if you exclude Canada, most of Montana and Idaho, all of Wyoming, Utah 
and Nevada.)  Don't quote the data for PacifiCorp, since it is not final and 
publicly announced.  The Bonneville data is from public sources.

Below is the filing Enron made yesterday protesting Entergy Power Marketing's 
request to continue Market Based Rates.  Aquila and Dynegy also filed good 
protests.  I will separately email the charts that were attached to Enron's 
filing once I receive them later today.  

Also, Enron has filed (1) a protest of Entergy's request to require 
"ultimate" "Valid" source and sink (no sinks to generation only control 
areas) on all reservations and (2) comments on Entergy's proposed 
interconnection procedures and agreement (note: this was struck from FERC's 
agenda yesterday).  Let me know if you need copies of those two filings.

In preparation for the upcoming filings from different RTOs around the 
country to meet the FERC Order 2000 October 15 deadline, I'd like to outline 
a set of steps that we need to undertake to respond appropriately.  Comments 
are appreciated. 

A few people met with FERC last Friday to discuss our general observations 
and what a good RTO will look like (please see attached file below).

Not all RTOs intend to file on October 15.  The filing RTOs (from what I can 
tell) include the following: (1) RTO West, (2) Desert Star, (3) SPP, (4) 
Entergy, (5) Southern Transco, (6) Grid South, and (7) Florida RTO.  (SPP and 
Entergy may file together)

1. Immediate Public Response

It is critical to make sure that we have a list of key issues with each RTO 
filing that we can use to make public statements.  Each RTO lead should 
prepare  preliminary list of issues and send to Joe Hartsoe and me no later 
than Friday.  When the RTO filing is made, we need to review this list and 
compare to the actual filings and finalize.  This information will go into 
building our public message.  

Our initial response will be public (through the trade press).  This will 
include making specific comments about each RTO.

Right now we are focusing on (1) failed efforts and (2) insufficient work as 
the key problems.  Any details or other topics should be considered.

2. Formal Response to October 15 Filing

Dan Watkiss of B&P will be reviewing the formal filings for details.  Joe 
Hartsoe will coordinate our FERC filings due on November 15.  We need these 
done by early November to run them through the commercial side.  Each RTO 
lead should schedule some time in DC the week of Oct 24 with Joe Hartsoe to 
make sure that our filings are on-track and complete.

We should file in each RTO case.

3. E-trans Response

Jeff Brown continues to work to build our model.  No formal plan to roll this 
out has been yet developed.  We are working to have something ready by 
December 1.

4. Northeast Tight Pool Response

I would like Steve Montovano to take the lead to structure our response.  We 
heard at FERC that PJM was considering filing pretty soon (next week).  We 
need to get our story straight to take this to a pre-filing meeting at FERC.

Please see the attached memo from INGAA regarding a meeting they and Joe Hartsoe had with Dan Larcamp as a follow up to the meeting Rick, Linda and I had with Dan Larcamp a couple of weeks ago.  INGAA asks that we not circulate the memo widely.  

We need to discuss what, if any, response ENA needs to make.  Donna and I have been talking about this and we will set up a conference call with the gas group to discuss further.  Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 24, 2001
FERC's Wood Looking for a Few Good Executives 
Chairman designate Pat Wood III is looking for a few good energy executives to teach him and his FERC colleagues the ins and outs of the natural gas and electricity markets, specifically how to detect when something "smelly" is taking place. 
He's willing to pay a maximum salary of $133,700 -- which is what he'll be making as chairman -- for up to 10 executives who are interested in the task. That's the "top payment" that Congress will allow, Wood noted. He's also looking to hire an unspecified number of executives at a salary in the $115,000 range. Potential applicants should call him directly at (202) 208-0388, Wood said during an interview with NGI Thursday. 
"We've tried like crazy to get people. We can't compete on dollars...Government never competes on dollars. You got to get people who believe in this thing. There are people who want to do...something good for the [public]. I'm going to find those people," he noted, adding that this was a top priority with him. 
For interested executives, Wood said, "I'm going to give you the top [salary] I can pay you in the U.S. government, and I'm going to give you a helluva great workload in a critical industry that everybody in America depends on." 
He wants the executives to show him and the other four Commissioners "how it works." For example, "hedging and derivatives are great words" that are often tossed around, but Wood would like to know exactly how they work. "All five of us need to know everything about this business." 
Wood acknowledged that the new Market Observation Resource Center, which enables FERC to monitor the markets on a real-time basis throughout the day, has been a great addition at the Commission, but he says the agency needs people to decipher the data that it generates. "Getting the data is one thing, but having somebody that can assimilate that into something that tells you a story" is what FERC needs. 
He firmly believes that reported incidents of price manipulation and other market-power abuses will drop as the Commission's knowledge of the markets grows. "As we get smart on this, they won't try this stuff," Wood said, adding that it will "let them know [that] we're watching." 
Still, he admits that spotting price manipulation won't be easy for the Commission. "I think it's hard...even if you're really good at it."

FERC held its meeting today.  Big things happened.

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO "platform" to be used to form one 
RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO 
proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to 
participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance 
from outside consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to 
facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation 
must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  
The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, 
which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast 
RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for 
submitting a joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date 
(currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of 
weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip 
some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the 
Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort.  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

Subject: Allstom Esca Call Summary

For those of you who were unable to participate in the call here is a brief 
summary of the next steps.

Esca will put together a summary of additional issues and thoughts on the 
progression of the markets that I will distribute to you when it is received.

Esca received permission from PJM to disclose their name as the party that 
may be interested in staffing/operation of a market if there is not a ready 
or logical candidate to do so.  In addition, there was some interest 
expressed in being the flagship member of the team, subject to Enron's wishes 
and what other companies may participate in the group.  PJM still has a clear 
preference for LNP.

I am in the process putting together a second meeting to finalize what we 
want to see in the markets and whether to incorporate the Esca comments.  
Also, any possible overlaps in products and services would be discussed and 
who would be the best candidates to participate i.e. PJM, APX, CALPX, or 
others.

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM=01;ET    =01;=20
=01;

By Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20
overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh=
en=20
an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was=
=20
taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20
operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its=
=20
estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the=
=20
judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers=
=20
and the state over potential refunds last week.=20

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the=
=20
state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle=
d=20
arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a=20
potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'=
s=20
chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20
billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not=
=20
negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund=
s=20
due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700=
=20
million.=20

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun=
ds=20
and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20
municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through=
=20
the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi=
a=20
Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20
those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20

"We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said. "The refun=
d=20
amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market."=
=20


Resetting The Baseline=20


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the=
=20
ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f=
or=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition=
=20
to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news=
,=20
msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,=
=20
msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has=
=20
also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa=
ir=20
prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by=
=20
retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20
controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator=
=20
needed to meet demand each hour.=20

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne=
r=20
recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be=
=20
modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu=
ch=20
further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag=
e=20
of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20
recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20
considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou=
ld=20
cut potential refunds sharply.=20

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back =
as=20
Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about=
=20
one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20
Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May=
=20
2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20

"The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20
overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said. "We just=20
maintain that position."=20


FERC Baseline Questioned=20


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when=
=20
fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric=
e=20
cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have=
=20
been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20
demand.=20

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato=
rs=20
be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to=
=20
$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt=
=20
said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering=
=20
only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the=
=20
rewards for such withholding, he said.=20

"The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit us=
ed=20
would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,"=20
Hildebrandt said in an interview.=20

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between=
=20
actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and fo=
r=20
every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO=20
released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.=

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his=

numbers aren't justified.=20

"These are based on very tangible records," he said. "The idea that it's a=

Charles --

I fully agree that we must integrate the NERC plans and systems (or 
improvements to the NERC model) into our RTO model.  I hope that is something 
you can coordinate with the project as this develops.

Thx,

Jim

Subject: Re: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans  

Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures:

At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today, there was 
considerable discussion on how this Task Force (which was formed before the 
OASIS ANOPR was posted) would coordinate on an industry-wide basis, a NERC 
response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR.

Here are some important points a FERC Staff member (Marv Rosenberg) made at 
the meeting.  These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal 
and the process of getting buy-in in each of the Regions/RTOs.

-  FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing.  
-  The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order 2000 together with new OASIS II 
requirements
-  Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals.  
However a diversity of filings will indicate   non-consensus and FERC will 
make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly.

FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices 
standards for issuing in a NOPR.

FERC is looking for:
- more functionality and to be more user-friendly
- electronic scheduling
- electronic reservations
- reduce duplication of information entry for customers
- not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications 
 I asked Marv to clarify this - He explained that although not required, FERC 
welcomes propsals to address the control area   source/sink issues as part of 
an OASIS II solution (ie Entergy Source/Sink Order)

OASIS II should:
- continue use of Web browsers
-  use templates for file transfers (uploads and downloads)
- all displays do not have to look the same - but encourages a common look 
and feel
- within a RTO, business practicese may differ, but between RTOs the 
practices must be standardized

We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended 
to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus.  

The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buy-in an important 
element of our proposal.
If FERC adopts the NERC filing, we will likely be stuck with the exisiting 
contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC 
is not proposing any tariff changes.  Also we will not get the control area 
source/sink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in 
7 months.

Of course, another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task 
Force.

Subject: Transmission / Wholesale Market Regional Plans


1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
"off the shelf" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

SK - I printed this & put it & attachments in your meeting folder.  mm

Alan Comnes will fax to your attention the EIA reports on Wyoming.  Susan 
Landwehr has faxed to you Gov. Geringer's statement before Congress and other 
pertinent materials.  We are searching for a recent presentations by Belden 
in Santa Fe.  Attached is a presentation Tim made re:  power supply that is 
somewhat out of date--note date of 8/14/00.  



Sue Landwehr will also prepare a briefing paper for you on the Gov. including 
a summary of the positions he has taken recently at WGA and RGA functions.  

Attached is a presentation prepared by Steve Walton on transmission 
activities in the West.  While I did not present Steve's slides, I used them 
as an ouline for remarks I made at the last WGA meeting on transmission.  
Gov. Geringer participated in the meeting and appeared to agree with our 
approach for adding transmission in congested areas.



I've also attached a copy of a presentation put together by Jeff Dasovich on 
energy needs of the high tech industry.  He prepared these at your request 
last fall.  






Have a good weekend.

NOTE TO STEVE, RICK, JOE AND JIM -- ENRON CONTINUES TO HAVE ISSUES WITH 
INTERCONNECTION.  THE FERC STAFF INVESTIGATION ALSO SAID THAT INTERCONNECTION 
POLICY (OR LACK THEREOF) CAN BE USED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.  DO NOT NAME 
VEPCO, BUT THIS IS A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DISCUSS AT 
LUNCH.  The developers are working to fix this with VEPCO commercial people, 
so I have not been asked to call FERC yet.

---------
I discussed this with developer, Reagan Rorschach today.  Enron was working 
with VEPCO to site an IPP (Enron owned) in VEPCO.  We did not come to terms 
on the PPA this summer.  Enron would like to keep its ability to site the 
plant with the associated queue position.  VEPCO basically has "tied" our 
queue position to a PPA with VEPCO and, therefore, kicked Enron out of the 
queue when we did not execute a PPA.

VEPCO recently filed interconnection procedures with FERC that have not been 
approved yet (these procedures were not in place when we got in the 
queue--there were only very general "ask to interconnect" procedures then).  
The only place that any "milestones" are mentioned is in the Interconnection 
Agreement (which, of course, VEPCO and Enron never executed).  In addition, a 
generator can lose its queue stop for "material changes" to the project.  
Several parties protested this very loose terminology, but we do not know 
what FERC will say.  By way of comparison, Consumers recently filed 
procedures that state "material changes" mean increases in MWs > 15% or 
increasing the in service date by more than 6 months.  This issue will be 
significant because if we get our queue spot back (which I think we should), 
we may change the configuration (or a purchaser could change).  I think that 
reductions in MWs or more stable configurations should not be considered 
"material changes."  Reagan is going to speak with the commercial VEPCO 
people and I'll call their attorney if necessary.

In any event, this again is an example of the kind of problems independent 
generators continue to face until FERC establishes some general procedures or 
an interconnection rulemaking.

Subject: Interconnection Issues

Sarah and Christi--

I have been working with Jeffrey Keenan and Reagan Rorschack on a power plant 
in NC.  This plant is in the VEPCO service territory, and so they want to 
interconnect with VEPCO.  Originally, they were working on a PPA with VEPCO, 
but this PPA fell apart in October.  VEPCO now claims that because the deal 
fell apart, our plant should be removed from the queue.

If we are removed from the queue, we will fall behind a 640 MW plant in the 
same area of northern NC.  This is of great concern to the developers because 
they are afraid that there will be no move available transmission in this 
area of the grid.  

They are looking at a number of possible avenues of recourse.  They have 
started to talk with me regarding handling this on a state level with the NC 
PSC.  But, I think that this is probably a federal issue.

Do you think that this should be handled on a federal level or on the state 
level?  Please let me know ASAP.  Thank you.

Tom Chapman



IF you need more information, let me know.

On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma 
interconnection agreement ("IA") and procedures subject to modification.  As 
I mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in 
Enron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's 
loss of generation.

All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not 
included with an interconnection request.
Entergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve 
wholesale, as well as unbundled retail.
Dismisses EPSA's call for a "model" and approves Entergy's pro forma 
interconnection agreement, subject to modification.
Agreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid 
to Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other 
aspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are 
responsible for their own negligence).
Holds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the 
IA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions.
Clarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another 
generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot 
accommodate "receipt" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay 
costs of expansion.
Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions 
are pure "interconnection" and which are applicable when 
transmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS).
Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a 
specific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide 
a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an 
explanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines).
If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the 
unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide.
FERC will not initiate a "generic" proceeding at this time, but encourages 
all transmission providers to file procedures at FERC.
Approves Entergy's credits for "optional" upgrades (required to transport 
power away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of 
how the credits work.
Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent 
studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more 
intent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to 
execute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may 
be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This 
is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also 
post its queue on OASIS.
Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating.
Entergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are 
$10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies).
Per Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency 
(or explain why that is inappropriate).
Per Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator 
pays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system.

Entergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you 
would like a copy of the order.

Subject: Comments on FERC November 1 order

For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of "spot" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.

A procedural order issued late last night on the Staff Investigation in the 
California market.  A special FERC Commission meeting will be held November 1 
to consider a draft order on remedies.  The Commission will also issue the 
staff investigation report.  Thereafter, comments are due within three weeks 
to supplement the record or comment on the Commission's proposed remedies.  
On November 9, the Commission will hold a public conference to discuss 
proposed remedies.  Based on the full record then, the FERC expects to issue 
an order directing remedies by the end of the year.

Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Note Tim's question about handicapping 
the liklihood of approval.  Prices will move in the West based on these 
odds.  We need to have a better view than anyone else.

Subject: Re: ISO Market Stabilization Plan  

Tim,  although there's always a "chance" my impression is that the FERC won't 
buy the ban on exports, as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce 
Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish 
with their own Order 888 and 2000 initiatives.  I am less certain about the 
direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized 
stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants.  

The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is 
unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term.  If 
they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include 
the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this 
"fast" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in 
court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending 
entirely on the circumstances.

Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this.  Ray

Subject: ISO Market Stabilization Plan

The recent plan filed at FERC is horrible.  The two most aggregious parts are 
the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports.  I know that we are 
commenting on this proposal.  I am also looking for intellegence on whether 
the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC.  If it is not 
approved by FERC, what can the Californians do?  California has ignored FERC 
before.  If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the 
likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene?  If you hear anything on this 
matter please keep me posted.  The proposed plan will have a huge impact on 
the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO.

Some positive aspects for EPMI:

States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has "theoretical 
merit", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages 
consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other 
systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is 
seated and given its approval.

SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY 
REGULATION 





Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Jean Carnahan, D-Mo., have asked the 
General Accounting Office (GAO) to inquire into whether the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure 
that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and 
that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to 
customers. "Under federal law, FERC has the responsibility to ensure just
and 
reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission," the Senators said 
in a letter to GAO, "but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have 
fulfilled this role in the California situation." Following is text of the 
letter: 

April 12, 2001 

Mr. David M. Walker 
Comptroller General of the United States 
U.S. General Accounting Office 
441 G Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20548 

Dear Mr. Walker: 

We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers
sporadic 
rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout

the western United States, a situation that may get worse this summer when 
the demand for electricity increases. We understand that there are many 
factors that have contributed to the current situation, and few short term 
options to create more electricity for this market. At the same time we are 
extremely troubled that California's Independent System Operator (ISO) 
recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly

been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the 
electricity, an overcharge amounting to $6.8 billion according to the 
operator. Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a 
non-functioning market that has, in turn, exacerbated the state's
electricity 
shortage.With the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in 
additional states such as Missouri, we are concerned whether there is 
adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power 
by suppliers. Without such oversight, the nation may not progress towards 
achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation: lower consumer 
prices, greater reliability, increased choice, and more efficient
generation. 
Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the 
oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission (PSC), which

works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity 
or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates, to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under federal law, FERC has the 
responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale

transmission, but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have
fulfilled 
this role in the California situation. FERC Commissioner William Massey 
recently said: "Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets 
requires that we clearly define market power, and aggressively intervene
when 
the markets are not producing reasonable prices. The commission's actions to

date have been insufficient." (March 20, 2001 testimony to the House Energy 
Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Air quality).We are requesting that 
the General Accounting Office (GAO) assess whether FERC is properly 
exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates. Specifically,
we 
ask GAO to answer the following questions: 

1) Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates? Is 
FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its
statutes 
power supply, demand, and pricing in California? In other Western states? In

the Central Midwest and in the Northeast? 

2) Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight 
obligations in a timely and effective manner? And does FERC have the 
necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role? 

3) Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring 
just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now

occurring in so many states? 

4) As we understand the situation from some experts, the number of 
transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market 
place is voluminous. This situation may increase the difficulties of
guarding 
against market abuse. Is there a role for another agency or independent 
organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these 
transactions? If so, what would be an appropriate oversight role? 

5) We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices 
relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market 
would help guard against market abuses. We understand the need to keep
prices 
confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion. After this 
appropriate period of time has passed, would greater transparency be 
beneficial? 

We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public 
Utility Commission (CPUC) that market power has been abused in the 
transmission of natural gas, which has in turn contributed to the spiraling 
cost of electricity generation in the state. The CPUC maintains that the 
price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been
manipulated 
so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times 
the national average. Because an increasing number of states, including 
California, rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants, any manipulation

of that commodity can have severe consequences. Additionally, because such a

large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural 
gas, we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have 
even more profound effects. Therefore, we ask GAO to answer the following 
questions: 

1) Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate

pipelines? If not, what areas require improvement? 

2) Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to 
the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines? Should
this 
role be enhanced or clarified, and if so, how? 

3) Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other
parts 
of the country, aside from California, where the natural gas pipeline 
capacity is similarly limited? Please provide any details.We appreciate all 
the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,J 

oseph I. Lieberman 
Jean Carnahan

I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an 
ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance 
because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a 
region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, 
reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between 
ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the 
grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to 
participate.  

Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC 
performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short 
parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the 
long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation 
price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of 
power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC 
settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential.

The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is 
voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC.

Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics?

I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to 
show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing 
it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, 
orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5.  

Anyone disagree?

given an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for 
ballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR 
meetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC 
concerns.  

In addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP 
Executive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support 
for what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to 
make a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by 
an entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very 
quickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support 
reliability.

If Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets 
discuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive 
Board action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant 
conditional certification of our two control areas in 
ECAR.                    thanx

ECAR has filed a Section 205 request for Commission approval of an 
"Inadvertent Settlement Tariff."  The Tariff is intended to obligate each 
Party to make payment and to entitle each Party to receive compensation for 
Inadvertent Interchange from each other Party pursuant to ECAR's Inadvertent 
Settlement Procedure.  Parties to the settlement include Allegheny Power 
(Monongahela Power Company, The Potomac Edison Company, and West Penn Power 
Company), American Electric Power Co., Big Rivers Electric Corp., Cinergy 
Corp., Consumers Energy Co., The Dayton Power and Light Co., The Detroit 
Edison Co., Duquesne Light Co., East Kentucky Power Cooperative, Inc., 
FirstEnergy Corp., Hoosier Energy REC, Indianapolis Power and Light Co., LG&E 
Energy Corp., Northern Indiana Public Service Co., Ohio Valley Electric 
Corp., and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co.

I will let you know when this gets noticed.

The Commission at today's FERC meeting voted out orders in the three 
Southeast region RTOs - Grid South, SETrans and SPP.  It was reported at the 
meeting that the orders will find that it is necessary for a single Southeast 
region RTO.  A separate order will be issued in a new docket RT01-100 
initiating mediation before an ALJ (Judge Bobbie McCartney) to facilitate the 
formation of the single Southeast RTO.  Within one week, the settlement 
proceeding will begin and will continue for 45 days.  The judge thereafter 
must report to the Commission within 10 days including an outlline of a 
Southeastern RTO, milestones for completion of intermediate steps and a 
deadline for submitting a joint proposal.  The Commission will review the 
report and may issue further orders as needed.  

Grid South, SE Trans and SPP are required to participate and Grid Florida is 
encouraged to participate in the mediation.  All parties to any of these RTOs 
should also participate.

The Grid South order will also include language requiring an independent 
board.  After the independent board is established, it should choose an 
operator of the RTO.  This language should further support the idea set out 
in a prior SPP order granting Enron's clarification that the RTO should not 
make major capital expenditures for software or operating systems prior to 
the establishment of an independent board.

The Grid South order should also include language supporting the 
establishment of interconnection standards.

This afternoon the Commission has issued an Order Requesting Comments in the 
SDG&E and LA Dept. of Water & Power petition proceedings on the short term 
capacity release price cap (RP01-180, RP01-222).

The order requests comments on "whether...[to] reimpose the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into California and the 
effects of such action on the California gas market."  Order and attachment 
are attached at the bottom of this email.  Print to read all footnotes 
(original came in WordPerfect).

Note that in footnote 2, the order explains the current comprehensive 
Commission approach to the gas market in California, and that they're 
reaching out for the gray market:  "On May 18, 2001, in Docket No. 
RM01-9-000, the Commission issued an order proposing to impose certain 
reporting requirements on natural gas sellers and transporters serving the 
California market.  The proposed reporting requirements are intended to 
provide the Commission with the necessary information to determine what 
action, if any, it should take within its jurisdiction.  Our order today 
coupled with our May 18 order continues to focus on issues related to natural 
gas prices in California and actions we may take to address capacity release 
transactions and bundled sales (i.e., the "gray market")."

To note in this order, the discussion includes an explanation that FERC 
Staff's analysis of capacity release data between Nov. 2000 and April 2001 
shows that only .09 to 1.2 percent of the volume of capacity releases into CA 
were above the maximum tariff rate.  In light of this information, the order 
requests comment on whether the price cap into California would be reimposed 
on short term releases prior to Sept. 30, 2002.

Comments are due in  20 days.  Questions asked in the order are:  (1) Would 
reimposition of the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release 
transactions into California have any significant effect on the price of gas 
at the California border; (2) Should the reimposition of the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions be limited to California 
or extended to pipelines delivering into the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) region; (3) What effect do capacity release transactions have 
on wholesale electric prices; (4) What would be the effect of reimposing the 
maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into 
California given firm shippers' ability to make bundled sales at the 
California border; and (5) How will reimposing the maximum rate ceiling for 
short-term capacity release transactions into California impact shippers' 
ability to obtain short-term firm capacity.

An excel attachment to the order details the Staff findings on Transportation 
Release Transactions above the max. rate Nov. 2000 - April 2001

The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the Commiss=
ion this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, effective =
statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's recommendation.  I=
 was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which Dan Watkiss and=
 I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the following high points=
:=20

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally inapp=
ropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge shoul=
d formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order =
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and af=
ter October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just th=
e State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these mar=
kets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the metho=
dology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR.=20

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was=
 receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 met=
hodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this s=
hould be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form p=
art of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive=
 refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should b=
e subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund me=
thodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he fel=
t that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter=
 was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises were =
made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this insight w=
ill shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to recommend plac=
ing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 order with =
its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, although h=
e did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge tol=
d us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and t=
hat the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is lik=
ely that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a=
 fast track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolv=
ed issues of material fact".  The scope of the hearing has not been determi=
ned, but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle fo=
r marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

In preparation for the Commissioner meetings later this week,  attached is a copy of the most recent version of the Show Cause Motion.  I am still working on it -- I want to beef up the section on entities already in an ISO/RTO, but you'll have an idea of the concepts we're developing.

Although we do not want to share a copy of the pleading with the Commissioners yet, we thought you should see where we're going on the Motion.  Please call me with questions.

Steve, Lou's write up is attached.  The issues accepted have the effect of 
"bookending" the issue of the native load exception.  On the one end, the 
states argue that FERC has no jurisdiction to impose open access on 
transmission (bundled or unbundled) that is associated with the providers' 
native load service.  On the other end, Enron argues that FERC has 
jurisdiction over all transmission and it was error for FERC not to exercise 
that jurisdiction once it had concluded that to do so was needed to eliminate 
undue discrimination.

Joe Hartsoe deserves a lot of credit in being persistent on this because, had 
Enron not petitioned, there is a scenario in which the Court would consider 
only the negative side of the issue:  Was FERC authorized to do even the 
little that it did?

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: 03/13/01

RE: Summary of the FERC Staff Recommendation on California
      Market Monitoring and Mitigation and EPSA Comment
      Outline

Pursuant to its December 15, 2000 Order (EL00-95-000) (December Order), FERC 
released its Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and 
Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market (Report), 
issued March 9th, addressing mitigation of price volatility in the California 
markets.  Comments on the Report are due on Thursday, March 22nd.  The 
following is a summary of the Report, along with an outline of possible EPSA 
comments.  We will discuss the report and EPSA's comments further on our 
weekly Power Marketers conference call.  To access the call, dial 
1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any 
questions, please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or  
eperrigo@epsa.org.

Report Summary

Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five 
percent of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and 
forward markets, the Report immediately notes that "ultimately the real 
solution to California's problems lies in increased investments in 
infrastructure."

The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a real-time auction 
with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic 
withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of 
scarcity:

(1) Coordinating and Controlling Outages -  The ISO should coordinate and 
approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator 
Agreement (PGA) with the ISO.  Coordination and outage control procedures 
should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review 
should be expedited.  Similarly, the ISO should closely monitor unplanned 
outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation.

(2) Selling Obligations - All capacity that is available and not scheduled to 
run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the real-time market  - this 
obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO day-ahead 
markets.  PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity 
for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to 
calculate marginal costs, such as heat rate.  FERC Staff would then use this 
data, in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to 
determine a price that the ISO would use pre-determined to mitigate prices 
during times of reserve deficiency.  Load Serving Entities should also be 
required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be 
curtailed.

(3) Price Mitigation - When called upon to provide the available and 
unscheduled capacity as mentioned above, PGA unit prices would be mitigated 
in hours when there is a reserve deficiency, or Stage 3 emergencies (the 
Report notes that it is "these hours which are extremely conducive to the 
exercise of market power by suppliers") and will be obligated to sell 
capacity in real-time at the marginal cost of the highest-priced PGA until 
called upon to run.

(4) Real-time Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit - all generating 
units should have a standing, confidential price based on its marginal 
costs.  This price will be used by the ISO to establish the real-time market 
clearing price when mitigation is appropriate.  Staff believes that a single 
market clearing price auction design is appropriate, thus reversing the 
recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order.

(5) Market Clearing Price - All real-time energy offers should be paid the 
applicable market clearing price.

(6) Conditions for Invoking Mitigation - Mitigation measures should only be 
applied to critical operating periods, such as emergencies.

As noted in the Report, Staff recognizes that there are potential 
difficulties in implementing the proposal, and that "there are no easy 
answers to the current problems in the California market."  Among the 
purported difficulties, Staff notes implementation problems with bidding 
obligations on imported power, incentive effects on load scheduling, 
treatment of purchased power, mitigating prices during emergencies, and 
setting a price component for scarcity.

Suggested EPSA Comments

EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal, however there are a few 
things we commend.  Namely:  (1) the Staff's timely turnaround of the report, 
as directed in the December Order; (2) their admission that the overarching 
problem cannot be solved by these shorter-term mitigation measures, only by 
increased investments in infrastructure; and (3) recommendation of the single 
price auction in the real-time market, noting that it should be used for only 
approximately five percent of the market.  Also, to stress the importance of 
regulatory certainty, the Report recommends a date-certain "sunset" for the 
mitigation approach of no more than one year.

Areas of concern include:

(1) It is not acceptable to use a cost-based model to explain what happens to 
prices in a shortage period.  The oil shortages of the 1970s are a good 
illustration - a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first 
quadrupling of oil prices from about $3 to $12 per barrel.  Similarly, prices 
rose to $42 in 1980 with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply.

(2) Staff's proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not 
create a market clearing price in scarcity situations, and does not take into 
account the customer's value of the commodity.  To the extent seller's costs 
are used, full costs are not included Staff's recommendation.  As outlined in 
EPSA's recently filed white paper on market monitoring, full costs should 
include opportunity costs, scarcity value, capacity value, and risk.

(3) The Report fails to link high prices to any anti-competitive behavior, 
yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report.

(4) EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the real-time market as 
recommended.  This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business 
decisions and retards the healthy development of the market.

(5) The Report's method for calculating the market clearing price is not 
illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing 
price.  The method proposed in FERC's refund order of March 9th may be 
preferable to the method proposed in this Report.  Staff's method only 
includes participating generators and does not include imports, and 
out-of-market purchases.  EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of 
details and characteristics of a true market.

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B     
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM ET      
 

By Mark Golden 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion when an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week. 

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers and the state over potential refunds last week. 

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been called arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes "a potential framework for settlement discussions," Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO's chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC. 

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refunds due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700 million. 

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refunds and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed. 

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the California Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of those purchases, the ISO made estimates. 

"We know the volume (of the bilateral deals)," Hildebrandt said. "The refund amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market." 


Resetting The Baseline 


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law for California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition to sales to the California Department of Water Resources. 

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fair prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator needed to meet demand each hour. 

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagner recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be modified when used retroactively to determine refunds. 

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds much further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly average of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices would cut potential refunds sharply. 

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back as Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown. 

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May 2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. 

"The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the overcharges going back to May should be repaid," McCorkle said. "We just maintain that position." 


FERC Baseline Questioned 


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the price cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet demand. 

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generators be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said. 

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to $7.7 billion from $6.1 billion. 

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the rewards for such withholding, he said. 

"The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit used would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect," Hildebrandt said in an interview. 

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and for every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares. 

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his numbers aren't justified. 

"These are based on very tangible records," he said. "The idea that it's a black box is misleading."

FERC held its meeting today.  Big things happened.

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO "platform" to be used to form one RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance from outside consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date (currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort.  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolved 
issues of material fact".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source 
and sink filing.

TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating 
that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to 
the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly 
talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members "predisposed to 
Enron's point of view."  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests 
to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.  
Finally, TVA understands that "Enron has prevented SERC" from bringing the 
matter to NERC ADR.

Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and 
sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically 
states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have 
known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them 
on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons 
why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the 
reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability 
until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of 
listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system 
(although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, 
I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy 
also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in 
case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often 
does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to 
check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of 
timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even 
analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the 
tags now), Entergy says this is "irrelevant", but TLRs will be improved.

Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that "EPSA has not made a compelling 
argument that disclosure would harm liquidity."  I think that the compelling 
arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC 
approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them 
and the tags don't require them.

Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar 
information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even 
so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it 
inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.)

Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in "anticipated" source and 
sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding 
that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the 
power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority.

We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the 
reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material 
issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least.

USA:
UPDATE 1-FERC adopts plan to monitor Calif. power market.
By Patrick Connole and Tom Doggett

04/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - A split U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize California's volatile
power market and stem market abuses.

Under the plan, set to take effect in late May and last for one year, price
relief measures will be imposed on California's wholesale power sales during
severe energy shortages.
The three-member commission split sharply on the plan, voting 2-1 for an order
that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control
in California this summer.

Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year, the
result of growing demand from the state's 34 million residents following a
decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system.

FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a Republican, and Democrat Linda Breathitt
supported the order. Democrat William Massey dissented despite 10 hours of
talks aimed at reaching a consensus.

"California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive
to their problems, and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive
necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or
undemine longer-term solutions," Hebert said.

DISSENTING VOTE

Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies,
FERC's actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the
California market.

"The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. Now is not the time for half-a-loaf solutions," Massey said.

Under the plan, price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California
Independent System Operator (ISO) declares a power emergency.

The ISO, which manages most of the state's power grid, uses a three-stage
alert system, with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven
percent of actual demand on the grid.

As demand eats further into the supply cushion, Stage Two and Stage Three
alerts are declared, with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be
required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread
outages.

California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year, with
state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air
conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak.

FINDING A FAIR PRICE

The mitigation and monitoring plan's central element will require generators
to offer available power in real time using a "proxy" price established a day
ahead of actual delivery, FERC said.

The proxy price reflects the "marginal cost of the highest-cost generator"
asked to supply power to the grid.

This price will vary daily according to demand, the price of fuel used by
generators - such as natural gas - and the cost of complying with
environmental standards.

However, generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify
the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records, which they are required
to submit at the end of each month. If those costs cannot be justified, FERC
can order the generator to refund the buyer.

FERC said all generators in California, even those not subject to the
commission's price regulations, are required to sell into the ISO's real time
price market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission
lines.

Hydro-electric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their
generation limitations, which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the
competing needs of others for those same water resources.

REGIONAL SOLUTION

The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply
problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response.

Toward this goal, FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a
regional transmission organization (RTO) by June 1, or forfeit the so-called
crutch of FERC's price-relief plan.

Among the many measures contained in the order, FERC told California utilities
to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to
ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times.

The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into
possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western
region.

FERC said the plan would expire in 2002 as the California power crisis eases.
The state's rush to build new power plants is expected to put an additional
4,000 to 6,000 megawatts on the grid by next summer, enough to supply up to
six million homes.

   Bush Comments About Taiwan Causes Stir

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - President Bush's bold comments about Taiwan
provoked quick reactions of concern Thursday in Asia, where a war
between China and Taiwan could devastate the region. Bush told The
Associated Press on Wednesday that U.S. military force is "certainly an
option" if China strikes Taiwan. He later said that America has an
obligation to defend Taiwan if China attacks. China had no immediate
comment about Bush's comments, and Taiwan's Foreign Ministry was also
silent.
   Grafts Can Restore Sexual Function

   DANA POINT, Calif. (AP) - Salvaging a nerve from the ankle, surgeons
have found they can rewire the penis so men achieve erections and have
sex after operations to remove their cancerous prostate glands. Doctors
say the nerve grafts are not as good as the original nerves, but they do
allow some men to regain sexual function when they otherwise would be
undoubtedly left impotent. "It seems to have promise, certainly over
doing nothing," said Dr. Joseph J. Disa, a plastic surgeon who performs
the surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

   Africa Ministers OK AIDS Drugs Plan

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) - African ministers agreed on a draft declaration
Wednesday calling on their countries to import and produce their own
generic AIDS drugs and to boost spending dramatically on AIDS programs
to fight the pandemic. African heads of state are expected to sign the
document Thursday at the start of a two-day pan-African summit on AIDS,
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. Governments will then be
asked to ratify the agreement in their respective legislative chambers.

   South Pole Rescue Is Made

   PUNTA ARENAS, Chile (AP) - A rescue plane completed the perilous
first leg of flight home from the South Pole, carrying an ailing
American doctor across Antarctica before landing at a base near the
coast. The propeller plane carrying Dr. Ronald Shemenski, who is
suffering from a gall bladder ailment, flew from the U.S. base at the
pole to Rothera research station in just over eight hours. "They've
landed safely," said Valerie Carroll of U.S.-based Raytheon Polar
Services, which organized the airlift.

   Calif. Energy Prices Limited

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal energy regulators Wedneday directed limited
price controls on California's wholesale electricity markets, but the
order fell short of the sweeping price caps California officials have
wanted. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted 2-1 to order that
wholesale prices be capped in California when electricity reserves fall
below 7.5 percent, triggering an emergency alert by power grid managers.

   Bush Debuts As Fund-Raiser-In-Chief

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - President Bush stepped out as the GOP's
fund-raiser in chief tonight, headlining an Arkansas dinner that netted
at least $700,000 for a key political ally, Sen. Tim Hutchinson. "I'm
here for one simple reason: This man needs to be returned back to the
United States Senate come election 2002," Bush told hundreds of donors.
Bush spoke largely about his own tax-reduction proposals, which he cast
as a matter of fairness.

   Problems Delay Space Station's Arm

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Computer trouble prevented astronauts
from steering the international space station's new giant robot arm with
a 1 1/2 -ton load Wednesday and resulted in a cascade of other woes.
Communication between the space station and Mission Control was
disrupted, and the orbiting outpost was left to fly on autopilot. In
addition, an orbit-raising maneuver by the docked space shuttle
Endeavour was put on hold.

   Feds: Airlines Fly Too Much

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Aviation Administration reported
Wednesday that so many flights have been scheduled at certain airports
that there is no way all of those planes can take off or land on time.
The problem is so acute at eight airports that at least three of every
100 takeoffs or landings are delayed by more than 15 minutes. At
LaGuardia, 16 percent of all takeoffs and landings were delayed last
year, more than any other airport, FAA statistics show. Newark was
second, at 8 percent, followed by O'Hare with 6 percent.

   Tokyo Stocks Rise

   TOKYO (AP) - Tokyo stocks rose in early trading Thursday as the
Nikkei rose 141.43 points to 13,968.93 points.

   Bucks 103, Magic 96

   MILWAUKEE (AP) - Fired up by a flagrant foul from Andrew DeClercq,
Ray Allen scored a personal playoff-best 27 points as the Bucks beat
Orlando 103-96 Wednesday night and took a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five
series. Tracy McGrady scored 35 points, but just five in the fourth
quarter as the Magic, trying to be more physical than finesse, lost for
the 11th straight time to Milwaukee.

24OEC/???WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission on Wednesday approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state
system combining the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific
Northwest.

U.S. regulators and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham believe RTO West is a
step forward in addressing reliability issues in the region. The federally
owned Bonneville Power Administration is one of the utilities in the RTO
design.
An RTO is an organization that manages a bulk electricity transmission system.
RTOs are expected to play a greater role in maintaining the nation's power
grid as markets deregulate.

As part of the approval for RTO West, the commission also accepted a proposal
from some of the utilities to form a transmission company (TRANSCO) to operate
within the broader RTO West.

The FERC asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year
on its plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its
operations in a broader regional system.

RTO West first submitted its plans to the FERC last October. It includes nine
electric utilities serving eight western states with some 50,000 miles of
transmission lines.

The nine are Avista , BPA, Idaho Power , Montana Power , Nevada Power ,
PacifiCorp , Portland General Electric , Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific

Subject: FERC in the News: FERC Orders Limited California Price Controls


FERC Orders Limited California Price Controls
By Rebecca Smith

  Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration
than to the urgings of Gov. Gray Davis and other California politicians,
a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited
price controls for the state's flawed electricity market. The new
controls aren't likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this
summer.

   The order was approved in a meeting that began 10 hours late, as the
three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to
restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of California's big
utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the state's fiscal
health.
   The commission built on a staff recommendation, issued in March, that
suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in
shortest supply. In its order, the commission decided to intervene
whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels --
so-called Stage I, II and III emergencies.

   The price-mitigation plan appears to ignore evidence, filed by the
grid-operating California Independent System Operator, that generators
can substantially raise market prices even when supplies aren't
technically short. The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when
individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair
production costs.

   Commissioner William Massey dissented, in part, from the order in a
sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadn't done its
duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge.
As a consequence, he said, the "economic carnage" is spreading
throughout the West.

   Mr. Massey, an Arkansas Democrat, criticized the commission for
acting only when electricity reserves fall below 7%, "since this agency
is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours."

   Under the order, generators will be required to submit cost data to
justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity. They will be
allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesn't exceed the
price charged by the oldest, least-efficient plant operating at the
time. Such "proxy price" methodology enabled plant owners to collect as
much as $470 per megawatt hour in February or roughly 12 times the
prevailing price a year earlier.

   Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert, a
Mississippi Republican, who said he didn't intend the commission to fall
into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that "we hinder
efforts" to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly
needed to correct California's supply-and-demand imbalance.

   Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat, was the swing vote who
eventually sided with Mr. Hebert. FERC staffers said she expressed
doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should. In
the meeting she acknowledged the "complexity" and "difficulty" of the
task but said she remained "steadfast in my belief that market solutions
. . . are preferable" to regulatory controls.

   The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order, saying
the price-cap scheme will be revoked June 1 unless the California grid
operator has filed a plan to become part of a region-wide grid-operating
organization. California's ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got
yanked when a new board, named by the state's governor, took control
recently. In recent months, Mr. Davis has urged increased isolationism,
even suggesting the state no longer export power.It isn't clear whether
FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a
stand-alone grid-running organization. More likely, it will be expected
to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to
operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner. The commission
gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid
operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would
include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power
Administration, the biggest power marketer and transmission owner in the
Northwest. Geographically, it would be the biggest regional grid
organization in the United States.

As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these issues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond.  

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welcome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lead" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and producing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues.  

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some areas, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR process must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also be responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments are due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.  
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

01/07/04/MN186091.DTL =20
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal re=
gulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly impos=
ed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of bla=
ckouts in the two states.=20
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling black=
outs yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackout=
s in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduc=
e air conditioning.=20
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take =
a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revis=
ions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during s=
hortages.=20
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for t=
he California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of =
dollars to keep the state's lights on.=20
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.=20
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet =
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat=
es during periods of high demand.=20
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the ex=
pense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electrici=
ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said=
 Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e=
nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =
no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont=
rols are in effect.=20
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=
t having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when =
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab=
out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, =
a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee=
s the state's power network.=20
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after=
 Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting=
 heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li=
ghts.=20
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=
t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th=
ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had=
 in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti=
al for unintended consequences."=20
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=
- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin=
g, under capped prices.=20
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=
2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because=
 of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=
ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.=
=20
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t=
hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal=
 regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit=
hhold output.=20
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"=
 said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=
 that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal r=
egulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let suppl=
y and demand determine costs.=20
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac=
k on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu=
mber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge=
ncies.=20
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."=20
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the com=
mission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for wh=
en the commission might come up with a response.=20

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, ge=
nerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state wa=
s nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the =
first time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
 table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
 uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy =
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for =
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=
=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca=
lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll=
ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia=
ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark=
et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p=
rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A=
nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap =
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind=
 of certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark=
ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s=
tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou=
ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=
ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=
lant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Indepen=
dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When =
there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=
ished during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=
rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent=
 of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=
ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=
ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=
ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou=
t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s=
ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev=
eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af=
ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su=
pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif=
ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat=
e's electricity since January.
     At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us t=
hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going=
 to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s=
ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m=
eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since =
May 31.
     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=
nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=
mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=
es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
 grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=
ntly drove away sellers, Hart said.
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
 the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=
ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=
 backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
 Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=
 of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =
a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=
ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=
en it should take effect. They got no answer.
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=
ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=
uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=
t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=
ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=
tely.
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =

Rick, Linda and I met with Dan Larcamp (Director of FERC's Office of Markets, 
Tariffs and Rates) yesterday.  He made several comments of interest:

Enron's Position on Market Structure

Dan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like "PJM."  Dan would 
like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his 
staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:  

 - what brings liquidity
 - what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end 
use customers -- how does    liquidity benefit consumers?
 - why do we support PJM over New York and New England
 - what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right 
signals to generators of where to site 


Gas Pipeline Issues

Dan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He 
said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree 
that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said 
he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want 
to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if 
pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through 
options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this 
provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  

Regulatory Gap

Dan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and 
the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily 
bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We 
discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still 
concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.

He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or 
staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has 
been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat 
defensive in response to those comparisons.

Open Access

Dan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up 
will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in 
the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention 
California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get 
California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC 
needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not 
be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.

EPSA 

Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are 
most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed 
concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for 
the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the 
Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result 
(lower prices).

Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he 
and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like 
to visit with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the 
foregoing.

Update:  Based on Charles' great MRD presentation to Power Trading, the 
traders have some ideas about this.  I'll provide more info as soon as I get 
it from them.

Subject: Re: OATI may have bids/offers on MRD  

We need to determine whether Enron should work toward a bulletin board for 
MRD on Enron Online if OATI is already working on one.  If so, we would need 
to act quickly in order to compete with OATI for the summer (if we even want 
to do that since OATI had a very good tagging agent that Enron's tagging 
system really didn't compete with).  OATI already has the online auctioneer 
and is working on adding the MRD bids/offers.  

Also, if Enron Online wants Enron in the middle of every transaction as a 
sleeve (unlike a third party bid/offer platform), then we need to consider 
that since all MRD transactions are physical, this will add to the FERC costs 
that Enron will pay (at least until we get a final rule from FERC on costs).  
Additionally, the market may not take to MRD as well if Enron is the sleeve 
on all transactions.

Subject: Re: OATI may have bids/offers on MRD  

The OATI folks have been pretty cose to the NERC MRD activities.  

I have provided Nelson Mueller (OATI) with some thoughts on how to simplify 
the MRD set-up process.  (This involves the steps marketers must perform to 
figure out what generation and how much is needed for redispatch.)

I knew that OATI has been responsive to facilitating the MRD procedures in 
the ETAG software and were interested in being a bulletin board for the bids 
and offers.  However, would OATI provide more than just a bulletin board?  I 
suspect they will not back up these products financially llike Enron OnLine 
could.

Additionally, NSP's generator marketer has asked me if our traders would be 
interested in a "contracted one-stop" MRD service utilizing NSP's uncommitted 
reserve generation capability.  These units are on the "good" side of the 
Eau-Claire Arpin interface in MAPP/MAIN.  I will offer this in my 
presentation tomorrow to the traders.

Charles--The OATI group was here today to teach EPMI about the OATI products 
that we are using.  OATI said that it is investigating whether to implement a 
generation bid/offer service platform on OATI.  Charles--Any thoughts?  

Note:  The fact that Enron has contracted with OATI for services is 
"confidential."

This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.  Alan 
Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a 
summary that we could provide him.  Zaremberg is convinced that no one in 
California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.  If 
we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing 
it to Zaremberg?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

I thought that this paper might be of interest  given the topic of our

haven't read it, but I know that the author is very well  respected in the

Here is a first  publishable draft.? This has benefited greatly from comments 
by Richard,  Judy, and of course Dan, but wcp takes full responsibility.
?
Careful further  review by all is needed.? I can identify two basic problems: 
the repeated  statistics for use of the grids are believed to be about right, 
but we lack  authoritative sources and we need to go with something firmer 
(as we in the  power biz say); second, the examples given both late in the 
statement and near  the end of the brief have been reworked by me in light of 
some very helpful  conversations yesterday, but I may not have gotten them 
right, or put them as  well as I could have; these also need citations if 
possible.
?
I will be out of  play until late morning Monday (going to Charlottesville 
for a speech by my  spouse).? Comments should be routed to others on the WCP 
team as well  as?me.? We hope to have all significant comments by the end of 
next  week (earlier?where possible of course), so that we can put the brief 
in  final shape over the weekend.
?
Thanks to  all.

A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based 
on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP 
customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, 
TDUs and utilities joined in on this.:

Dynegy Power Marketing
Aquila Energy Marketing
Peco Energy Co. 
Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the 
Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal 
could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had 
left SPP)
Coral Power, ELCON and Enron
VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy 
and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with   
a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 
effective date.)
Louisiana Energy Users Group
Tenaska Power Services
El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as 
"hubs" in order to move more toward the gas model)

Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC 
should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on 
whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC 
to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for 
hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

Let me know if you would like a copy of any of these.

----- HIGHLIGHTS---------------------------------------------------------
1)   On October 26, FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on "Competition &
America's Energy Policy" to group of Houston industry executives, addressing 
the
merits and problems with electricity deregulation.
2)   Commissioner Hebert, the sole Republican, supports a comprehensive energy
policy, renewable fuel use, improved pipeline certification, and flexibility,
but opposes price controls and free market intervention.
3)   Last week, the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a "market
stabilization plan" that would affectively cap the price electricity at 
$100/mWh
unless 70% of the power generated is sold forward within the state.
4)   FERC is expected to address this issue on 11/1, but we do not expect much
involvement until after the presidential elections, particularly given that 
the
FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees.
5)   While we believe FERC's role in the electricity market problems in
California will be limited, any action taken is likely to be "bold, ambitious
and strict", requiring results, but likely would not affect 2001.

----- DISCUSSION---------------------------------------------------------
Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and
congressional races, and spiking energy prices have been an area of 
contention.
Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity, and
this past summer, hot weather in the western U.S. sent electricity prices
soaring.  In California, where the rate payers served by PG&E and Edison
International are protected under a rate freeze, the higher power costs cannot
be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer.  In southern 
California,
the situation is just the opposite.  Having recovered its stranded investment
costs from its ratepayers, Semipro Energy is charging market rates to 
consumers
which are complaining of higher electric bills.  While the government has
intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state
and has capped the electric bills of low-income consumers in San Diego, the
state regulators are calling for more government involvement.

In California several proposals are on the table:
1)   A consumer group has called for the "excessive" profits earned by
generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to
ratepayers.  .
2)   U.S. Rep. Bob Finer, D-California, introduced a bill to the House that
would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits, imposing a
windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western U.S.
3)   As recently as last night, October 26, the California Independent System
Operator (ISO) implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps 
on
generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between
negative $100/MWh and positive $250/MWh.  Effective on 11/3, the proposal
essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able 
to
economically produce power within the state.
4)   California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a "bid" cap on 
electricity
of $100/mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply
with the requirement of selling 70% of their load under forward contracts 
within
the state of California.  Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means
that spot power will be sold under the existing $250/mWh price cap but 
violators
would be subjected to the $100 bid cap.
5)   California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their
contracts, preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts, thus
ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power
shortage.

While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current 
form,
the government is likely to be involved.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy
markets, and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to
competition thus far except for in the Midwest.  As a reminder, the FERC is 
made
up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President, and 
currently
the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican (the other 
Republican
commissioner resigned earlier this year).

On Thursday, October 26, 2000, the sole Republican, Commissioner Curt Hebert,
Jr., gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the
subject of "Competition and America's Energy Policy".  While his opinions are
not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole, Hebert clearly supports
regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental
issues.  He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity
price caps in New England, New York and California.  Hebert believes that the
recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market
indicators that electric generation is in short supply, particularly during
periods of hot weather.  In the summer of 1999, the Midwest experienced 
similar
price spikes also related to summer heat.  The difference between the two
situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide, which responded
with new generation projects, but California imposed price controls on
electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation.  Thus, 
the
short supply situation in California may just get worse.

The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes
in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general 
public.
  While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation
in that state, any actions would not likely take affect until 2002.  In the
interim, the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of
uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to
provide emergency financial relief.  Proposals include a refundable rate
surplus, removal of frozen rates, and/or the deferral of stranded cost 
recovery.
  We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections
because political considerations may influence their decisions.

Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to 
send
to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work, and
believe that any plan should be "bold, ambitious and strict" in requiring
results.  Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged, although this is 
not
necessarily good news for the natural gas industry, and old issues like the
Fuel Use Act and the "Btu" tax may resurface.  Ideally, the FERC would endorse
market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and
transmission infrastructure.  However, by doing so, the FERC may be perceived 
as
the "bad guy", which may not be ideal image in an election year.  However,
Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right
regulatory decision for the long term.  The benefits of price controls are 
short
term, and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of
the U.S. opens to electric competition.

		 Subject: EOL Regulation - CFTC or FERC?

As you are all probably aware, FERC staff will be conducting a visit to Enron 
next Monday to discuss EOL and electronic trading's role in the energy 
markets.   Dave Forester, Kevin Presto, and Phillip Allen will be giving 
presentations about the EOL platform, power trading, and gas trading, 
respectively.

In preparing for the meetings, the issue of which agency, CFTC or FERC, 
regulates the EOL platform and any energy related financial products sold by 
Enron (everyone agreed that physical deals through EOL were FERC 
jurisdictional) came up.

It is unclear about Enron's current position.  While there is a strong case 
that both the EOL platform and any energy related financial products are 
regulated by the CFTC, some people believed that Enron had previously 
informed FERC that they were the "appropriate" agency for the energy related 
financial products.

We do not intend to make an issue of this topic with the FERC staff on 
Monday, but rather wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page 
going forward.

Please let me know if we need to have a meeting to bring this to closure.

Rick, Linda and I met with Dan Larcamp (Director of FERC's Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates) yesterday.  He made several comments of interest:

Enron's Position on Market Structure

Dan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like "PJM."  Dan would like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:  

	-	what brings liquidity
	-	what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end use customers -- how does 			liquidity benefit consumers?
	-	why do we support PJM over New York and New England
	-	what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right signals to generators of where to site 


Gas Pipeline Issues

Dan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  

Regulatory Gap

Dan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.

He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat defensive in response to those comparisons.

Open Access

Dan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.

EPSA 

Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result (lower prices).

Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like to visit with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the foregoing.

Further info on the MISO case:

Discussion on the MISO administrative cost adder indicated that the Commission will require that it be charged also to the native load.  This is because all load must be under the RTO tariff.  I spoke with staff after the meeting and was told that this was a minimum RTO requirement and had been stated in the original Southern RTO order.  MISO had not included native load under the RTO tariff, as recently as the latest filings made August 31.  This is a real backdoor way of requiring MISO to put all load under the RTO tariff and was apparently done on the Commission's own initiative.

Midwest utilities had argued that they could not recover the administrative cost adder because they had capped retail rates.  Chairman Wood told them that they could recover the adder because they should be reducing their retail rates because they would not have to provide the same services that the RTO would now provide.  

We will have more details when we read the order, but this is another example of this Commission taking bold action on RTOs.

Subject:	FERC Meeting Update

FERC Meeting Update (Ray and Donna are at the meeting and may have additional comments when they return):

Interconnection:

It appears that FERC will issue an Advanced NOPR on interconnection procedures (not cost issues) which will basically be a strawman proposal encompassing the ERCOT interconnection procedures.  These procedures will be used as a strawman proposal for standardized interconnection procedures throughout the country.  FERC is going to hold an informal conference in Washington the week after RTO Week (i.e. the week of Oct. 22) to hammer out these issues.  The hope is that consensus will be reached.  Once the procedures are resolved, FERC will then address costs.  Wood wanted to address both issues at the same time since they are so closely related, but Brownell and Breathitt both thought it was better to separate the issues since cost issues are expected to be more contentious and they did not want to slow down getting standardized procedures in place.

Market Based Rates:

This issue was stricken from the agenda.  Wood said they need more time to study the issue.  Breathitt stated some concern that they are going to use the SMA screen (discussed last meeting) because it is still somewhat undefined.  After discussion, however, all the commissioners agreed that they are not voting on anything, and they will decide whether use of the new screen makes sense when they see a draft order applying the new screen to either a triennial review or a new application for market based rates.  Due to RTO Week, Staff does not expect to get an order out using the new screen until November.  

MidWest ISO:

Donna will provide a more complete account of the order, but there were a couple of interesting statements.  This case is primarily about rate issues raised by the MidWest ISO filing.  From the discussion, it sounds like the commission is going to provide some RTO guidance to Midwest, even though the order does not address the scope issue, but it appears that the commissione is still looking at an implementation date of December 15, 2001 for MISO.  We will have to see the order to better understand what this means.

Wood had some interesting questions about costs.  Apparently, MISO proposes to assess a 15 cent administrative fee for its services.  Wood asked why the corresponding savings are not being reflected in the individual utilities' rates.  Because the RTO is now going to provide many of the services the utilities were previously providing, Wood said he would expect the utilities rates to go down, by more than 15 cents collectively, and he wonders where those savings are going to be reflected.  This is good -- Wood is going after the utilities and not allowing them to play these types of games they have played for years now.

Carolina Power and Light and Florida Power Corp.

This is an order on rehearing.  FERC grants rehearing of a prior order regarding imbalance penalties.  Some intervenors argued that the penalties should be credited back to customers.  The prior FERC denied this request and allowed the utility to retain the penalties, but the new FERC has granted rehearing.  Wood said this is consistent with gas and he think basic customer issues should be treated similarly on the gas and electric side.  This too is a good sign that Wood "gets it" and sees no reason why the electric industry should not be treated the same as gas.  We have been arguing for this for years.  This is hopefully a sign of more good things to come.

Call us if you have any questions.

I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion.  While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment.

In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO.  PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA.  FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable.

While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that.  We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO.  It does not provide for exceptions.  

A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug.  First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE.  Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement.  

Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment.  It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA.  Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment - perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly, although this looks a little transparent.  The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO.

Also, Paul and I discussed the "One Western RTO" issue and how Enron responds to that.  We talked about three possibilities: 1) try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue -- push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the one-versus-two-versus-three RTOs in the West; 2) take a position saying that the west is different, the California mess continues, people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west, so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC; 3) support FERC's statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this (although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development); or 4)  focus on the east and forget about the west.

The second option causes me concern because I think that, if we take this position in the West, even though the West is different, our position will be used against us in the East.  For example, some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York (a disfunctional market) will contaminate PJM (a working market).  It's a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east.  If we make contrary arguments in the west, they will be used against us in the east.

Your thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks

Sarah

On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim 
Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer 
(attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings 
for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased 
approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, 
more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's 
proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented:
Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation
Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, 
require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff 
Specific suggested fixes for this summer:
 (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post 
within 24 hours of using CBM the specific details of the "emergency"
 (2) Require random FERC OASIS audits of TLRs and ATC 
 (3) Require retention of data confirming system conditions existing at the 
time of a TLR  

FERC has not acted on these comments yet.

If you read Ray Alvarez's summary from yesterday evening, open the attached=
=20
Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since=
=20
receiving the final order, which was issued this afternoon.  Alan Comnes



The full order is available at: http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.h=
tm

SUMMARY OF FERC=01,S
ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE=20
CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF=
=20
PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS
(Issued April 26, 2001)

Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs t=
o=20
have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will=20
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time =
to=20
the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, ev=
en=20
those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into t=
he=20
ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate=
=20
transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This=20
requirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price=
=20
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in t=
he=20
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a=20
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power=
=20
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission=20
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost wil=
l=20
be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California;=20
emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage=20
Services.  The ISO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to=
=20
be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These=
=20
figures (for the next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and=
=20
Cantor Fitzgerald data. A single market clearing price is determined in rea=
l=20
time for all generators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each=20
gas-fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a=20
confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit.  The=
=20
ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator,=
=20
including maintenance and operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at =
or=20
below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability. =
=20
(Although the following qualification is made: =01&However, all public util=
ity=20
rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on=
=20
market-based rates, discussed infra.=018  Presumably this has to do with=20
anomalous bidding behavior.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher=
=20
than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each=
=20
month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC=20
explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the=
=20
=01&all delivery point=018 index it has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review=
/act. =20
No opportunity costs in real time.  Marketers are not held to any generator=
=20
cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o=
n=20
specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost. =20

Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending=
=20
request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it=
=20
is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy=20
power in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator=
=20
subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC=
=20
order.

New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission=01,s =
price=20
mitigation measures.


Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving=20
entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load=
=20
to be curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand=20
curve more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours=
=20
(24/7)) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
=20
outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the=
=20
order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages,=20
including periodic reports to the Commission.

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1=20
or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consistent=
=20
with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
=20
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are du=
e=20
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te=20
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical withhol=
d=20
of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate=20
bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the=
=20
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit=
=20
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be=
=20
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited=
=20
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other=
=20
prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit much=
=20
higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to=
=20
increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.

West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  =01) Opens a section 206 investigation=
=20
concerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the=
=20
CAISO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price=20
mitigation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in=
=20
real time (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot=20
markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a=20
control area.    FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in=20
California.  Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Althou=
gh=20
it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PN=
W,=20
the FERC sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the=
=20
Order.

NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is=20
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines=
=20
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part=
=20
of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generation=
=20
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.=
 =20

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on (1)=20
whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a=

Steve - So far all that's been posted is the Amaren RTO order.  I've attached it below as a text file.   I'm also overnighting a copy of it to you, along with the charts we discussed.  We'll check for the other orders first thing in the morning and send them to you if they've been posted.

Also, Bob Frank gave me a copy of the Judge's recommendation to send to you, and the text file for that is attached below.

Talk to you later,
Elizabeth

Steve,
	We are still in the final preparations for the hearing tomorrow.
Here is the information that I have available right now about ripple claims.


Order of Magnitude
	Obviously the amount of the net ripple claim is determined by the
reference price that is used.  We have done the calculations for three
different reference prices:  ISO (August 9th), Seattle ("Fair Price") and
Tacoma ("Market Price).  The net ripple claims under these different
reference prices range from $125M (ISO) to $370 (Seattle).  The gross amount
of Enron's ripple claims is from $1.2B to $3.1B.

I have asked for a counterparty breakout of rippleclaim estimates from
Charles River and should have that for you tomorrow.

If you have questions, you can reach me on my cell phone a (415) 279-2770.

Thanks
Gary

Steve - see attached list of ripple claimants - there could be more - I
will try to get a complete list by Tuesday.  Also, Gary Fergus is
compiling a list of entities that sold to Enron and the ripple refund
amounts.  Gary, please send the list to Steve directly - thanks.

Sarah -- These are my notes from the meeting with Dan Larcamp. Please circulate to those you believe are appropriate.  I would prefer a limited distribution.  Hope you have a great week-end.  Later Joe

	Analyst:  Pat does not care about the effect he is having on Wall Street.  Wall Street should make the 	attempt to meet with him, but nothing we can say will likely have an effect.

2.	Building pipelines:  Pat will give pipelines certificates to build, but will be hard-nosed on protecting captive customers/native load from any rate increase (perhaps demanding rate reductions). 

3.	Rates on pipelines:  Section 5 cases are more likely to be started by the Commission in the future (this is one way to ensure periodic rate reviews).

4.	Structured Goals:  We should look to the Texas Web Page for an example of the list of priorities for the coming year, updated by quarter.  This approach will likely be adopted by FERC (and be in place Mid-Fall).  Pat will run FERC like a business.

5.	Degradation of Service:  Two El Paso complaints were filed (filings that aver that El Paso oversold its system).  Pat is very concerned about pipelines overselling firm capacity.

6.	Marketing Affiliates:  It will be a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
	Discounts will be required to be communicated contemporaneously to all shippers.  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking still a work in progress and staff remains divided.  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking may not stay on the agenda this meeting, and, if postponed, it will be worse.

a.	Non-conforming contracts are considered a problem because pipelines can favor their affiliates and FERC cannot monitor them.               
b.	Staff is discussing the Dominion standard (applying standards of conduct to the corporate family) and it is being considered and debated for inclusion in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  

Lastly, We should expect long Commission meetings because Pat and his fellow Commissioners want to debate issues in public.  Please call if you have any questions.  202.466.9150 (w), 703.503.0555 home

Subject: Reg. Information - Interconnecting Generation in the East

This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding 
interconnecting generation plants in the East.  Please forward this to your 
groups.  Thanks.  Christi Nicolay 37007  EB3108h.  I am available for your 
federal/FERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct 
state/regional regulatory people.

When initially deciding where to site a plant, there are several federal 
regulatory issues to consider:  

First, you will need to obtain the utility's interconnection policy and a pro 
forma interconnection agreement from the utility.  For most utilities, you 
will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement.  Some utilities 
have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page.  The OASIS 
sites have areas that do not require a password, but if the information is 
not available in that area, you should contact the power trading desk 
transmission personnel to assist in locating the information.  If a utility 
says it does not have a policy, you can let me know.

The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for 
the utility to study the interconnection (Typically, app. $10,000).  When you 
return the money and the request (which is usually an agreement that must be 
initialled by ENA legal), the project will be placed in the "queue."  The 
queue is usually available on the OASIS.  If the utility does not post the 
queue, let me know.  

Many times the procedures require the project to meet "milestones" in order 
to remain in the queue.  If the milestones look unreasonable, let me know.

FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) recently issued an order 
(Tennessee Power case) in which FERC stated that asking for "interconnection" 
is separate from a request for "transmission" under a utility's Open Access 
Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an 
order dealing with interconnection.  Many utilities will try to charge 
additional "network upgrade" costs, not simply the costs to interconnect.  
This is not allowed under the new FERC rule (Note: PJM and NEPOOL have 
different rules due to their pool structure).  

In addition, in the Tennessee Power case, FERC stated that utilities are 
required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study 
process.  Generally, these timelines are in the attachment below.  Most of 
the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer 
than what FERC is now requiring.  You should probably first call the utility 
to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERC's new 
order.  If that doesn't work, you can call me.

There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures 
at FERC:  PJM, NEPOOL, Ameren, Entergy, ComEd.  Enron is actively protesting 
Entergy's proposed procedures and interconnection agreement (a FERC order is 
expected 4/26/00).  In addition, ComEd's procedures have been protested and a 
FERC order is expected soon.  Other utilities may be filing their procedures 
shortly.  Once you have gotten the procedures and interconnection agreements, 
I am happy to review them.

An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement.  Generally, I 
review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective.  It is 
important to have someone in Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it 
after in-service or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant.  The 
interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions, including 
imbalance provisions, that are typically very one sided toward the utility, 
so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is 
executed.

Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for 
transmission.  You should consult the power trading desk transmission people 
in order to determine whether a request for firm or non-firm transmission 
needs to be made.  The desk can make the request if necessary.  While the 
desk may choose to use daily/hourly non-firm transmission for some of the 
Enron plants, the decision is made on a case-by-case basis.  You do not want 
your plant to be "stranded" without the ability to wheel electricity away 
from the busbar, unless you are building a plant in order to sell power 
directly to the interconnected utility, and even then, you may want to wheel 
power around at times.

If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power 
from the plant, the plant/Enron may have to pay "network upgrades."  You want 
to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm (priority) basis 
if you pay for network upgrades.  Some utilities simply provide "transmission 
credits" when requiring network upgrades.  These are not as valuable to Enron 
because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesn't 
have a "reservation" for the transmission.  The Eastern interconnection is 
prone to curtailments of transmission called "TLRs," especially in the 
summer.  The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission.

In order to sell power to the grid, the plant must apply to FERC for "Exempt 
Wholesale Generator" (EWG) status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer 
license with "Market Based Rates."  These filings make the on-site generator 
a "utility" for FERC purposes and subjects the "power marketer" to periodic 
filings at FERC.  These generally must be filed at least 60 days before the 
plant will start producing any power.  The filings take several weeks to 
prepare.

Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant.  The plant 
may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market.  EPMI has the 
FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and 
NEPOOL, but EPMI cannot, at this time, sell in other areas (absent a FERC 
filing and setting up an OASIS web page).  Be aware that many utilities add 
language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to "take" the 
ancillary services from your plant, without compensation.

If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant on-site, additional 
issues are involved.  You can check on the Enron home page under "Sites", 
"Intranet", "Government Affairs", "State Restructuring Reports" for 
information on the status of retail open access in that state.  If you need 
additional assistance, contact Elizabeth Linnell 33896.  

Generally, the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell 
power to a plant.  In order for an on-site plant to sell power to the grid,  
it must apply to FERC for "Exempt Wholesale Generator" (EWG) status and also 
obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with "Market Based Rates."  These 
filings make the on-site generator a "utility" for FERC purposes and subject 
the "power marketer" to periodic filings at FERC.  Because some industrials 
may not want to be FERC regulated, ENA may be able to use a "Special Purpose 
Vehicle" (SPV) so that ENA may own part of the generator.  There are also 
options to establish a "Qualified Facility" (QF) that sells power to the 
interconnected utility.  The interconnected utility may also have a program 
in which it purchases excess power from the on-site plant.  Please contact 
Bob Frank 33180 for help on possible regulatory structures.

There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line, 
such as a 69kv or 138kv.  Some utilties have filed to put these lines into 
their distribution systems, rather than in the wholesale transmission system, 
which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes.  We have 
not fully examined this type of situation, but can if necessary.

There are other regulatory issues, such as site permitting, political 
assistance, environmental permits, that must also be addressed.  The regional 
regulatory people in Rick Shapiro's government affairs group can assist you.

FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders:

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous 
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) 
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in 
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically 
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of 
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order 
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load 
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a 
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to 
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator 
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all 
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and 
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to 
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may 
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in 
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.  
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.  
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some 
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing 
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides 
that "Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long 
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by 
Transmission Provider up to that point."  FPL's unfiled procedures allow 
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers 
includes similar procedures.  

What are "material changes" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's 
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) 
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the 
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions 
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more 
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) 
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the 
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, 
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can 
result in loss of queue spot.  

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected two key elements of
Southern Company Services, Inc.'s proposed Regional Transmission Organzation 
(RTO)
and encouraged the company to explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO 
for the
Southeast. The Commission did not act on other issues raised by Southern.

Southern's proposal for a for-profit gridco (grid company) that would include 
only
new wholesale transmission services and have the benefits of certain rate 
incentives
going to others rather than the RTO operator are inconsistent with FERC's RTO 
policy,
the Commission said. Under Southern's proposal, existing owners' transmission 
facilities
related to bundled retail service or native load would not be under the 
gridco's control.
As a result, the vast majority of total transmission load would not be under 
the RTO's
tariff, operation or direction.

The RTO rule requires all transmission facilities operate under the transco. 
In
addition, Southern could not plan, design and operate a regional grid in a 
manner that
maximizes efficiency if the transco controlled only a small part of the RTO 
load, the
Commission said in rejecting Southern's proposal.

As an alternative to filing a revised RTO proposal, the Commission asked that
Southern consider joining neighboring utilities in an RTO in the Southeast. 
The
Commission directed Southern to file a report by July 13, 2001, on progress 
in forming a
Southeastern RTO.

ALJ just issued her recommendation.  It's 270 pages long - but she finds the PNW is a competitive market, rates were not unjust and unreasonable, and that no refunds should be ordered.  She finds that spot sales consist of 24x24 and "within a month and balance of the month" transactions.  I'll draft a summary and circulate.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=
=20
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r=20
the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=
=20
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=
e=20
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=
=20
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=
.=20
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=
=20
established during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n=20
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=
=20
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98=20
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it=20
risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=
=20
time the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t=20
out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the=20
out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to=
=20
sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted=20
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=
=20
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to=20
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the=20
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the=
=20
state's electricity since January.
?????At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us=
=20
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not goin=
g=20
to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in=
=20
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,=
=20
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since=
=20
May 31.
?????Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=
er=20
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that=20
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e=20
most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
=20
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is=20
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparentl=
y=20
drove away sellers, Hart said.
?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
=20
the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=
d=20
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=20
backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
=20
Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit =

MEMORANDUM

TO: Interested Clients
FROM: John & Hengerer
RE: Commission Meeting -- July 12, 2000

At today's Commission meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda 
and then discussed the following items.

 ELECTRIC MATTERS

Order Nos. 888 and 889
Chairman Hoecker announced the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision 
affirming the Commission's Order Nos. 888 and 889.  In its decision, the 
Court affirmed the open access principles and stated that public utilities 
must provide access to their transmission lines to purchasers and sellers of 
electricity in the interstate market.  While congratulating the Staff for a 
job well done, Chairman Hoecker also noted that these orders are only a first 
step with the next step being Order No. 2000, which is targeted at making the 
national grid available on fairer terms and more efficient for all 
transmission users.  He also added that functional unbundling has proven to 
be inadequate, and that a voluntary regime for reliability is not compatible 
with a competitive market.  Finally, he addressed the lack of investment in 
transmission and generation  and that he expressed hope that there will be 
federal legislation addressing jurisdictional transmission issues.  
Commissioner Massey noted that the Court affirmed a mandatory open access 
approach, thus translating well for a move to a similar mandatory approach 
for RTO policy.  

Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) Phase II, Docket No. RM00-10
Today, the Commission issued, with Commissioner Hebert concurring, an 
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to begin the development of OASIS, 
Phase II.  By February 15, 2001, interested parties are asked to file 
detailed standards for communication protocols and business practices for 
transmission providers and customers to reserve and schedule transmission.  
The standards are expected to be in operation by December 15, 2001, to 
coincide with the date RTOs are to become operational.  This proceeding is 
considered to be part of a continuing evolution of OASIS in order to account 
for e-commerce and the development of RTOs, while also addressing the need 
for fewer seams among regions, increased communications across regions, and 
an increase in functionality via uniformity.  The Commissioners urged the 
industry to develop an industry consensus in order to allow for an expedited 
implementation process.  

However, in his concurrence, Commissioner Hebert expressed concern that this 
proceeding is unnecessary and/or a distraction to competition and to viable, 
stand-alone transmission entities.  Commissioner Hebert believes that this 
implementation issue already is covered by Order No. 2000's recognition of 
the need for interregion coordination and deeming the RTO as the OASIS 
administrator.  Thus, according to Commissioner Hebert, OASIS Phase II is a A
waste of time@.  He also noted his concern that the tight timetable may 
stifle innovation, while diverting attention away from more important issues 
such as scope and pricing.  
     
 NATURAL GAS MATTERS

Post-Order No. 637 Workshops
The first post-Order No. 637 workshop has been announced for September 19th 
as a technical conference.  The subject matter will include changes in the 
market, rates and service changes needed for a more liquid gas market, the 
role of service standardization, and how the electric generation market can 
be supported.  Details on the conference are to follow shortly.

Independence Pipeline Company, Docket Nos. CP97-315, et al.
As part of the consent agenda, the Commission granted a certificate of 
necessity and convenience to the Independence Pipeline project.

Well Category Determinations, Docket No. RM00-6
In response to a court decision, which called into question tax credits for 
certain wells, the Commission approved a final rule re-instating a process 
for natural gas production well category determinations.  The rule 
establishes certain formations and types of wells that can be classified as 
high cost gas eligible for tax credits under Section 29 of the IRS Code.  The 
rules were established to satisfy the court's ruling that a NGPA section 503 
well determination needed to be performed by FERC for the wells to be 
eligible for the tax credit.  The Commissioners noted that this rulemaking 
provides equity for gas producers who have relied on the tax credit, while 
also fulfilling a Congressional expectation.

Sarah Novosel and I are hearing rumors from the FERC that the two new RTO 
dockets on the agenda for tomorrow may be orders in the Northeast RTOs and 
the Southeast RTOs respectively, requiring single regional RTOs.  The orders 
are still being worked on, but may include technical conferences or 
settlement judge proceedings.

Pat Wood is being credited again with pulling together a majority (including 
Massey who has wanted a more aggressive approach in the RTO process) to get 
these orders on the agenda and hopefully voted out.  We will try to get more 
information and copies of the orders as soon as they are available. 

Donna Fulton and Sarah Novosel

		 Subject: FERC Agenda

FERC has two meetings in July (July 11 and 25) and then is on recess for the 
month of August.  The next FERC meeting after July will not be held until 
September 12.  Consequently, FERC tries to get out as many orders as it can 
in July so the backlog is not as great in September.  

Consistent with that goal, FERC has included a lot of cases on its July 11 
agenda.   While some of these cases may be stricken from the agenda for July 
11(and either deferred to the July 25 meeting or until September), we are 
still expecting a lot of action from FERC in July.  The following cases are 
on FERC's July 11 agenda:

RTO Proceedings

Alliance RTO

SPP and Entergy RTOs

PJM and PJM West RTOs

New York RTO

New England RTO

RTO West

Southern RTO

Two new RTO dockets entitled "Regional Transmission Organizations"

Other Proceedings

Mirant vs. ISO New England (June 20, 2001 complaint by Mirant regarding ISO's 
proposal to revise procedures for mitigation of generators run out of 
economic merit order during transmission constraints).

NYSEG v. NYISO (regarding ISO's hybrid fixed block pricing rule)

NERC (these are old docket numbers that go back to orders issued in 1999 
regarding TLR -- Southern and VEPCO sought rehearing of the TLR procedures in 
June, 1999, arguing that they could result in shedding load.  FERC may be 
responding to those rehearing requests).

HQ v. NYISO (regarding HQ's request for FERC to order ISO to reinstate the 
May 8, 2000 market clearing price)

Maine PUC vs. New England ISO (regarding the PUC's complaint against the NE 
ISO asking FERC to direct the ISO to recalculate the energy clearing price on 
May 8, 2000).

California Proceedings

San Diego Gas & Electric v. Sellers (Docket No. EL00-95-038 -- several 
parties have already sought rehearing of the June 19 order -- this could be a 
non-substantive tolling order (putting on hold these requests for rehearing), 
or it could be something more substantive.

Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in 
the Western United States

Please let me know if you have any questions concerning these proceedings.

Effective February 13, FERC approved the Southern Source and Sink 
restrictions, without comment other than stating that they mirrored Entergy's 
restrictions, approved last year.  Commissioner Massey concurred stating that 
this order is consistent with the Entergy precedent; however, he reiterated 
that this shows a flaw in OATT structure that gives LSEs a competitive 
advantage.  Massey calls on the RTO proposals to remedy this flaw.

Other issues:

Approved Interconnection procedures w/ these changes:  

 -- While interconnection conveys no delivery service (must reserve 
transmission through OASIS), interconnection conveys an ongoing right to 
access the transmission system at the receipt point

 -- Requires Southern to provide credits for upgrades and explain its policy 
(interconnection customers only required to pay for "but for" interconnection 
costs)

 -- Southern will post required generator information on its OASIS and will 
allow customers 15 days to respond to requests for additional information 
without losing the queue position

 -- Cutoff for additional studies is execution of interconnection agreement 
(or date of filing unexecuted agreement)

 -- Identities of generators will not be posted on the queue

Approved creditworthiness procedures with a credit quality of BBB+/Baa1 (LCs, 
guaranty, prepayment also allowed)

Copy of order is attached.

Thought you might want to see how we're pursuing the "transmission equality" 
issue in Maryland.   Rick and Joe were blind copied on the original message.

Hope you're doing well.

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

The Chief Judge, who is hearing the CPUC complaint case against El Paso, asks 
for extension of the procedural schedule due to the complexity of the case.  
He expects the hearing to end on June 8.  He proposes 30 days to file briefs, 
and 15 days for reply briefs, with Initial Decision due 30 days after that, 
or August 24.   Originally, the Commission had ordered that an Initial 
Decision be issued by May 28th, later extended to July 12th.

Also asks for guidance as to whether the Commission intended him "to compile 
a more complete record on [violations of the marketing affiliate rules] and 
make findings as to whether such a violation, if it existed, contributed to 
the alleged exercise of market power by El Paso Natural Gas Company and/or El 
Paso Merchant Energy".  Maybe El Paso is not in the clear on violating the 
marketing affiliate rules after all!!

Attached are EPMI's responses to the FERC investigation of the bulk power 
markets in the East..  The "summprob" docs highlight examples of 
discriminatory practices and other problems with the OATT rules for trading 
and interconnection activities.  FERC staff asked for similar responses from 
10 power marketers and plans to use the information in the aggregate in in 
its report to the Commission, due Nov. 1.

Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval 
on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market 
and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously 
filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a 
grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent 
that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval 
date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with 
the merger, if necessary.

Subject: Re: FERC Presentation  


It is my understanding that Enron Gov't Affaits would like us to use the FERC 
visits to make the case that the wholesale gas markets are very liquid and 
competitive, while wholesale electric markets are not -- largely because the 
FERC has not fully unbundled electric transmission.    FERC should be 
spending 90% of its time fixing fundamental structural rules in the electric 
side and 10% refining rules on the gas side.    That is not to say that there 
aren't important revisions that the FERC should take up on the gas side.  
These fixes, however, can be characterized as refinements, as contrasted with 
the fundamental changes we seek on the electric side.  Moreover, these 
changes may largely be addressed by the recent Order 637.  

With respect to E-commerce, I believe that the Enron message is that the FERC 
should  fix the structural problems and get out of the way - e-commerce will 
come and in most cases is already here.

Dave Forster of EnronOnLine will be making a presentation that focuses on how 
much more liquid gas is than power, as evidenced by tight spreads.  In 
previous presentations to FERC folks, Steve Kean has made the point that 
while the rules are far from perfect on the gas side (i.e. tariffs are still 
not standardized), the market works because FERC got the basic structural 
rules right (i.e. 636 unbundling). 

I think all your areas of improvement are appropriate (of course I don't 
necessarily like them as a pipeliner), but I think they fit the overall Enron 
message if presented as a list of refinements.   I plan to speak to them 
about competitive pressures our pipeline face,  our current web sites, plans 
for Order 637 postings and intraday capacity release.  

Here are my  thoughts on getting your points across within the overall 
theme.  I'm also sending out a separate email outline of the day.

Subject: RE: Dan Larcamp request


Christi, Jim, et al

This last exchange has been very helpful.  The question that we need some
guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with
the results.  There are at least two levels that we could look at
effectively.

 1.  Fairly quickly, a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of
'98 when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest.  It would need to
focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today
(along with the midwest) and also get a glimmer on (rumor picked up here)
the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers.  The conclusion from '98
was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for
both generation additions and for DSM investments (load response).
Presumably this would carry forward to a 2000 study.

 2.  A more careful look at the same areas described above but more
focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers.  WE
covered this only in a cursory fashion in '98.  Here we would need to do two
things.  The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks
understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other
bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions (the lesson of
'98)not all kWh.  This is different from price spikes in the "pool markets"
where they set the price for all kWh.  The second point is to see that there
is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge, i.e. that
you could "look on EOL" and buy forward a 7x24 for the summer, say, and pay
a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by
absorbing it in a 3 month contract. The "price signal for investment"
conclusion would carry forward as above.

What do you think the level of interest / need is and how quickly does he
need some or all of the answers?

This is a good time for TCA to tackle this.  We have (or had) a quiet moment
for both Fagan and Rao who are the two experts on data development and
analysis from published sources.

Christi, let's talk in the morning so I can scope an RCR.

Thank you.

Richard

Thanks, Jim--Dan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems
are
and to educate his staff.  In that regard, we have offered to have some of
his
staff down to use some of Enron's tools.  He was specifically asking for the
data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps.  I didn't get a
feeling
that he would use the data to say that everything is fine.  In fact, we took
him
through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a "seminar" type
activity for some of his senior staffers.  He is in the process of bringing
on
some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues, etc.  He was very
familiar with the other problems on the grid.

He also asked Kevin why Enron doesn't want LMP everywhere because with our
staffing we can run over everyone else.  Kevin told him that then there is
no
market liquidity and we can't trade with ourselves.  As it is now, there are
less than 10 big players due to the transmission risk.  We explained in
detail
what happens in the "Into" Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with
transmission/physical risk.  Kevin said that even the big bank players, like
Morgan Stanley, usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so
they
do not have to take transmission risk.  Dan L., having come from gas,
understood
the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin.  (He sat down in
Kevin's chair and looked at pricing on EOL.)

Overall, it was a very positive meeting.  Kevin was impressed that Dan L.
really
understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something, but needed
help
in educating his people.

Christi, etal --

I don't disagree with this analysis, but the drive for competitive
generation is
not simply related to the short term benefits (one year total energy bill
versus
next year total energy bill).  Competitive generation is also about risk
transfer - regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers,
merchant
generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders.

In addition, I hope that Larcamp won't take our data / analysis and try to
argue
that "everything is fine".  Clearly there are many undone / misdone public
policy problems (e.g., native load exception, hourly transmission, etc.)
left in
the wholesale energy markets.

Subject:  Dan Larcamp request

Richard T. -- Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a
comprehensive,
real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing
how
much on a $kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes
(including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the
remainder of the year.)  He needs this to fight price caps.  How much would
something like that cost (probably using some of the data you gathered last
year.)?  How long would it take to create?  Thanks for your help.

Can you please forward this to Miriam Erickson.  It is a Petition for 
Rulemaking that was filed with FERC 3/98.  Although FERC has not made this 
filing into a rulemaking, FERC did cite many of the examples in App. D in the 
RTO NOPR.  I would point out that Order No. 2000 would still not resolve 
examples like  A.1 unless the "native load exception" is removed and all uses 
of the transmission system are under the same tariff.  I would be happy to 
talk further with Ms. Erickson about this.  Thanks. Christi

Please provide comments on the draft show cause order by COB Monday 9/10.  There may be a revised version out later today with Steve W. and some other comments incorporated after yesterday's phone call.  Final draft should be ready Tues. or Wed. and we will have a conference call late Wed afternoon to finalize.  It can then be shopped at FERC (Linda/Sarah -- can you gather a list of who to contact at FERC?)  Also, Steve and Rick will take it to the Commissioner meetings on 9/17.  

We want to have some press coverage when we file (Janel to handle?)
Paul is going to clear this with PGE deal folks
Paul needs to give a heads up to Western govs when we file
We can provide it the day before or day of filing to some groups:  Ideas
-EPSA
-ELCON, Steel group, etal. (filed this week to support FERC mandating a single Midwest RTO)
-Nat'l Rural Elec. Coop (Glenn English recently gave a speech requesting a fully integrated grid)
-These groups filed to make Alliance get an independent board (Janine-would they be helpful?):  Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers, Industrial Energy Users-Ohio; WVa Energy Users Group; Assoc. of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity; Citizens Action Coalition of Ind; Izaak Walton League of North America; Environmental Law and Policy Center
-Some coops and munis represented by Speigal and McDiarmid in DC and Miller Balis & ONeill in DC (EPMI signed on to their filing against the NC PUC's request for stay of the SE RTO mediation)

Contains Steve's comments                                 plus, we are changing the MBRs test to state that OATT is not enough to mitigate transmission market power -- need to agree to join RTO as finally ordered per 7/12 orders.  Thanks

Cynthia -- Attached is a memo (no names basis) with examples of problems EPMI 
encountered last summer.  You should probably ask Joe to make sure that it is 
OK to reference things that FERC enforcement said to me.  If not, I'll take 
that out of the memo.  This list is based on the list that Steve and Rick 
handed out to FERC?/or Congress? last summer in Washington.  

Joe--Would this be helpful to provide to Kevin Madden?

The Commission discussed its market based rate policy at today's meeting.  They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:

For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the "Supply Margin Assessment" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  

Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  

Since the interim measure is only a "snapshot" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.

Below are summaries of the major cases discussed at today's FERC Open Sunshine Meeting.  More detailed summaries and analysis of the attendant orders will be included in the Weekly Report next week, or may be sent out as supplemental reports as the orders are issued.


OFO Presentation and Discussion, GX01-1 [Item G-1]

In a Power Point presentation Staff discussed OFOs, citing past customer concerns that gave rise to Order 637 revisions, and recommending further remedies in the form of monitoring mechanisms (see bullets from presentation below).  

The crux of the discussion among the three Commissioners (Commissioner Massey was absent due to illness) is that FERC will monitor pipeline OFO habits proactively to look for patterns of abuse on particular systems. Such a pattern could the need for additional facilities to alleviate constraint points.

Commissioner Breathitt agreed to the approach outlined, but indicated that it would be prudent to allow Order 637 revisions time to work. She noted that the issue is and has been pipeline specific, not industry-wide.  Commissioner Brownell also clarified that, though the monitoring mechanism (through EBB postings and reports to Commission) is new, the Commission has not seen a recent pattern of abuse - the mechanism is designed to anticipate future problems.
 
Presentation bullets:

Commission's Goals

Ensure reliable service;
Minimize OFOs, maximize market forces and customer flexibility;
Give shippers information needed;
Monitor OFO abuse to identify system constrain points.

Initiatives to Achieve Goals

Order 637 to enhance market design rules;
Market monitoring;
Necessary infrastructure additions.

OFO Definition

Issued by pipelines to maintain service reliability;
Can be system-wide or limited to specific pipeline segments;
Typically restricts use for receipt/delivery points;
Requires shippers to stay in balance at tightened tolerance levels.

OFO Addressed in Order 637

Too ill defined; too large in scope;
Remains in effect too long;
Market affiliates unduly benefit;
Shippers not informed on timely manner;
Level of OFO penalties excessive.

Order 637 Remedies

Better define OFO;
Develop a continuum of emergency measures;
Timely inform shippers of OFO;
Set proper OFO penalty level and credit revenues to shippers;
Require OFO activity report.

Market Monitoring

Staff will oversee OFO activity;
Oversight will rely on EBB postings; pipeline reports, and other sources.


Efficient and Effective Collection of Data,GX01-2  [Item G-22]

Chairman Wood called this item for discussion in response to queries from the American Public Gas Association (APGA) about what actual market data is generally available for the natural gas industry.  This issue came out in part due to the AGA storage data error that occurred a month or so ago.  APGA suggests the following information be available:
1.	Production
2.	Production capability (and resulting utilization rate based on #1 and #2)
3.	Pipeline capacity
4.	Operational capacity (and resulting utilization rate based on #3 and #4)
5.	End-use by customer class

Because of the AGA "hiccup" on its data storage numbers, Chairman Wood would like to see more than one data source for important market information (though it may not be FERC's job to collect such data). Commissioner Brownell suggested the establishment of a stakeholder group to determine what kind of information is needed, if any information is collected and not used, and how collected information will serve the market.  Staff noted that several information collection items are being developed for the 2002 FERC Business Plan, and the APGA list may be incorporated into that effort. 

East Tennessee Expansion for new generation, CP01-80  [Item C-1]

This case, in which an East Tennessee expansion to serve a new generation load is approved, was called by Chairman Wood in response to a specific issue raised by APGA.  APGA is concerned that the "proliferation of pipeline projects" to serve generation are being approved without consideration of the resultant impact on the nation's gas customers - that impact being the exacerbation of natural gas prices across the board.  Chairman Wood said he wanted to clarify publicly that, as stated in the order, it is not FERC's job to decide "why any person needs gas?.the public is best served when the market dictates" price and supply.  He pointed out that the Commission's certificate policy is very direct and clear on risk, and he is comfortable with that state of affairs.

Generation Interconnection, EX01-5  [Item E-1]

The Commission agreed to establish a Straw Man model (probably using the ERCOT model) to modify generation interconnection procedures, service agreements and rights. This process will precede a NOPR that will establish interconnection standards to alleviate complaints, constrictions and delays in processes. Once the Straw Man method is finalized, the NOPR will have an accelerated process in which to comment, reply and implement in a final rule.  This is "Step One" of the process, with "Step Two" to be a subsequent and separate NOPR to examine and resolve the cost responsibility issues related to interconnection standards.  The Commissioners agreed that splitting the financial aspect out into a separate proceeding will allow for an "easy win" on the establishment of standards.  Cost issues include a) allocation between generators and providers and b) common costs recoverable across all users. 

Carolina Power & Light, ER01-1807  [Item E-15]

Chairman Wood called this case for discussion to highlight a change in Commission policy.  In this case, FERC is imposing the gas model for penalty revenue crediting to electric transmission providers.  Described as a "market based imbalance solution," the prospective change requires that revenues from imbalance penalties should be credited back to non-offending customers.  The exact mechanism for such crediting has not been outlined in the Carolina order.  Commissioner Brownell reiterated that this approach "sends the right economic signals" to transmission customers to stay in balance.

RE:=09=09Commission Meeting -- October 24, 2001

At today's lengthy Commission meeting, the Commissioners approved the conse=
nt agenda and then discussed the items detailed below.=20

ELECTRIC MATTERS

State Participation in RTO Development Process
In light of comments voiced during last week's RTO workshops, Commissioner =
Brownell
suggested that avenues for participation by the State Commissions in the RT=
O development process need to be explored.  She suggested that one option m=
ight be to establish regional panels made up of state commission representa=
tives.  Commissioner Brownell further suggested that state commissions, per=
haps through such regional panels, could explore issues related to RTO set-=
up, adequacy of revenue requirements, demand-side management programs, mark=
et monitoring and mitigation, and distributed generation.

The other Commissioners generally echoed Commissioner Brownell's sentiment,=
 although Commissioner Massey cautioned that the pace of RTO development sh=
ould not be slowed by excessive or redundant administrative procedures and =
costs.  The Commissioners unanimously voted to instruct Staff to develop pr=
oposals for greater state commission involvement, and to present their prop=
osals to the Commissioners at an upcoming agenda meeting.  At this point, t=
he initiative appears to be designed to explore alternatives.  More concret=
e proposals, however, could be included in the broader RTO strategy the Com=
mission is expected to announce in the near future.

Discussion of RTO Development Process in Southeast, Docket No. EX02-1
Staff began the discussion with a power point presentation on the Southeast=
 RTO mediation process, noting that participants had reached a consensus on=
 most issues, including market monitoring, operational authority, short-ter=
m reliability, and planning.  Staff explained that consensus could not be r=
eached on issues of governance and independence and provided an overview of=
 the two competing RTO Models outlined in the Judge McCartney=3Ds mediation=
 report.  After briefly describing the Collaborative Governance (CG) model =
and Independent System Administrator (ISA) model, Staff identified positive=
s and negatives for both.  Staff did not take a position on which model sho=
uld be approved by FERC; rather, it concluded that either model satisfies t=
he requirements of Order No. 2000.  Staff also noted that in the Southeast,=
 participation by public power is essential to the formation of a functioni=
ng RTO in the region.

After Staff=3Ds presentation, Judge McCartney and Herbert Tate (former New =
Jersey Chairman) discussed the proceeding with the Commissioners.  Specific=
 issues discussed included: public power participation, concern over indepe=
ndence in the ISA model, whether the ISA was analogous to current ISOs, and=
 the allocation of functions in the CG model.  Overall, Judge McCartney exp=
ressed support for CG model, citing concerns over independence in the ISA m=
odel as well as, what she viewed as, the experimental nature of the ISA pro=
posal.  As a former state commissioner, Mr. Tate outlined the concerns expr=
essed by the state commissions during the mediation period.  In their final=
 recommendations, both Judge McCartney and Mr. Tate encouraged the Commissi=
on to provide additional guidance as to the essential elements or principle=
s to structure RTOs.

Discussion of RTO Developments in the Northeast, Docket No. EX02-2
Staff began this discussion item with a presentation on the Northeast RTO m=
ediation process.  Staff explained that a Business Plan was issued to imple=
ment the Northeast RTO.  The Business Plan consists of eight sections: post=
-mediation process, governance, market design, operations, technology asses=
sment, transmission tariff-related issues, regional transmission planning, =
and interregional coordination.  Staff did not detail the content of the Bu=
siness Plan, but noted that in the two areas where there was disagreement B=
 governance and market design options B the plan included three alternative=
s for each.

Staff=3Ds presentation was followed by a discussion with Judge Young and Jo=
e Garcia (former Florida Commissioner).  Judge Young explained that the Bus=
iness Plan provides a viable blueprint for the formation of the Northeast R=
TO.  He noted that several issues must still be resolved, including: govern=
ance, market design, and shareholder process.  Judge Young reiterated his r=
ecommendation that a independent, non-vendor expert should analyze the tech=
nology of the three ISOs to assess whether entirely new software will be ne=
cessary to implement the Northeast RTO.  In response to Commissioner Breath=
itt, Staff explained that software is one of the biggest hurdles in the Nor=
theast RTO.  Mr. Garcia expressed some concern that the ALJ and participant=
s could waste too must time attempting to achieve the perfect RTO.

Chairman Wood noted that the Commission=3Ds intention is to leave the regio=
n better, not worse off, than pre-RTO.  He also explained that the Northeas=
t is in a better position to form a viable RTO than the other regions becau=
se of the maturity of its markets.  Commissioner Brownell noted that incons=
istencies between the existing ISOs are working against retail competition =
programs in the Northeast region.  She cautioned against proceeding too slo=
wly with regard to RTO formation.  Commissioner Wood noted that there are s=
ome issues that can be resolved relatively quickly, for example, regional t=
ransmission planning, real-time imbalance market software.

In response to Chairman Wood, the Judge Young and Mr. Garcia provided recom=
mendations.  Mr. Garcia explained that the Business Plan provided participa=
nts with a basic plan and asked the Commission to provide guidance in the a=
reas were there was divergence.  He also encouraged the Commission to issue=
 a decision in the near future, noting that the Commission should let parti=
es litigate jurisdictional issues so that RTO issues could be resolved soon=
er rather than later.  Judge Young encouraged the Commission to take the ti=
me to assess market design in order to prevent a further waste of time and =
money in the likelihood that the chosen market design proves unworkable.  J=
udge Young also requested that the Commission provide additional guidance o=
n the parameters of Abest practices,@ governance structure, market design, =
and stakeholder process.
Discussion of RTO Developments in the Midwest, Docket No. EX02-3
Staff provided an update of recent developments in the Midwest.  A settleme=
nt agreement between Alliance and MISO, approved by the Commission earlier =
this year, provides the basis for developing a seamless market in the regio=
n that will be served by the two groups.  Under the terms of the Illinois p=
ower settlement, the financial viability of MISO is guaranteed, the Allianc=
e business model is preserved, and seams issues between MISO and Alliance a=
re addressed.   Staff explained that the seams agreement provides for one-s=
top shopping, congestion information on a joint bulletin board, an imbalanc=
e market, transmission planning, and market monitoring.   =20

Staff explained that both MISO and Alliance recently filed status reports w=
ith the Commission addressing their ability to be functional and the seams =
agreement included in the settlement previously approved by the Commission.=
  Alliance noted that a proposal by National Grid USA (EL01-80-01) to manag=
e the Alliance RTO, along with Alliance's's proposed Business Plan, are cri=
tical to the RTO's start-up.  Alliance reports that it would take up to 120=
 days to initiate operations once it has received final Commission approval=
. =20

In response to Commissioner Brownell, Staff maintained that both MISO and A=
lliance have made progress in addressing seams issues.  Staff expressed sat=
isfaction with both the substance and timing of the entities filings.

There was some discussion over the division of functions between MISO and A=
lliance.  Chairman Wood noted that, if there is going to be one regional en=
tity with not for-profit and for-profit entities, the Commission will have =
to address how the functions should be split.  Chairman Wood also expressed=
 concern that a viable wholesale market may not result if all the functions=
 were delegated to the for-profit entity.

Discussion of Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference, Docket No. AD01-2
First in a series of regional meetings on infrastructure, the Western Infra=
structure Adequacy Conference will be held in Seattle on November 2, 2001. =
 Staff identified three main questions to be addressed at the meeting:  (i)=
 whether the current infrastructure is adequate; (ii) the infrastructure ne=
eds of the region, and (iii) the factors that are inhibiting adequate inves=
tment in infrastructure.  Such questions will be addressed within the conte=
xt of the outlook for growth and population increases in the region as well=
 as the outlook for future energy needs.  The Commission hopes to determine=
 what the states and the federal government can do to encourage infrastruct=
ure investment. =20

Next, Staff gave a power point presentation on the infrastructure throughou=
t the United States.  This presentation, which breaks down energy infrastru=
cture by fuel use and price-responsive demand, can be accessed by the publi=
c on the Commission=3Ds website under AFERC Discussion Papers.@  Staff note=
d that gas is the primary fuel in West and that use of gas continues to ris=
e within the region.  In a separate presentation, Staff then presented its =
findings on its western infrastructure assessment which began in August.  S=
taff has collected data and analyzed information on Western infrastructure,=
 with a final assessment available Friday, October 26, 2001. =20

The western infrastructure assessment was broken into three sections: deman=
d, supply, markets, and transmission.  With regard to demand, Staff traced =
the population and consumption differences over past few years in the West.=
  Staff noted that the Southwest started to consume larger amounts of gas a=
nd electricity because of population and economic growth.  Staff traced gas=
 uses, growth, total capacity, and peak loads within Western region, as wel=
l as projections for demand, capacity, use, and infrastructure.  Next, Staf=
f provided an overview of the supply of electricity, hydropower and gas in =
the United States.  Staff asserted that proven and potential gas reverses i=
n United States could provide supply for next 50 years.  In the portion of =
the presentation on markets, Staff identified the primary trading hubs in t=
he West and the average monthly spot market prices and monthly trading volu=
mes in the region. Staff also noted that recently, there has been a downwar=
d shift in the gas futures market for the West which it attributed to lower=
 temperatures, more capacity, lower gas prices and the Commission=3Ds price=
 mitigation plan.  Finally, Staff provided an overview of transmission proj=
ects in the Western region.

New York Independent System Operator, Inc., Docket No. ER01-2967
Cinergy Services, Inc., Docket Nos. ER01-2984 and ER01-3022
Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket ER01-2985
American Electric Power Service Corp., ER01-2163
In a July 2001 order in Docket No. ER01-2163, the Commission denied a trans=
mission provider=3Ds request to receive interest on system upgrade payments=
.  In this draft order, the Commission issued an interim order which granti=
ng rehearing on this issue. =20

The Commission will address the issue of interest on system upgrade payment=
s in the generic proceeding addressing transmission interconnection.  Commi=
ssioner Breathitt dissented in part, maintaining that the Commission should=
 not issue an interim order, but, instead should address the issue in the t=
ransmission interconnection proceeding where the ramifications can be more =
fully explored.  Commissioner Massey and Wood voiced their support for the =
order, noting that if generators are treated as banks, they should receive =
interest.  However, Commission Massey explained that as a long-term issue, =
he has an open mind as to how the generation costs should be allocated.=20

Kern River Gas Transmission Company, Docket Nos. CP01-70 and CP01-31 =20
There was no Staff presentation on these two items which were placed on the=
 discussion agenda by Commissioner Breathitt.  Although she concurred with =
the decision, Commissioner Breathitt expressed concern over intervenors all=
egations that the pipeline expansion would negatively impact the availabili=
ty of take-away capacity on the Kern River system.  Commissioner Breathitt =
noted that in determining whether pipeline expansions are in the public con=
venience and necessity, the Commission must address concerns that there wil=
l be a degradation of existing shippers firm rights. =20

1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
"off the shelf" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

Please let me know what everyone thinks.

Jim

Subject: Shareholder Meeting

In light of the shareholder proposal from Friends of the Earth Action, we had 
a third-party consultant gather public record background information on the 
group.  

Friends of the Earth Action is a registered Texas corporation, and acts as 
the political arm of Friends of the Earth, Inc., one of the largest organized 
ecological protection groups with its headquarters in Washington DC.  They 
use a systematic political approach to reach their goals, and when that is 
unsuccessful, they have been known to be disruptive.  Friends of Earth Action 
has taken credit for participation, and even claimed an organizational role, 
in the recent demonstrations in Seattle and Washington DC.  

Their literature describes their immediate goals as targeting six politicians 
and six major corporations for shareholder actions and special publicity.  
Brent Blackwell is described as a 'remarkably effective environmental 
activist' who, over 30 years, has led shareholder actions against Exxon and 
DuPont.  Their literature also portends a link to Cuban successes in 
environmental reform.

Our consultant feels this is a powerful group that should not be taken 
lightly, and that future dealings with this group may be less political and 
more demonstrative in nature.

While we don't expect demonstrations at our shareholders meeting, we have 
augmented our security with additional police and security officers.  
Security presence, while elevated, will be low-key and not any more visible 
to shareholders than normal security.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

Subject: RM01-9 Order Proposing Reporting Requirement on Natural Gas Sales To 
California Market and Requesting Comments
Importance: High


I have just received an order proposing new reporting requirements on natural 
gas sales to California markets. Issued today, FERC is proposing a collection 
of information (Appendix consisting of a series of questions to be answered 
by sellers to the California markets, interstate pipelines and LDCs) that 
will assist in understand the disparity that has occurred and continues to 
exist.The information to be reported would include data relating to the 
volumes and prices of sales to California including transporation rates, 
daily operational capacity of pipelines to and in the California markets, and 
the actual volumes flowing to and in California and gas sales and 
trasnportation requirements of LDCs. 

FERC intends to analyze the information and determine what percentage of the 
volumes sold into California is domestically produced gas sold by marketers 
affiliated with pipelnies and LDCs in sales for resales. (These are only 
sales FERC can regulate). This will also give FERC the average gas costs 
being incurred by purchasers moving to California. 

FERC states certain entities, while not regulated by FERC, will need to 
provide the information requested under the authority vested in NGA section 
14 to collect information regardless of whether they are "natural gas 
pipelines."

FERC is proposing that this report be submitted quarterly and submitted 
within thirty days at quarter end. There will be an electronic format 
developed for submission. Responses will be required to be verified under 
oath. Parties may request confidential treatment of their responses. 

This is being requested under emergency processing of the Office of 
Management and Budget auspices. Comments are to be submitted within thirty 
days of this order. 

I will send the order electronically on Monday. It is not on FERC's systems 
yet.

		 Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power 
Systems

Please forward this to Rick's group.  Thanks.

Please note that these FERC staff reports contain some potentially helpful 
information that can be used at the state PUC level, including information on 
the increase in generation in the Midwest that market participants attribute 
to lack of price caps following the summer 1998 price spikes; better 
preparation for summer 2000 through the use of forward contracts and 
transmission problems that may have resulted in keeping cheaper power from 
particular markets.


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Tom and Cynthia--The SE reports includes some dings against TVA.


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Interested Clients

FROM: John & Hengerer

RE: Commission Meeting -- May 17, 2000

At today's meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then 
discussed the following items.  

 ELECTRIC MATTERS
Alliance Companies, et al., Docket Nos. ER99-3144
In December 1999, the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing 
the formation of the Alliance RTO.  At today's meeting, the Commissioners 
denied (by a margin of 3 to 1, Commissioner Hebert dissenting) rehearing of 
the December 1999 order.  The Commissioners also unanimously rejected 
(Commissioner Massey concurring) Alliance's compliance filing.

In its original filing, Alliance proposed allowing each of its 5 active 
owners to retain up to a 5 percent ownership interest in the RTO (up to 25 
percent total ownership by active owners).  The December 1999 order rejected 
this proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No. 
2000, which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of 15 
percent unless special circumstances are shown.  Rejecting requests for 
rehearing, the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active 
member ownership in excess of 15 percent.  Dissenting, Commissioner Hebert 
argued that (i) the 15 percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be 
viewed as creating a binding legal requirement. and (ii) limiting active 
ownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO.


3

The Commissioners also rejected Alliance's compliance filing submitted to 
satisfy the terms of the December 1999 order.  In addition to failing to 
correct the active ownership issue outlined above, the Commissioners faulted 
Alliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues 
associated with the RTO's scope and configuration.  Commissioner Massey 
indicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams@ agreements 
do not negate the need to review the RTO's scope and configuration to ensure 
that it is properly designed and sized. 

Southwest Power Pool, Docket No. EL00-39
The Commissioners unanimously rejected, as failing to meet the requirements 
of Order No. 2000, the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) RTO proposal.  
Commissioner Massey, who moved the item to the discussion agenda, cited the 
following shortcomings in SPP's proposal: (i) operational control of 
transmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO; (ii) the RTO's 
proposed open-access transmission tariff did not comply with Order No. 2000; 
(iii) no real-time balancing market had been proposed; (iv) lingering 
concerns with the RTO's governance structure; and (v) the RTO's proposed 
scope and configuration are inadequate.  Commissioner Massey encouraged the 
SPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO, or consider merging with 
the Midwest ISO. 

Notice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments, 
Docket No. EL00-75
The Commissioners unanimously approved short-term procedures designed to 
address Summer 2000 reliability concerns.  The approved measures provide for 
(i) streamlining FERC procedures to promote on-site, distributed generation, 
(ii) waiving prior-notice requirements for load-reduction agreements, (iii) 
improving demand-side price signals, (iv) requiring more extensive OASIS 
posting of available transmission capacity; and (v) making Commission Staff 
more available to the industry to address reliability concerns.  Comments on 
the proposed short-term measures are due by June 2, 2000.  

Additionally, agreeing that the short-term procedures are very minimal in 
nature, the Commissioners requested comments on long-term reliability 
issues.  Comments are due by June 30, 2000.
Finally, Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate 
concurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to 
reliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating 
artificial price caps and promoting competitive rates.  Commissioner Hebert's 
accusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good 
policy touched off a heated debate, with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC 
successes and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Hebert's 
suggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages. 



 GAS MATTERS
Regulation of Short-Term Natural Gas Transportation Services, Regulation of 
Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Services, Docket Nos. RM98-10, RM98-12
The Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for 
rehearing of Order No. 637.  Finding that Order No. 637 strikes a good 
balance between competing interests, the Commissioners indicated that their 
order would, with several exceptions, uphold the mandates of the order.  The 
Commissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of 
right-of-first-refusal (ROFR) roll-up issues would be denied. Order No. 637 
states that, if a pipeline is fully subscribed, a party wishing to exercise a 
ROFR will be required to match competing bids, even if a competing bid 
exceeds the maximum rate for the capacity.  

Revisions and clarifications of Order No. 637 approved by the Commissioners 
at today's meeting include:
(1) shippers with multi-year contracts at max rates for seasonal service will 
retain their ROFR;
(2) pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of 
each nomination cycle, rather than within one day as directed by Order 637;
(3) short-term capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour 
of the first nomination under the contract, rather than upon the execution of 
the contract as stated in Order No. 637; and
(4) Order No. 637's OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in 
the Commission order.

Although comments at today's meeting were brief, we anticipate a lengthy 
order addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for 
rehearing.

Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order

There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

release plans for tackling electricity costs. Potential solutions include 
price caps, moves to foster competition.
Los Angeles Times, 11/01/00


USA: US FERC probe finds no Calif. market abuse by utilities.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on 
Wednesday said in a report that California utilities were not necessarily to 
blame for last summer's price rises, which led to an unravelling of the 
state's move to deregulate retail power markets. 
A FERC staff investigation, which was to be released in full later on 
Wednesday, found California's market structure and rules "flawed," which 
combined with tight supplies caused the price of electricity to rise to 
record highs in both wholesale and retail markets.
FERC has proposed rule changes to fix the operations of the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO) and Power Exchange (PX). The draft changes 
would eliminate the need for Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and 
Electric and SoCal Edison from having to sell into or buy from the power 
exchange. 
Other highlights from the proposal include establihshing an independent, 
non-stakeholder to oversee the ISO and PX; modifying the auction market; new 
reporting requirements; and accelerating new siting of power generation 
facilities and eliminating some environmental impediments to new plants. 
If approved by the full commission at its Wednesday meeting, the changes 
would become effective in 60 days. California regulators and industry 
officials have until Nov. 22 to comment on FERC's proposed changes.

US FERC To Order Sweeping Changes For Calif Pwr Market

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday proposed sweeping structural changes for California's 
problem-plague power market. 
The commission proposed the changes in response to a staff investigation 
report, unveiled Wednesday, which found no "smoking gun" evidence that power 
sellers in the state had manipulated market prices to financial benefit.
Instead, FERC blamed the state's mandated market structure for the 
electricity supply shortages and spiking wholesale power prices passed on to 
retail customers in San Diego. 
At the same time, utilities elsewhere in the state hemorrhaged hundreds of 
millions of dollars due to a state-mandated rate freeze that required them to 
sell power at below cost.

The fate of California's rocky experiment in electricity deregulation hangs 
in the balance today as federal regulators meet to decide whether to 
intercede in the state's dysfunctional $23-billion energy market or to let 
free-market forces continue to wreak havoc. 
The four-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will release a 
long-awaited staff report analyzing the root causes of California's energy 
crisis and, more important, issue a draft order or action plan on how to 
solve the problems of runaway wholesale electricity costs.
During public hearings in San Diego in September, FERC Chairman James J. 
Hoecker promised that the commission would take action and "do whatever it 
takes" to repair California's electricity market, whose deregulation was set 
in motion by landmark state legislation in September 1996. 
Just what the report and order will say remained a matter of intense 
speculation on the eve of their release. The FERC commissioners could impose 
new price caps or order an overhaul of the California Power Exchange and the 
Independent System Operator, the state agencies that conduct daily auctions 
for electricity. The commissioners may ask the state to undertake new 
initiatives to foster more competition in a retail power market still 
dominated by the three big investor-owned utilities. 
But an indictment of power generation companies--which some in the state 
accuse of "gaming," or manipulating the system to wield unfair "market power" 
and wringing excessive profits from customers--is unlikely, according to 
published reports and state industry principals and government officials. 
The FERC commissioners are said to blame market deficiencies and defects in 
California for a supply-demand imbalance that sent wholesale electricity 
prices skyrocketing in July to an average of 12.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, more 
than triple the July 1999 average of 3.9 cents. A typical residential 
customer of San Diego Gas & Electric, the first state utility to fully 
deregulate, saw his or her bills triple before state legislators stepped in 
to cap retail rates in August. 
Just as worrisome to many observers is that wholesale electricity rates 
remain sky-high today, even after the end of peak summer power demand. 
Wholesale rates in October averaged about 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, double 
the average cost a year ago, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the 
Independent System Operator. 
In any case, billions of dollars of investments as well as the political 
careers of prominent California politicians could be affected by what FERC 
does. U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is coming out from Washington to 
hold a news conference with Gov. Gray Davis in Sacramento this morning to 
announce new, unspecified initiatives to address California's electricity 
problems. 
The Davis administration has gone on record demanding that FERC, which 
oversees the transmission and wholesale selling of electricity around the 
country, to step in and discharge its legal duty to restore "just and fair" 
electricity rates in California. The ballooning of electricity rates in San 
Diego during the summer created a political firestorm that raged unabated 
until the state Legislature imposed its caps. 
Rates paid by retail customers in the Southern California Edison and Pacific 
Gas & Electric coverage areas are frozen as well for the time being. But $5 
billion in "undercollections"--the difference between what the investor-owned 
utilities have paid for wholesale electricity this year and what they can 
charge consumers--looms overhead, worrying Wall Street. 
"I have no idea what the FERC will say," said state Public Utilities 
Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee who says she is as much 
in suspense as anyone. "But we are expecting a substantial order that would 
move the ball forward on repairing the wholesale market in California." 
Consumer advocates and the state's major utilities would like to see FERC 
impose some sort of wholesale price controls--even gut the Power Exchange and 
the Independent System Operator because they are clearly not working as 
intended. 
"We expect some radical surgery," said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra 
Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Some consumer groups would like to see FERC declare the wholesale rates 
collected by generators "unjust and unreasonable," legal code words that 
would open the gates to actions by the PUC or the Legislature to force the 
power companies to disgorge or refund excessive profit. Such an action, which 
would lead to litigation by the power companies, is considered unlikely. 
Business interests, including the power generators that have reaped enormous 
profit from the dysfunctional market, are arguing to let free-market forces 
prevail because restrictive price caps would abort the market's evolution and 
possibly stifle construction of new power plants, which offer the best 
long-term solution to the state's predicament. 
"We expect that the FERC will find that the high prices of this past summer 
are a result of supply-and-demand imbalance and market design defects on the 
retail and wholesale side, but that the market participants have been playing 
within the rules and that there has been no manipulation or gaming," said 
Brent Bailey, general counsel of Duke Energy North America of Houston, a 
major generation player in the California market. 
Duke and others also strenuously oppose a solution proposed by the state's 
municipal utilities, notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power: 
that the industry in essence be re-regulated by imposing a system of 
cost-based rate controls, similar to how electricity rates were set before 
deregulation. 
Such a move would lead to lawsuits filed by Duke and other power merchants 
alleging "confiscatory" actions by the state nullifying the value of hundreds 
of millions of dollars they have invested in California power plants. Bailey 
favors temporary price caps until the market regains its balance, as well as 
new tweaking of the power market to stir up competition. 
Los Angeles DWP General Manager S. David Freeman, who has led calls for 
temporary imposition of cost-based rates, said California's failed 
deregulation experiment raises the possibility that electricity is 
intrinsically an "un-deregulatable" service. 
"Three years ago, I thought it would work. Then we had a train wreck," he 
said. "I'm not committing heresy when I say that I think it may not work out."

Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing 
protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve 
transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving 
constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area 
and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against 
TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve "partial paths", which they 
call "fictional" sinks/sources via elimination of the path.  

Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at 
the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are 
working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them 
too.  

Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders 
greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let 
them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be 
looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities 
now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out 
last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we 
can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them 
to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.

MAIN ATCSC, C&CSC, EC and OC TP and Control Area Contacts:

MAIN is presently struggling with the issues of how to properly represent
both partial path reservations (those submitted without true source and
sink) and schedules which are not physically realizable in its ATC
calculation and posting process in a way which validly represents the
ability of the transmission system to support power transfers and provides
fair and accurate ATC information to all potential users of the
transmission system.

One of our MIC representatives reported that Entergy has filed a tariff
amendment with a proposal to deal with these issues, and you may wish to
examine the proposed business practices to evaluate the amendment's merits
or potential complications.

If so, below please find instructions for your convenience on how to access
the Entergy tariff filing related to providing valid source and sink
information for evaluation of transmission service, reservations and
schedules:

 The information below provides an electronic link to Entergy's March 21,
2000, filing in FERC Docket No. ER00-1933.  Because the filing is a series
of scanned images, I do not know how to electronically transfer a copy of
the actual filing.  However, if you double-click on the http reference
below, your web browser should take you to a page on the FERC web site.
This FERC page should provide a space for you to enter a "document ID."  In
the space provided, please type in the following

document ID:  2040905

Then hit the [enter] key on your keyboard.  This will bring you to another
FERC web page where you can click on "I=25" (on the far right-hand side of
the screen) which will link you to the 25 imaged pages of Entergy's filing.

Please respond to Susan Dudley 
Here's the outline we sent to FERC yesterday.  I had sent the  following e-mail last week to Dan Larcamp and Ellen Schall (OGC) of FERC.
 
  
Dan - I am a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at  George Mason University.  I recently  taught a course to FERC staff on energy derivatives, and based on that and  discussions with others, think you might benefit from a broader course to help  FERC staff and commissioners understand prices and energy markets, particularly  the relationship between cash or spot markets, and financial markets (including  derivatives).  
We at the Mercatus Center are in a unique position to serve  as a resource to the Commission and staff on economic/financial issues.  We are a nonprofit, research, education,  outreach organization, and, as part of our mission are organized to work with  the administration on different regulatory and market issues.  We would offer the course at no  charge.
We have in mind a team of experts in energy markets with  unique experiences and   perspectives.
Prof. Bill Albrecht, of  Iowa State University is a former commissioner at the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission.  He was there  in the aftermath of the Crash of '87, during the Gulf War and other market  crises, and has a valuable understanding of the issues FERC is facing now,  with respect to the influence of trading and derivative markets on energy  prices.
Jerry Ellig, Ph.D., is  a senior research fellow at Mercatus and has done extensive research and  teaching on market infrastructure issues, particularly in energy markets.
Prof. Vernon Smith, who  has recently joined the faculty of GMU and the Mercatus Center, is known as  the father of experimental economics.   You may be familiar with his sophisticated economic "experiments,"  which offer hands on experience with energy markets, including transmission  constraints, etc. and allow participants and researchers to test market  reactions to different rules, events, etc.
I  am a former CFTC economist, and write and teach courses on risk and risk  management in energy markets.   

Professor Albrecht will be in the area on July 25-26.  Two 3-hour sessions on those days  (starting in the afternoon after your Commission meeting on the 25th)  would provide a strong introduction to these issues.  We could then talk about whether future  courses or workshops would be valuable.
I will call you tomorrow to discuss this idea.

FYI-- "E" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder 
Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but 
the FPA has similar penalty provisions for "knowing and willful" violations.  
Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like 
Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to 
the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the 
concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it 
cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about 
it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric 
companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties.

In Staff's report on its investigation of the bulk power markets in the east, 
the Midwest report notes on page 2-15, Additions to Capacity, that new 
generation has been added in the Midwest region, and that some market 
participants believe that developers sited new generation in the Midwest 
because there were no price caps.  

Steve Kean suggested that we refer to this finding in our November 20 
comments on the California order and specifically draw the conclusion that no 
price caps leads to more generation development.

The Midwest report is attached.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Steve/Rick  -- Here is the E-mail from EPSA group preparing training for FERC 
persons that I mentioned during our conference call.  Since FERCers  tell me 
they know Enron's position, and ask what are others' concerns -- this 
approach has proven successful in the past.    I believe this is consistent 
with what we discussed this morning.  The next group meeting is May 1.  
Suggestions are appreciated.  Call if you have questions.  202.466.9150.

AT=20
LUNCH THURS. 12/7.
-
MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a=
=20
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of=20
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss=
ed=20
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller=
=20
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under =
no=20
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically=
=20
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly=
,=20
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the=
=20
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme=
nt=20
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to=
=20
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta=
ff=20
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p=
ro=20
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp=
ly=20
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and=
=20
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import=
s=20
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we=
ll=20
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that=20
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that=
=20
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could=
=20
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi=
cs=20
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with =
a=20
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the=
=20
commodity and services. =20

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such=
,=20
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic=
e=20
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff=
=20
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac=
k=20
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan=
ts=20
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. =
=20

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from=
=20
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. =
=20
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were=
=20
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even=
=20
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment=
,=20
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The=
=20
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are=
=20
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi=
on=20
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to=
=20
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission=
=20
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an=
=20
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I=
n=20
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase=
d=20
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie=
ve=20
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction=
=20
increased in the Midwest. =20

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati=
on=20
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo=
r=20
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a=
nd=20
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,=
=20
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs=
=20
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully=
=20
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers=
e,=20
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th=
at=20
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed=
=20
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching=
=20
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided=
=20
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp=
er=20
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al=
l=20
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and=
=20
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region=
=20
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th=
e=20
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. =
=20
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud=
it=20
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially=
=20
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are=
as=20
of non-compliance. =20

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,=
=20
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo=
w=20
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information=
=20
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under=
=20
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a=20
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption=
=20
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission coul=
d=20
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t=
he=20
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also=
,=20
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits=
=20
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha=
ve=20
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha=
ve=20
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide=
=20
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively"=20
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory=20
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants. =
=20
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,=
=20
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has=
=20
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the=
=20
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs=
=20
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d=
ue=20
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and=20
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development=
=20
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and=
=20
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act=
ed=20
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the=
=20
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th=
is=20
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than=
=20
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased=20
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to=
=20
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S=
E=20
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence=
=20
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes=
=20
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns=
=20
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio=
n=20
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In=
=20
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff=
=20
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. =
=20
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac=
k=20
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied=
=20
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.=
 =20
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati=
on=20
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais=
es=20
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv=
e=20
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d=
o=20
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs=
=20
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  =
In=20
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.=
 =20
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated=
=20
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the=
=20
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i=
e,=20
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio=
n=20
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la=
w=20
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of=
=20
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list=
s=20
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the=
=20
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park=
=20
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential=
.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin=
g=20
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan=
ge=20
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available t=
o=20
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an=
=20
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not=
=20
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC=
=20
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine=20
competition.

NORTHEAST SUMMARY

Attached is a summary of FERC Staff=01,s November 1, 2000 report on its=20
investigation of the Northeast region.  The report is very encouraging=20
because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution=
s=20
that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging=
=20
because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast=

markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked o=
n=20
this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report=20

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Jeff--you did such a good job that I don't have to type much.   I do have a 
few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks.

The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and 
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening 
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.  
Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion. 

He came across as very sincere---indicated that they were working "around the 
clock" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He 
asked for FERC to help get Califonia to "stabilization" and specifically 
asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on 
electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to 
prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California.  

He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments 
to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so 
that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak.  
Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion.

Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that 
market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay 
for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear)

Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his 
comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  "why should Montana 
ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants."

Greetings:

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
"There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments," JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
"more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over 
the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading 
activity averaging 225,000 TJ's per month. NGX is owned 100% by OM

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)
2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)
2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.
     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

As with many, I was unable to leave on vacation this weekend, so I am back. This is an update to the Weekly Report. 
Below are listed two orders that are vitally important:

Extraordinary Expenditures Necessary to Safeguard National Energy Supplies, PL01-6.
On September 14, FERC issued this Statement of Policy indicating that companies may file applications to recover prudently incurred costs associated with security and reliability during this national crisis. The Policy Statement states companies may propose a separate rate recovery mechanism, such as a surcharge, to currently existing rates. 
http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/MISC/PL/PL01-6.000.TXT

Regulations Under OCS Lands Act Governing Movement of Natural Gas and Facilities on OCS, RM99-5-003
Issued September 13, this order clarifies that information contained in OCSLA reports will not be protected from public disclosure if the information is necessary to determine whether OCS gas service providers are operating in accordance with OCSLA. This forces offshore operators to comply with OCSLA reporting standards. FERC feels that absent information such as the identity of offshore service provider, offshore affiliates, rates and conditions of service for each customer, it would not be possible for FERC to gauge whether offshore entities are complying with the mandates of OCSLA. FERC will consider on a case-by-case basis partial public disclosure to be sufficient to satisfy regulations of Order Nos. 639 and 639-A; warning that withholding of information from the public will not be in compliance with regulations. Five days from issuance of this order, FERC will place information contained in OCSLA reports in public files.

EPMI won a moral as well as financial victory today in the continuing MAPP 
refund proceeding.  In response to EPMI's protest of MAPP's refund report, 
FERC issued an order rejecting MAPP's report, finding that MAPP erred in 
failing to make total refunds to EPMI and others.  As you may recall, in 
response to the complaint filed by EPMI in 1997, FERC issued an order in 
April, 1999, finding that MAPP had overcharged EPMI and other transmission 
customers for transmission service.  FERC ordered MAPP to make refunds to 
EPMI and the other transmission customers.  

In order to make refund payments to customers, MAPP sought payment from its 
transmission owning members.  One transmission owning member, Nebraska Public 
Power District (NPPD), refused to pay MAPP, arguing that it is a 
non-jurisidictional entity and should not have to pay FERC-ordered refunds.  
Because NPPD refused to pay MAPP, MAPP refused to refund to transmission 
customers those amounts assessed against NPPD.  When MAPP filed its refund 
report with FERC (as required by FERC in the April order), MAPP stated that 
it was not refunding those amounts owed by NPPD.  EPMI protested MAPP's 
report, arguing that MAPP is responsible for paying the full amount of 
refunds, regardless of its dispute with NPPD.

In its order issued today, FERC rejects MAPP's filing, stating that "[w]e 
agree with Enron."  (This may be the first time FERC has ever uttered that 
phrase.)  FERC states that Enron and the other customers are entitled to the 
full amount of refunds, and MAPP cannot use its dispute with NPPD to escape 
its obligation to pay full refunds.  While FERC does not address the issue of 
whether MAPP is a public utility itself (an argument we made in our protest), 
FERC does state that it has the authority to order MAPP's jurisdictional 
public utility members (through MAPP) to pay the full amount of refunds owed. 
 FERC directs MAPP to refund the full amounts owed and to submit a revised 
refund report.

Subject: Re: CAISO Market Stabilization Plant  

Alan,

>>> Day-Ahead & Hour-Ahead Markets

 Market separation rules aside, we should resist any mandatory Day-Ahead 
Market.  The results for day-ahead clearing markets have been bid gaming to 
influence price in the day-ahead market.  In PJM and NY-ISO parties submit 
false load and generation schedules in set price (most often this is a low 
ball load estimate),then later the true load is scheduled.  I think there is 
less of a problem with the hour-ahead market since the opportunity to submit 
a false bid to set price and then replace it later is very limited if not 
nonexistent.  

>>> Unbalance Schedules

 The general direction we are going for Eastern ISO's is to allow unbalance 
schedules in the real-time market.  Tim indicated a few weeks ago that he 
still wants this feature.  Normally there would be no imbalance penalties, 
however, when reserve margins are so slim that the system's security is in 
jeopardy, penalties would be triggered.  The result is that parties can 
choose to use the real-time market or they can choose bilateral schedules or 
a combination.  They are not compelled to do either.  As long as reserves are 
adequate, then why should we care.

>>> Unit Commitment

 Although not on your list, I think the primary problems that the Day-Ahead 
Market is trying to solve is unit commitment.  While this may be the intended 
purpose, it hasn't worked very well.  Centralized unit commitment would 
address the problem, but then the operator decisions have a large impact on 
prices without having any consequences.  We need a proposal for making sure 
that resources will be on line and that the operator knows they will be in 
place.  A possible approach may be as follows (as suggested by Mike Roan):

The Operator publishes its expected real-time price for the next 48 hours 
based on information supplied by generators regarding their availability and 
bid price (one part) and the ISO's estimate of hourly loads.  The estimates 
roll forward every hour to that a continuous two day outlook is provided to 
all market participants.  The Operator provides the demand/supply curves to 
the market so everyone has the same information.
As units are committed and load forecast is adjusted, the estimate of 
real-time prices changes, providing signals for units to use in deciding to 
commit units.  As expected price rises, more units are committed and price 
goes down.
At a given point in time, such as 4 hours ahead of real-time, the Operator 
locks units in as committed.  If there are inadequate units committed, it 
pays to add capacity (call contracts).  If not enough is voluntarily bid, the 
Operator orders units on under emergency rules contained in 
interconnection/integration agreements with the generators. 
The cost of the call contracts or of units ordered on is included in the cost 
of imbalance energy in real-time for the hours for which those costs were 
incurred.

This procedure is a continuous bid type of approach, which provides signals 
and information to the market.  It or some other procedure like it is needed 
to address the Operators concerns that it will be able to operate the system 
and to deal with the overly conservative tendencies of a not-for-profit ISO.

		 Subject: CAISO Market Stabilization Plant

Here are some initial reactions and questions to the CAISO market 
stabilization plan, which is attached.

Give me or Sue Mara your comments and then we can turn it into message points 
for  media / advocacy folks.

In addition to reviewing the plan, I listened in to part of a stakeholder 
call that occured Friday 10 a.m. PST.

DRAFT MESSAGE POINTS:

With limited exceptions, the plan does nothing to increase supply or decrease 
demand.  It primarily addresses costs and market "stability"

INTERESTING QUOTES:
 
"Over the edge into cost based regulation" Duke Power

Although the plan provides for cost control and for improving market 
"stability" (whatever that means), the ISO staffer (Byron Wortz) who 
presented the study admitted it "Will do nothing to increase supply this 
summer"

A staffer, Lorenzo,  stated (paraphrased)" all out of state suppliers are 
cost of service based and do not need to recieve market based rates

ON SPECIFICS

The Ugly:

Resource-specific cost based bid caps (RSBC or bid caps):  cost of service 
regulation that disincent supply
The ISO will hold in-state resources hostage--cuts any exports when reserves 
fall below a stated critera

Imports can only participate as price takers.  Thus if the highest-cost 
in-state resource is below the opportunity cost of power, needed imports will 
not come in:
 >>this will decrease supply!!
 >> Staffer stated ISO hopes to sign "longer term deals" if necessary to 
secure out-of-state power but acknowledged the proposal needs more work.

The Bad:

The ISO is considering pay as bid, which is complex and does not increase 
supply.  However, on the call they said they are leaing to a single price 
auction.  However, with bid caps the market will still be distorted.

The Good?:

The ISO wll implement an hourly day-ahead and hour-ahead market, essentially 
filling  a void created by the PX's demise.
 >>( Enron has strongly advocated market seperation in the past but do we 
want to consider supporting a day ahead market?)

Market separation rules (MSR).  ISO is leaning towards option 2 in which SCs 
submit bundled schedules but that market seperation would be suspended after 
congestion process is conducted; i.e., final schedules may be imbalanced.
 >>What do we think of this?

The Commission at today's FERC meeting voted out orders in the three Southeast region RTOs - Grid South, SETrans and SPP.  It was reported at the meeting that the orders will find that it is necessary for a single Southeast region RTO.  A separate order will be issued in a new docket RT01-100 initiating mediation before an ALJ (Judge Bobbie McCartney) to facilitate the formation of the single Southeast RTO.  Within one week, the settlement proceeding will begin and will continue for 45 days.  The judge thereafter must report to the Commission within 10 days including an outlline of a Southeastern RTO, milestones for completion of intermediate steps and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal.  The Commission will review the report and may issue further orders as needed.  

Grid South, SE Trans and SPP are required to participate and Grid Florida is encouraged to participate in the mediation.  All parties to any of these RTOs should also participate.

The Grid South order will also include language requiring an independent board.  After the independent board is established, it should choose an operator of the RTO.  This language should further support the idea set out in a prior SPP order granting Enron's clarification that the RTO should not make major capital expenditures for software or operating systems prior to the establishment of an independent board.

The Grid South order should also include language supporting the establishment of interconnection standards.
