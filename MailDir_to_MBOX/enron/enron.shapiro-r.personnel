Folks:

Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
Hertzberg has it at about 20%.

Hi, Rick:  It is only today that I have discovered you are my "direct boss" 
in the context of my performance review.  Since the Organizational chart 
reflects that I report to Joe Hillings and since I have not been invited to 
participate in any of your Direct Report Conference calls nor meetings, I had 
no clue until today of this change.  In fact, in the almost eleven years I 
have worked for Enron, Joe Hillings has always been my "direct boss" in the 
context of my performance reviews.

I give you this background only because I feel disadvantaged in not knowing 
this sooner.  Specifically, there is not a day that goes by when I do not 
report directly to Joe Hillings about what I am doing, copy him on memos, 
etc. whereas, I rarely, if ever, bother you with this daily reporting.  Since 
you are, in fact, my direct boss, it seems you should have been copied on all 
these memos, updates, etc. instead of or in addition to Joe Hillings plus it 
seems I should have been included in the Direct Report meetings and calls.

>From this day forward, I will copy you on everything I send to Joe Hillings.  
I assume I should continue to copy Joe on everything I send you plus now also 
add Linda Robertson?  When Linda Robertson comes on board, will I remain a 
direct report to you?  Should I now begin participating in your direct report 
regular phone calls and attend the Direct Report meetings?  Please advise.

Further, the Performance Review written policy was understood by me whereby I 
select my reviewers who must be a peer or higher, then discuss my selections 
with my boss and then together I am advised who my boss agrees will be 
reviewing me.   This time, apparently non-peers were selected to review me 
and I am unaware of the selections made for me (other than those who were 
selected who have told me about their selection.)  Rick, shouldn't just peers 
or higher rate me or has there been a policy change whereby everyone in the 
company is now having a 360 review?  Further, at least one of those selected 
to review me has not worked with me all year since our issue areas never 
intersected.  Shouldn't only those who have worked directly with me be in a 
position to review me?

Those employees whom I have worked with most closely this year who are a peer 
or higher include:  Joe Hartsoe, Tom Briggs, Joe Hillings, Dean Tarbet, Bill 
Votaw and Tom White.  I would hope you would ask these folks to conduct a 
review on my performance.

I welcome reporting to you.  I am just embarrassed to find out about this 
good news only today in that I've done little to "report" to you.  Joe 
Hillings can certainly testify to the fact he has received ample reporting 
from me.  Again, I will rectify this immediately.    Many thanks!  Cynthia

Rick, Jim: 

In a nutshell, an intelligent and bright achiever who can be of use to GA in 
many areas; global assets, EBS, and environmental come to mind very clearly.  
Her politeness, friendless, and actually openness,  indicate that she could 
be a very good team player.   She perceives her  experience in Enron as "very 
positive" and "constructive"; she worked on contractual issues related to 
Thermofloris, and Colombia-Panama Pipeline.

Risk Analytics is not her forte area, and a learning curve is needed.  
However, her abilities-clearly from the resume and from the way she explained 
the details of her experience--indicate that this curve may not be a steep 
one.  Actually, she would be a good addition to a well established Team in 
Risk Analytics in the future when legal issues and their associated risks are 
dealt with.   

I shall take the liberty to communicate with Amy again after she finishes her 
exams in the 3 weeks time and learn more about her points of strength and 
potential areas of contribution.

Of course, I shall keep you posted.

Rick --

Amr makes some good points.  Specifically, I think that having Amr report t=

Dear all -- I have put together a script and a Q&A document for Rick's use in communicating to his group his business objectives over the next few weeks for reducing expenses.  Please review and provide your comments, questions and/or concerns.  I apologize for the very short turnaround, but Rick's employee tele-conference is scheduled for Friday morning at 10:30 a.m. so we'll need to finalize the script no later than EOB tomorrow.

In addition, I've included a Q&A document that we should deliver to employees immediately after the meeting.  There are a couple of the questions we need to finalize.  For time's sake tonight, I've not included the answers to some of the benefits questions; however, those answers are already defined and not negotiable, so I just need to cut and paste them into the document.  Please review this to ensure I've covered most questions that may come up, and provide your feedback on those questions that still need to be finalized.

Rick, can we meet late Thursday to review the documents and any feedback that Sharon and Sheila provides?  I'm available any time 2:00 or later?

 

Thanks for your quick review of this information.  Please give me a call with any questions, etc.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Hi Rick,

I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership 
issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a 
leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  
This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step 
back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond 
Scott for policy and technical guidance).

I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at 
our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about 
individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the 
moment are:

People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently 
of the success of our group as a whole.
This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to 
work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.
Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional 
members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the 
nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside 
for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group 
steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings 
that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.
 Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they 
are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative 
impact on their performance reviews.

I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please 
let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these 
petty issues.

How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so 
I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with 
our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine 
regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to 
make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but 
from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.

Talk to you soon.

Sue

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve

This confirms our discussion re:  staffing issues in San Francisco:

(1) I will contact Chris Calger when he returns to Portland next week and get 
his support for the change in Sandy's reporting relationship.  I will also 
contact Jeff Dasovich and Susan Mara.  

(2) I will contact H.R. to confirm our messaging for the PRC process and the 
lattitude I have in delivering the mid-term review.  

(3) I will deliver the change in reporting relationships for Sandy so that it 
coincides with the mid-year break in the legislative cycle.

(4) We will delay any other reporting changes in the West until after the 
mid-year PRC process.

Rick:

Its been a long time and things are coming to their logical end. I thought I would briefly update you on developments here. We are all eagerly awaiting the 19th of November when in all likelihood we would be serving the Termination  Notice (TN) to the state government. Thereafter the assets would be transfered to the State Utility and we would want to proceed to London for international arbitration. There may be a few hurdles in the sense that we already have some cases lined against us in various Indian courts. Its not clear if we can proceed as smoothly as the way I have described in the initial lines.

We had an all employee meeting , a few days back, and Wade informed us of the recent developments. Post that he did indicate in no uncertain terms the future of all the employees here. Give and take I expect that our services here would be required at max till the time the TN is served, post that our contracts could be severed. Some relocations and some severances have already started and its a matter of time before my turn arrives.

I would like to explore possible future employment opportunities under you, in Houston. It would give me immense pleasure if I could in any way continue to contribute to the activities of the division. 

Any advice from you would boost my morale

Warm Regards
Ban

Rick -- here is the offer letter for Paul.  I believe it has everything noted except if we are going to allow for a house hunting trip prior to his moving.  I'm told this is usually done in conjunction with a business trip, so I'm not sure if that could be worked in for Paul.

In addition, to get any questions answered he may have about the benefits in Mexico, I would suggest that he call
Melizza Evanson, the HR Rep that is the liaison for our employees in Mexico.  She works very closely with the HR/Payroll people in Mexico and is the most knowledgeable.  Tim Callahan did say that the Benefits in the UK are greater than they are even in the US, and the benefits in the US are even greater than those in Mexico.  However, he didn't elaborate on the specifics of any particular benefits.  Melizza did say that the cost of living in Mexico is extremely low, so the employees there are provided with a driver, maids, etc. 

Anyway, take a look at the letter and let me know if you need any revisions.  And please have Paul call Melizza directly at 
(713) 345-7855 
with any questions.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

Anthony,
I will be contacting Asia Partnership regarding Regulatory Recruiting for EBS 
in Singapore on Tuesday when they return from Easter holiday.  As I 
understand from Nick, you have two finalist candidates but would like to see 
if AP can produce anyone quickly for you.  Asia Partnership will most likely 
ask you for a retainer for this search (30 - 40% of total expected fee), but 
I will find out how soon they would expect to have candidates ready for 
interview before I tell them that we're 100% interested in moving forward.  
Lilian/Chor Lim, 
I'm going to hand this over to you to manage with Lucy Marshall of AP once I 
speak with her next week.  Lets plan on introduction via telephone Tuesday or 
Wednesday depending on how quickly they can produce for us.  I'm working to 
negotiate a preferred provider agreement, but have not yet managed to get any 
fee discounts.
Thanks,
Caroline

You mentioned the other week that there may be opportunities for Mustafa in North America - Canada specifically.  I have discussed the voluntary redundancy option with Mustafa in addition to possibilities elsewhere including the US and UK renewables commercial.  (The latter would be a particularly good transition in terms of not losing his experience to date to EEL)  I have, however, managed his expectations with respect to the likelihood of these possibilities for fear of offering false hope. His CV is attached below.

Will you be free later - it would be worth catching up on progress this week.

Regards

Paul

Dear Linda,

 
I haven't been formally introduced to you, although I have seen you several 
times in the Houston offsites.  In the past 16 months, I have been working in 
Government and Regulatory Affairs group covering EBS global telecommunication 
issues.  Currently,  I am on secondment in London to help Jan Haizmann with 
European and Asian telecommunication licensing procedures. This September, I 
will be starting the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS) master program in Washington DC.  I have a strong interest in staying 
with the government affairs group and believe that a part time position in 
the Enron DC office will be complementary to my studies at SAIS. Rick Shapiro 
encouraged me to contact you directly, suggesting that you might be willing 
to meet with me and to help me identify the employment opportunities in the 
DC office.

It may be helpful for you to know that I have been working for the past two 
year for Enron. While in Houston, I had the chance to work on number of 
interesting projects, including providing financial modeling support for the 
former Enron International group.  I am familiar with deregulation process, 
especially with the recent developments in the telecommunication field.   In 
addition, working in the London office have provided me with the opportunity 
to working with the EU Commission, the UK Parliament and other lobbying 
groups.  I believe that my experience in Enron will enable me to play a 
proactive role in the DC office.   

I will be in touch with you by phone in a week.  Next month, I will be 
passing through DC & would like to set up a short 20-30 minute meeting with 
you at a mutually convenient time. 

I understand you are busy and appreciate your time. I look forward to talking 
with you soon.

Sincerely,


Xi Xi

Yes: I got through to him today and we are having lunch on Thursday 5 July: 
he is positive but wants more information about the company and what we would 
offer him. I said that at such an early stage and because he was having lunch 
with me rather than someone more senior I could only talk to him about the 
company and my impressions.  But it would be useful for me to have some sense 
of what it is that we want him to do in the Frankfurt office. Frankfurt is a 
big draw for him.

Dominik,

It was good to speak with you at the EEMF Forum; we all found your 
presentation impressive and the responses to the questions finely tuned to 
leave us thinking that we had been given priviledged access to information 
when in fact we hadn't; what a pro!

As I said, my colleague Rick Shapiro (head of our global public affairs)  was 
impressed and he was serious when he thought of you for our Frankfurt 
office.  I am sure that if you showed interest, things could move quickly (or 
even slowly, if that's what you wanted) and any particular circumstances that 
you had would be taken into account.  I can certainly attest to the welcoming 
nature of Enron.  have a think about it, and if you want to folow up, on a 
completely informal and no commitment basis, let me know.  Even if you do not 
want to leave, it's good to know what your market worth is!!

Lunch some time? 

Brendam

Sharon -- Rick has agreed that if Sandra choose COBRA medical coverage, Enron 
will pay her premiums for the 18 month period.  I need a letter/document that 
I can send to Sandra to note this.  When Sandra applies for COBRA coverage, 
there is a section that asks for Billing Information.  In that section, she 
would put 
Enron Corporation
Attn:  Jo Ann Hill, Corp Human Resources, EB 1665d
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

I think we should also put some verbiage in the letter that states upon 
enrollment in any other comparable medical coverage, she must notify us so 
COBRA coverage can be stopped.

Please let me know if you need any further information regarding this and 
when I would be able to get this letter.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

Rick:  thanks for your phone call today and for agreeing to add the names I 
requested to review me.  In addition, you asked me to remind you to please 
add Mark Taylor to my list.  I  worked with Mark this year on CEA reform but  
I had not originally listed him since our dealings were on an issue not 
assigned to me yet referred to me in my colleague's absence.  

Rick, I understand system mistakes occur but I remain concerned that I am 
being singled out and that I received no prior notification of changed 
policy.  Since no one else in my D.C. office group was subject to the system 
mistake, no one else in my immediate group will experience a 360 review.  
Further, is it possible for you to disclose who else you have asked to review 
me?  Again, I do not think it fair for people to be asked to evaluate me who 
have no knowledge of my performance.  Such a system results in a popularity 
contest and not a performance review.  

Since you agreed in August to immediately raise any concerns or problems 
directly with me and since you have not raised anything to date, I recognize 
the issues I am raising are likely moot.  However, I thought it important to 
register my concerns with you as they occurred.  Many thanks for your 
immediate response to my concerns.  I greatly appreciate it.  Cynthia

You report directly to Joe as of today- it's a systems issue,i.e; mistake ( 
your's  is not the only mistake) that has you on the review list for me. As 
of Monday Nov. 6, 2000, you report directly to Linda Robertson. I believe a 
360 degree review is the objective in this process- In addition to reviewers 
that I have selected, I will add the names you have sugggested, some of which 
I had already included. Please feel free to page me at 888-740-9949 if you

Subject: Performance Review

Hi, Rick:  It is only today that I have discovered you are my "direct boss" 
in the context of my performance review.  Since the Organizational chart 
reflects that I report to Joe Hillings and since I have not been invited to 
participate in any of your Direct Report Conference calls nor meetings, I had 
no clue until today of this change.  In fact, in the almost eleven years I 
have worked for Enron, Joe Hillings has always been my "direct boss" in the 
context of my performance reviews.

I give you this background only because I feel disadvantaged in not knowing 
this sooner.  Specifically, there is not a day that goes by when I do not 
report directly to Joe Hillings about what I am doing, copy him on memos, 
etc. whereas, I rarely, if ever, bother you with this daily reporting.  Since 
you are, in fact, my direct boss, it seems you should have been copied on all 
these memos, updates, etc. instead of or in addition to Joe Hillings plus it 
seems I should have been included in the Direct Report meetings and calls.

>From this day forward, I will copy you on everything I send to Joe Hillings.  
I assume I should continue to copy Joe on everything I send you plus now also 
add Linda Robertson?  When Linda Robertson comes on board, will I remain a 
direct report to you?  Should I now begin participating in your direct report 
regular phone calls and attend the Direct Report meetings?  Please advise.

Further, the Performance Review written policy was understood by me whereby I 
select my reviewers who must be a peer or higher, then discuss my selections 
with my boss and then together I am advised who my boss agrees will be 
reviewing me.   This time, apparently non-peers were selected to review me 
and I am unaware of the selections made for me (other than those who were 
selected who have told me about their selection.)  Rick, shouldn't just peers 
or higher rate me or has there been a policy change whereby everyone in the 
company is now having a 360 review?  Further, at least one of those selected 
to review me has not worked with me all year since our issue areas never 
intersected.  Shouldn't only those who have worked directly with me be in a 
position to review me?

Those employees whom I have worked with most closely this year who are a peer 
or higher include:  Joe Hartsoe, Tom Briggs, Joe Hillings, Dean Tarbet, Bill 
Votaw and Tom White.  I would hope you would ask these folks to conduct a 
review on my performance.

I welcome reporting to you.  I am just embarrassed to find out about this 
good news only today in that I've done little to "report" to you.  Joe 
Hillings can certainly testify to the fact he has received ample reporting 
from me.  Again, I will rectify this immediately.    Many thanks!  Cynthia

I received an offer this past Friday for a position with EES very unexpectantly.  I've accepted the position this morning .  The group would like me start immediately but I know I need to get with Becky on a few things and finish out a project I've been working on.  

Do you guys have a time frame in mind?  I'm thinking my last day could be the 15th of November.

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve

Rick, thanks for seeing me individually on Friday. 

There has not yet been any announcement for EBS. I welcome my new reporting 
to Sue Nord, but I would like to see some kind of official note on the new 
structure. I would like to know what my budget for Europe is and what the new 
procedures are for contracting outside counsels, or consultants.

As you may know, I have recently expressed interest with Anthony Duenner  for 
the vacant position with EBS Singapore. This mainly because there are more 
challenging regulatory issues at hand in the Asia/Pacific region and I have 
been able to familiarize myself with some of them, whereas in Europe this is 
not the case.

However, there are also some opportunities here, namely supporting Paul 
Hennemeyer on a part time basis. This mainly because my previous experience 
as competition lawyer might enable me to co-manage some of the court 
procedures currently pending. The recruitment for a German person with legal 
training only failed recently.

 I am basically open to pursue either opportunity, depending on what the 
company wants to me to do. My current job is for EBS Europe is not any longer 
a full time position, since I have secured all necessary licenses and our 
business is widely deregulated.

I copy Sue since I want this to be as transparent as possible & due to 
extensive travelling we have not been able to speak.

Rick,

Unfortunately, contrary to the performance management system's reply (see 
below), performance reviews are not confidential in the DC office as the 
office manager has access to the passwords of some of the Vice Presidents.  

I would like to comply with your request to give a performance review for 
Cynthia Sandherr, but unless I can send it to you in a confidential envelope 
I have no guarantee it will not be seen at some point by my colleagues.  
(Your are listed as her supervisor according to the PEP system.)  This poses 
a problem for me.

Your advice is welcome.

After almost 13 years with Enron, I've decided to pursue other opportunities 
outside of the company.  While the problems in India remain challenging and I 
have enjoyed my tenure here, the job I've been offered is really too good to 
pass up.  Thus, please consider this e:mail as formal notice of my intention 
to resign from the company, effective close of business June 16, 2001.

Rick, Schnichels is positive, but has concern about timing (not now, but in 6 
months) and also, exactly what would he do? I said that we could arrange for 
him to meet the right people, but the ball is in his court for the moment; he 
wants to speak to his wife. Definately wants to moe to Frankfurt. Brendan

Rob Milnthorp have been discussing whether we want to look for a new 
regulatory person in Toronto.  We are leaning towards starting with a new 
face.  Give me a call to discuss.

Rick

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say t=
hat despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few mo=
nths, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no sm=
all part, to the great people I share this place with.=20

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, =
I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends =
and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: =
Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family,=
 but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Theref=
ore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have=
 decided not accept the offer.=20

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along=
. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday.=20

Best regards,=20
Paul

Subject:=09American Thanksgiving
Importance:=09High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Guillermo:  At this time I cannot tell you what is going to happen with your L1 visa, as I have not been instructed to give out any information regarding visas.  Until we know something more, it is a difficult question to answer.

However, in answer to your questions:

1.	You cannot transfer an L1 visa to another company, as it is Enron specific.
2.	You can stay in the US for a short time to pack up and move things.   You cannot stay indefintely, as you will be out of status.
3.	If your wife gets a working visa, then she will be able to stay legally, but I imagine you would then be her dependent.
4.	Alternatively, you can look for a job and get an HIB visa for yourself and and H4 visa for your wife (she still cannot work on an H4 visa). 

Once we know more about what is going on, everyone will have a better understanding of what advice to give to visa holders.

I would appreciate if you could tell me what is going to happen with my L1-Visa (and the L2 of my wife), if the worst case scenarios for Enron become true.
In particular:
Could Enron transfer my Visa to other US company?
How long could I stay in the US if Enron terminates my contract?
Could we stay in the country if my wife gets a legal job as a teacher?
Do I have any other alternative?

Thank you very much.
Guillermo

Rick

I was in Zurich on Friday and had an interesting discussion with Mauro 
Renggli - head of our office there. The discussion and
suggestions (below) were wholly at Mauro's instigation.

Over the past several months, Viviana has been tracking development in the 
Swiss market and providing updates etc. to Mauro and his 
team. He seems quite pleased with the work she is performing for him and has 
asked if I would be supportive of Viviana transferring to 
the Zurich office for 3+ months to work with his team. I told him I would 
think about it. From my perspective, this may be a very useful
step: 1) It allows her to get closer to a market she is already tracking for 
reg. affairs and which is headed for some important developments
ove the coming 6 months, 2) she is already a known and appreciated quantity 
there, and 3) most importantly, she would be able to 
work more closely with the small team there and perhaps get some of the 
additional support and guidance that I have not been able to 
provide.  Viviana has apprarently already voiced her interest in working in 
Switzerland.

Can you please call me before you speak to Viviana. Would welcome your take 
on this.

Thanks, Paul

As you have been notified, your last day at work will be 11/30/01.  However, the terms of your separation agreement remain in effect and your actual termination date will be the date listed in your document.   You will still be noted as an "employee" and continue to have access to email and voicemail remotely; however, for all intents, you will no longer be conducting business activities.    

In addition, Sonja Galloway will be contacting you to schedule a telephone exit interview sometime during the week of November 26th.  During this session, we will review your exit package, including benefits, etc., and will discuss arrangements to turn in all Enron assets (i.e., AMEX cards, calling cards, building badge, parking cards, etc.).  Also, please start preparing a final expense report so we will be able to close out any remaining expenses you may have.  We will be going over your entire exit package, so please review prior to the exit interview so any questions you may have can be resolved.

Again, I will be out of the office next week, but will be available by cell phone --> 713-503-5046.  Also, Sonja Galloway will be in the office Monday and Tuesday and would be able to assist you.

I wish you a very happy Thanksgiving holiday.  
Jo Ann

Private message.
Cynthia has dramatically increased her attacks on me in recent days--I've had 
"warnings" from a number of people.
She's openly saying that I have no Hill experience, she has attacked my use 
of outside consultants, she has challenged my handling of the BLM/Forest 
Service issue.
Today I heard about a message she sent to someone outside the company, 
"suggesting" to them that they never meet with me alone, but always have 
Chris Long present, and further that any communications with me in the future 
copy Scott and Donald.  In short, she's now trying to undercut my authority 
not just inside the office, but outside the office as well.
I've requested a meeting Thursday morning with Joe and Cynthia.  My strategy 
will be to say to Cynthia "if there's anything you want to say to me, now is 
the time," and to turn to Joe and say "You supervise both of us and I 
appreciate your being here to help us sort this out."
But my patience is wearing very, very thin.

Subject: Re: mike grimes  

Nick -- This certainly reflects the discussion you and I had on the telephone 
on Friday and seems like a good plan going forward.  I was surprised to hear 
that Mike has been directing such a large percentage of his focus towards EBS 
matters (I do not recall being told of this arrangement  by Jan or Mark) but 
I appreciate having the support in Japan and Mike can be quite helpful in 
taking a look at  Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea as well.  He has been doing a 
decent job and we will reevaluate again later in the year his ongoing support 
of EBS in the region.  Thanks for the follow up.

On another matter, I am working on lining up one brief meeting for Jeff 
Skilling while he is in Tokyo on 14 May -- Jim Weisser and I will coordinate 
with you.  Thanks for your help on these matters.

Anthony, good speaking with you last week. This note is to confirm a couple 
of matters regarding Mike.

With the departure of David Merrill in January this year, Mark Schroeder 
moved Mike across to cover EBS regulatory work more or less on full time 
basis. Although the time varies from week to week,  Mike currently spends 
about 75% of his time on EBS matters. The balance is charged out to Enron 
Japan and other Enron entities with an interest in Japan, such as Networks 
and Global Markets.

At the same time, Mike's expat assignment was extended for an additional 6 
months until 31 December 2001. The possibility of extending the assignment 
beyond 31 December 2001 was discussed in general terms and will be a matter 
for consideration by the interested parties at the appropriate time.

To date, Mike has been covering Japan only, reporting to Jan Haizmann on EBS 
regulatory matters. Following our discussion, Mike's responsibilities will 
extend to include South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mike is of course happy 
to extend his responsibilities. Once the new regulatory hire is on board in 
Singapore, Mike will report to that person on EBS regulatory matters. Mike 
will continue to have a dual reporting role on regulatory issues related to 
Japan.

If this accords with your understanding, particularly the preceding 
paragraph, I will send a copy of the note to personnel, Joe Hirl and Rick 
Shapiro.

kind regards

Thanks for the note...but with all of the cost cutting pressures and the reality that we still have more people with a retail focus than will survive the combination, I have to tell you that a consulting or contract arrangement won't work. As a friend and a colleague, the best thing for all of us is to move on.

Rick - 

Your conference call this morning was quite encouraging from the standpoint of the GA Group and I was sincerely pleased to hear that, for the most part, jobs will be saved.

I found it interesting to hear you report that Dynegy has expressed interest in Enron's retail business, which has prompted me to write to you to follow-up on our discussion of a week ago.  Clearly a lot has changes in the past week and it seems that the deal with Dynegy should alleviate the paralysis that was understandably taking hold while there was no plan for the future of the company. With that in mind, I wonder if perhaps you might be in a better position to consider the option of utilizing me on a consultant basis in 2002.

Rick, I don't believe there is anyone in the group that has a better handle on the retail issues or has provided better commercial support, and therefore I believe it would make good business sense to consider ways to keep me associated with the group.  Although I can appreciate how busy you are with other priorities, I wanted to raise the question again now while the subject is fresh in your mind and while I am still very much involved with the business. 

As I have indicated, I would be willing to consider a consulting arrangement for part or all of next year. This would ensure continuity of coverage as the merger transition proceeds. 

I hope you will give the idea serious consideration. 

Thanks, 

Frank

Sensitivity:	Confidential

Paul, sorry that you were in meetings when I was not yesterday morning.  Since I am on vacation (or at least trying to be) I didn't go back into the office looking for you later in the day.  The following are my last thoughts regarding Government and Reg Affairs people and organisational issues.  I will leave them with you and the others do with as you like.  John T.

0)	Background:  Cross-border issues in power and EU vs. the Germans and Dutch in Gas will likely be the big issues in the
	next 12 to 18 months on the continent.  We have the potential to add as much value via GovRegAffairs activity on the
	continent in the next 12 months as through any commercial activity.  Much of this activity will have to be EU focused.  In
	power especially we have gotten almost - not quite all - but almost all that we can hope to get exclusively from national 
	level work.  (Italy and Spain are of course big exceptions.)  Gas is and always has been much more of a Europe-wide
	theme than a national theme.  We will have to carefully manage our public GRA message and approach to take tough
	positions without creating unneeded enemies.  We should look for local national allies where possible.  We cannot be the	
	only voice in any country supporting a major position.  If there are no local forces supporting the position, we need to
	find/create some allies.  It cannot be Enron vs. Germany; or, even worse, Enron and EU vs Germany (or Switzerland, or
	wherever).  Loss of momentum at this time would be an error; however, focus would be an accomplishment.  Each issue
	will need a simultaneous AND co-ordinated EU and local effort. 

1)	Styles and the EU Office:  I am convinced that Peter Styles is the most important single continent based GRA asset at
	this time and for the next 18 to 24 months.  Everyone including me has their own stories about Peter - not all positive.
	But he is the right man, at the right time at the right place.  Within the bounds of what is managerially and financially
	responsible, it is important to keep the Styles-force working for Enron at the EU level.  Beyond his linguistic skills he
	understands absolutely what Enron needs to make money on the continent.  Of course, we should begin thinking about
	Peter's EVENTUAL retirement.  We should never allow anyone to be permanently as essential as Peter has become.
	BUT, right now he is essential.

2)	German GRA Activities:  Permanent resource (100%) should become Jan Haizmann (or however you spell it).  He is
	abrupt and offensive to Anglo-Saxons - but then, he is very German - and the directness that some of us have come to
	appreciate about the Germans is often mistaken as rudeness by those who have not worked with them much.  I have gotten
	consistently positive feed-back from senior German colleagues especially about his performance with senior German
	officials such as the head of the Federal Cartel Office.  My understanding is that Haizmann wants to move to Frankfurt.  If
	this is true, I would encourage it.  There are no German official offices (other than the Embassy) in London.

	We have, I believe, all agreed that Paul Hennemeyer is more of a self-propelled project guy than a team player.  Thus, I 
	would agree that probably mid- to long-term he should move on within Enron to other Hennemeyer sized projects.  But,
	in the immediate future, he has several very important projects going on in German speaking Europe.  Additionally, with
	a new more profound emphasis on getting the gas market opened up, with renewed interest in Austria and with the 
	necessity to engage somewhat in Switzerland (regarding transit), it does not look to me like we should let Paul leave too
	quickly.  As a somewhat mentor to Haizmann, passing off relationships in an orderly manner, ensuring that projects do not
	fall through the cracks, etc. there is still much for Paul to do. It will be, however, necessary to give him a clear picture of
	his future or Enron will lose him entirely.  An open ended "project boy" job will not keep Paul indefinitely.  Let's not lose
	Paul to Enron even if we have to slowly move him out of Europe.

3)	Lars Atenhoefer:  Lars is much in demand by Gregor and others for his unique brand of consulting based commercial work.
	I continue to believe that he would be a very powerful less than 50% GRA front-end for Switzerland.  He would be glad to
	do that but for the next time will clearly keep his commercial focus.  Switzerland does not/will not justify full-time GRA
	support; but, we must get more engaged there.  Less for our Swiss business than for our cross-border business and for
	continued grid and water power access.  The liberalisation vote next year will fail if it is held. Everything going on in
	Switzerland now by real players is based on the failure of that vote. Important to work with Gregor and Eric to ensure that
	Lars continues to see a variety of opportunities in Enron.  His academic and professional preparation is perfect for a GRA
	person.  He belongs to Gregor and Eric.  I recommend talking with them about him.

4)	Doug Wood:  I do not see a mid- or long-term role for Doug Wood on the continent.  He only speaks English and currently
	has little feel for the continent - which is neither American nor Britain.  English only players will ALWAYS fall behind
	locals.  In every country where we need to have an impact, the impact MUST be in local language and should be with a
	local national.  GRA work is political (i.e., irrational and emotional). Brits are Europeans and Americans are people too 
	doesn't wash with local politicians.  The fact that some locals are willing to speak English is a trick.  The real business -
	particularly regulatory and political business - is always done in local language.  Local GRA people, local country 
	managers, local lawyers, etc. are not going to suffer an English only player gladly.  Let's be realistic about this.  Doug
	Wood has no future on the continent.

5)	Research Specialists (and other such creatures):  We should not have such creatures.  That is a go nowhere job and it
	attracts go nowhere people.  More seriously, it would be a fantastic place for a direct out of the university eager Analyst
	to get an introduction to Enron before hitting a commercial desk.  That will also help ensure that future commercial teams
	will better understand the role of GRA.  The continuity argument doesn't wash.  Many commercial Analyst and Associates
	rotate leaving continuity problems behind.  I am getting rid of my personal Research Specialist and will farm the work out
	in the future to rotating Analysts (watch out Gregor and Eric).  Reg Affairs should get rid of all of their Research Positions.

	We must ensure that enough first rotation Analysts are assigned to this task. I have several times in several different 
	countries seen Analyst level work outsourced to very highly paid consultants simply because GRA didn't have any
	resource.  Besides being expensive and wasteful, this costs a would be Analyst a great learning experience.  Perhaps
	each commercial country manager and each country specific GRA person should share a research analyst as a first
	round rotator.  All of our senior relationship work, etc. would be done much more professionally if that were the case and
	our consulting bills would fall.

6)	Country Managers:  Each country manager (such as Radmacher, Renggli, a hopefully soon to be new Italian one, etc.)
	should be spending a meaningful (ca. 10 to 15%) of their time on GRA activities.  The commercial country manager should
	by definition have the best feel in Enron for what we need to do how and with whom in his/her country.  They must be told
	that GRA leadership - together with you and the gas and power leadership executives - is part of their job. A new market
	manager such as the future Italian country manager should consider GRA leadership an essential part of getting their
	market off of the ground.  Any commercial country manager who wants to 100% outsource GRA leadership in his/her
	country should be replaced.  Further, this should also reduce the need for too many VP and Sr Director level GRA people
	at this time.

7)	Italy:  A Spaniard that speaks Italian is a good SHORT-term solution for Italy.  If we successfully hire a new Italian country
	manager, he should get heavily involved in this initially.  Eventually, we will need a real-live Italian in Italy but we probably 
	don't need to look for him/her this quarter.  

8)	Local Politics, Local Language, Local National:  Should apply to:  Germany, The Netherlands, Austria/Switzerland 	(perhaps together, but then done by a German), France(&, perhaps Belgium), Spain, Italy.  I cannot imagine that we need any 
	resource in former Communist Europe - Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, etc.  

I have a lot of much more minor thoughts and suggestions; but, I am going to make this my final and conclusive list of GRA suggestions.  I look forward to working with you in this regard.  Already have engagements in the GRA space in Switzerland and Germany this year and am sure that there are many to come. Congratulations in you new role and best of wishes.  JT

Rick, thanks for the note. I will be in touch with you and Stefan Diescher on 
this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the "has issues" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.
Thanks, Paul

Richard S. Shapiro
Managing Director & Senior Vice President
Government Affairs - The Americas
Enron Corp.
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002-7361

Dear Richard:

Thanks again for taking the time for our telephone call last Wednesday. I
thoroughly enjoyed our talk. As per your request, I've attached a copy of my
CV for your review.

What I hope and believe you will realize as you review my qualifications is
that my skills, experience, problem-solving capability and drive to succeed
uniquely position me to make an immediate and lasting positive contribution
to Enron's government relations and public affairs activities at many
levels.

Firstly, my experience within the Ontario government and the network of
contacts I've developed as a result would be of immediate value to Enron. We
both know that an intense, coordinated and targeted effort will be required
from now to beyond the next provincial election to ensure that the Ontario
market opens successfully and remains open. My unique understanding of the
key players and issues involved in the opening of the Ontario market could
be of significant value to your company through this period.

Secondly, even as local market-opening events play themselves out in
Ontario, a broader set of potential opportunities is appearing for Enron
continentally, with the Bush administration's push for a hemispheric energy
policy. The unveiling of the proposed package by the President has ignited a
continent-wide debate that will have significant impact on the shape and
substance of the policies finally adopted by governments across the
hemisphere. Clearly, it is in Enron's interest to participate in and shape
this debate, to ensure that the final policy packages enhance your economic
interests. To meet this goal, a clear set of objectives must be identified,
an effective strategy to accomplish them developed and a coordinated,
sustained campaign planned and executed. My understanding of the varied
issues and actors at play in this debate, coupled with my understanding of
how to strategically plan and manage persuasion campaigns would be of
significant value to Enron as you prepare to meet this goal on a continental
basis.

Lastly, in addition to providing value to Enron both locally and
continentally in the specific ways described above, I would appreciate most
the opportunity to provide value to your company at a truly macro level, by
helping you participate and succeed in the ongoing global debate on the
ideology of open markets, entrepreneurial activity and free trade. The
ideological conflict between advocates of the state and champions of
individual freedoms and choice can be seen at the heart of all of Enron's
challenges, be they in Ontario, India or elsewhere, and the debate - with
its' significant global implications - is far from over. History clearly
demonstrates that opening markets and freeing entrepreneurial and consumer
activity is the key to enhancing the quality of life for individuals across
the globe. By pursuing these noble goals, companies like Enron are
performing a global public good. Putting my skills to work for Enron in this
global debate would truly be my pleasure.

Once again, I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss with you my
qualifications and how I can assist Enron in achieving your government
relations and public affairs goals. Please feel free to contact me at your
convenience.

Yours truly,



Bill Hawkins

Courtney -

I am pleased to offer my comments on how Enron responded to the events of September 11th.  To give you some background, I was at the Houston attending meetings at the Enron Building on the 47th floor, when news of the tragedy hit. I was originally scheduled to return to New Jersey that evening but as a result of the airport closings, I did not get home until late Friday afternoon when I was fortunate enough to be on the first of a number of chartered planes that Enron utilized to facilitate getting employees back to their homes or other destinations.  

The following is a brief outline on how I was affected and how the Company and various employees responded:

Shortly after the incident, an announcement was made on the PA system indicating that the Enron building was in no danger, but that anyone who felt uncomfortable being at the office was free to leave. This was reassuring particularly for those who were uneasy being on the higher floors. The Company wisely shut down the building late that morning so there was no question that employees were free to go. 
Right from the start, management made it clear that we could do whatever was needed to get home and that the company would be very flexible with respect to travel expenses during the period while we were unable to get home and in travel getting home. 
An e-mail from Rick Shapiro, sent to everyone in the Government Affairs expressing his concerns for everyone, served to reinforced what my immediate supervisor, and to say the least was reassuring.
By early Thursday, the Company was already making plans to utilized corporate plains to try to facilitate travel for those of us that were stuck one place or another, and I was pleasantly surprised when I received a call from Ginger Dernehl, saying that I was on the list of people going on the corporate jet up to the New York area whenever the airports opened, and that I had to be "ready to go on short notice".  
Knowing of three other employees from the New Jersey area that were in the same predicament as I was, I gave their names to Ginger Dernehl and Maureen McVicker who were coordinating the list of those needing flights, and they immediately got them on the list as well. 
As it turned-out the airports never opened on Thursday, so everything was put on-hold for another day.  However, it was clear that everyone was doing what ever they could, and the thought that kept running through my mind was, "What a great company to work for!".
The next day (Friday) I arrived at the Office early only to learn that although some commercial air travel had resumed, the ban on corporate air travel was still in effect. My alternative at that point was a Continental Flight to Philadelphia, but whether or not it would actually go was still a question. What I did not know was that the Company was already working on possible chartered flights anticipating that chartered flights might resume before corporate flights.
Sure enough, just as I was about to leave to go to Intercontinental Airport, not knowing what nightmarish delays I might encounter, I got that call that a chartered flight was leaving for Albany, NY ASAP and I had to be at 3 Allen Center right away because there was a van waiting to take me and seven other Enron employees to Hobby Airport. 
About four hours later we arrived at Albany Airport, where there were two cars waiting to take us to our various destinations. 

Although, it was frustrating at times, not knowing when I would actually get home and see my family, the genuine concern shown by everyone involved was so reassuring that it greatly minimized whatever inconvenience I was experiencing.  "What a great company to work for!"

If you have any questions or need more details, give me a call.

Frank

Frank- I work in Corp. Internal communications and am compiling information for Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for entry. Fortune has asked us to submit a section on how we responded to the tragedy and challenges on Sept. 11.  Maureen McVicker told me that you were on the chartered Enron flight to NJ.  We are asking employees who were affected by the tragedy to write a brief response stating how you were affected and what Enron or your supervisor did to help.  

If you have time or are comfortable writing this, please let me know.  I must receive the brief by Oct. 16.  Your name will not be included on your submission.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Jo Ann,

I will be forwarding the November Ad Hoc Grants to Executive Comp on Friday, October 12.    If Rick Shapiro decides to submit the proposed Ad Hocs for November, I need them this Thursday so that I can have them ready for his signature on Friday.

THANKS,

What do you think about something like this in response to the layoff question?  It could become our new "standard corporate policy."

Karen -- 

Here's the safest statement I know for our situation as it relates to employment:

"We do not speculate about future employment levels.  If and when we have ever have changes affecting employees, we tell them first."

(Of course, we'll need to pretend that we didn't break the Europe layoff on Dow Jones!)

After our very useful meeting with you yesterday, Sophie, and your HR 
colleague (Georgina? - I didn't get her surname), I have received from 
Viviana this follow up e-mail to a short conversation I had with her last 
week. You will recall that Paul stated his expectations at our meeting about 
the outcome of Viviana's next performance review. She has effectively started 
explaining her grievances to me. Your advice would be welcome.

Hello Peter, 

hope you're fine. 

I'm wondering whether it would be possible for you to call me today, because 
I would like to continue with you the discussion we started last week when I 
was in London.

I have to admit that I'm quite worried and I do not know what to expect. 

Thank you very much in advance. 

Viviana

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY EDITS TO THIS Email.  I want to send it to the DC staff.

Out of super super precaution, Enron security and others in Houston have recommended that personnel in the DC office be tested for Anthrax exposure.  They do not think there is a problem, but nonetheless recommended that we take this step.  I am awaiting word on where we should go for the test.  Also, please let Carolyn Cooney know if you have had any visitors to the DC office, who have been to Capitol Hill in the last three weeks. 

Again, this is strictly out of precaution, as we strongly believe there is NOT a problem.  In the meantime, while normal business will not be possible with Capitol Hill, let me encourage everyone to continue working on those internal projects we can get done and have been waiting for a quiet moment to do so.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Thanks Rick.
I will call her later and suggest:
 1. Get face to face with Paul (difficult because his appearances in 
Frankfurt office have been rare last six months, and when he is there she 
complains of little communication, virtually no involvement.)
 2. Speak Stephan Diescher, Frankfurt HR. (I have been advised by London HR 
not to offer myself on a continuing basis as "confidante", since this may 
encourage her to avoid confronting Paul as her direct supervisor with her 
grievances.)
 3. Avail herself of your offer.

It was supposed to have been happening ever since Andy has been in our group.  I don't have a cost center for Lloyd.  His HR rep is Kim Melodick.  Thanks

Rick:

Hope it is not getting too hot. I actually hadn't received anything to date in the way of basic package and therefore hadn't 
gotten back to you or Jaime. If something was sent that I missed, please re-send it.  I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon (Thursday) if that works for you. The atmosphere at Enron Europe (incl. reg. affairs) is pretty poor these days as the axe falls. It is genuinely unfortunate that we are getting hit as hard as we are and are really losing some good people. I trust you guys will  be spared. Take care

Hasta manana,

I sent an email to Madeline Fox in London to enlist her help with a relo package.  In addition, I talked to Susan Helton who kind of oversees the payroll accounting function.  She suggested that Tim Callahan put Paul in touch with the consultants we use in Mexico regarding tax questions.  I have a call into Tim as well.  Both know that we are shooting for an 11/16/01 effective date.

Kim Melodick's group will help in preparing the final offer letter and coordinating everything with Paul as they are the liaisons with the folks in Monterrey.
I'll followup with both today/tomorrow.

Rick -- Here are a couple of documents for your review for the potential transfer of Paul to Mexico.  I have a call in to Kim Melodick, in particular regarding the paragraph on Christmas Bonus and vacation premium.  In addition, I have a call in to Tim Callahan to discuss the transition process from an legal perspective -- VISA requirements, work permits, etc.

I'll keep you posted on the results of our discussions.
Thanks.
