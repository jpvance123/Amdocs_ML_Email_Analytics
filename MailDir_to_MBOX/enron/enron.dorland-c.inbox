Possibly, she's got dark hair that's just above her shoulders. I don't really
recall if there was anyone else coming in at the same time.
How's Dan? Did you guys do anything last night?
Is there a plan yet for tomorrow?

Title: A Moving Supply and Demand Picture

***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

Hello Chris,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday, swamped here at work.

How was cooking class?  Are you going to be the next up and coming Emrill?
I am interested to here how they recommend making stock.  For me it has
always been good 'ol Campbell's broth and add from there! Pathetic or what?

Saturday sounds good.  Open for suggestions.

Talk with you soon!

***********************************************************************

LOOKING FOR THE VALUE IN ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Corporate leaders often found it difficult to determine if environmental
strategies are paying off. As a broader set of corporate stakeholders
influences the shape of environmental strategy, corporate leaders regularly
encounter conflicting evaluations of their performance and frequently lack the
evidence to justify changes in strategy.

*  Increasing shareholder value is the ultimate success factor but corporations
cannot easily demonstrate a direct link between how an environmental strategy
is implemented and shareholder value.

*  Corporations are searching for proxy indicators that often blend the
quantitative and the intuitive from both internal and external sources.

*  Recognizing that a broader set of evaluation tools are required reduces the
frustration of searching for the perfect performance measure and, in the long
term, improves assessment efforts.

There is a tug-o-war in the market between the crisis in confidence caused =
by the Enron debacle and the increasingly positive nature of the economic d=
ata. First, let's chat about the Enron fall-out.
The market seems to be suffering from a nasty case of Enron-itis, as some o=
f the talking heads have called the recent negative sentiment in the market=
. Clearly something changed with the bankruptcy of Enron. It is the largest=
 US bankruptcy ever. There are not one, but two official governmental inves=
tigations of the company and further investigations are likely. The bankers=
, accountants and the lawyers are also going to get a hard look. What has t=
he market particularly bothered is the glaring oversight by Arthur Anderson=
 (AA), one of the big five accounting firms. Delta Airlines has been using =
AA for over 50 years and they are looking for a new auditor. Also, the cred=
it rating agencies dropped the ball too. One of them actually upgraded Enro=
n's debt a few weeks before its demise. What is the investing public to thi=
nk? Who can you trust? Generally, investors understand that the Street's ad=
vice needs to be viewed with a critical eye, but the accountants were suppo=
sed to be looking out for investors. It certainly makes you say hmmmmm...
The market hates uncertainty and the level of uncertainty has increased gre=
atly and it is not likely to dissipate for some time. Imagine the discussio=
ns at the other accounting firms. Companies are not going to be able to sli=
p anything by their accountants from now on. Standards are going to be toug=
hened up and that may cause some pain for companies that have pushed the en=
velope in the past. In addition, the market is going to search and destroy =
every company that has Enron-like qualities. Off-balance sheet partnerships=
 or structures, complicated financial statements and foreign domiciled tax =
structures. It started almost right away with the decimation of Enron's com=
petitors, Williams (WMB), El Paso (EP), Mirant (MIR) and Calpine (CPN), who=
 have had to sell assets and issue stock in order to repair their balance s=
heets. Some of those companies are trading as if we will never need power o=
r natural gas again (EP is my favourite among these companies, as you know)=
. Next, the market had its day or so with the asbestos-infected companies a=
nd then more recently proceeded to anyone with off-balance sheet assets or =
a history of accounting indiscretions. We had better get used to this sort =
of roller-coaster existence. With over 6,000 hedge funds, a hyper-active me=
dia and market information available 24/7, the witch hunts will continue. S=
till, it is important to note a few things:=20
First, not all companies with off-balance sheet items are guilty of transgr=
essions and not every company that acquires others for a living (a la Tyco)=
 violates standard accounting principles. In fact, nobody has proven (yet) =
that Tyco has done anything improper. The risk of impropriety makes people =
sell, not the fact.
Second, regardless of whether your company is guilty of doing anything nast=
y, if it plays in the same sand-box as a company that attracts the ire of i=
nvestors, it is going down. Period. Full stop. No matter if it is guilty of=
 anything or not. These are market events not business events. Consider the=
 pain and suffering experienced by El Paso (EP) thanks to Enron or Viacom (=
VIA.b) thanks to Haliburton (HAL) and its asbestos exposure. Viacom bought =
CBS which owned Westinghouse once upon a time, but that did not stop the st=
ock from getting pasted even though it is insured and reserved up the wazoo=
 ('up the wazoo' is a technical term signifying a significant amount).
Third, emotions and sentiment can push stock prices around a great deal in =
the short term, but over the long term, stock prices are determined by a co=
mpany's ability to generate cash. The best opportunities are likely to come=
 from buying companies with low debt levels that are relatively free of con=
troversy, but have been beaten up because they resemble another company wit=
h a real problem. Biovail (BVF), Viacom (VIA.b), El Paso (EP), etc. However=
, each of these names also comes with an increased risk profile as a result=
 of the market's heightened sensitivity to 'issues' (accounting, asbestos, =
debt levels, litigation, etc.).=20
On the economic front, the data seems to be point to an economic recovery t=
hat is already underway.=20
Consumer confidence rose from 94.6 to 97.3 in January and was up for the se=
cond straight month. The index is now above the pre-September 11 level. Als=
o the expectations component of the index was the highest in over a year, s=
uggesting that consumer spending should continue to hold up well.=20
Durable Goods orders rose in December and importantly the ex-transportation=
 orders rose for a third month in a row, the longest streak of gains in 4 y=
ears.=20
New home sales rose stronger than expected and taken together with last wee=
k's existing home sales, total home sales were above 6.1 million (annualize=
d) and stable.=20
Today, the unemployment rate fell to 5.6% and the 4-week moving average of =
jobless claims fell to its lowest level since August; and the ISM (NAPM) in=
dex came in at 49.9 vs. 50.0 expected and new orders remained above 50, ind=
icating order volume is expanding.=20
Finally, on the international front, the German Business Confidence index r=
ose and is now close to its pre-September 11 level.=20
Unfortunately, Japan continues to struggle. The Japanese unemployment rate =
rose to a record high 5.6% and real wage-earning household spending fell 4.=
4% compared to last year. Both figures were worse than expected and the dro=
p in household spending does not bode well the prospects of an economic rec=
overy. Also, the yen continues to slide as confidence in the government and=
 the economy wanes. The Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31st and there i=
s widespread concern that the country's banks will have to mark down the va=
lue of more loans and investments, potentially pushing some of them into ba=
nkruptcy. Of course, a number of bankruptcies would be a good thing much li=
ke the S&L crisis was for the US in the early 1990s. A cathartic cleansing =
followed by an audible flush could lead to a great buying opportunity. Stay=
 tuned.

Financials - The US banks are trading very poorly - no wonder. Credit quali=
ty, which everybody knew was bad, has turned out to be at least as nasty as=
 expected or worse. PNC Financial (PNC) had to restate its earnings when th=
e SEC forced the company to consolidate 3 subsidiaries, K-Mart (KM) filed f=
or chapter 11, Global Crossings (GX) shuts its doors, and today, the 2nd bi=
ggest European cable company defaulted on $6.4 billion in debt and preferre=
d stock. When you add these events on to the Enron scenario, it makes inves=
tors of all kinds hold a bit more cash, a few more government bonds and a l=
ittle less equity. This is the kind of pain that is quite typical for the t=
rough of the credit cycle. As you know, JP Morgan (JPM) has been a recommen=
ded stock for many quarters, however it looks like it will be removed from =
the US Focus List as it has broken our technical screen. The stock remains =
buy or strong buy rated around the Street and a great deal of bad news woul=
d seem to be already priced into the stock. However, the risk of further ne=
gative credit events seems quite high, and as a result, we suggest that new=
 money go into Citigroup (C), which is trading at just under 14x 2002 EPS v=
s. its historical range of about 12x to 20x. Out anlayst's comments on Sun =
Life (SLC) suggest this is a name we should continue to accumulate.
Sun Microsystems (SUNW) is under pressure following negative comments by Me=
rrill. According to Merrill, recent comments by ORCL's Larry Ellison give c=
ause for concern about SUNW's high-margin Unix server mkt; ORCL is replacin=
g 3 Unix servers with a cluster of INTC servers running Linux; concern is t=
hat SUNW's Unix biz will be attacked from below by INTC servers running NT =
or Linux (particularly Linux, as it's easier to learn than SUNW's Solaris o=
perating system). Microsoft (MSFT) was added to Goldman Sachs portfolio and=
 Oracle (ORCL) was removed.=20
Calpine (CPN) was downgraded to Deutche Bank to BUY from Strong Buy due to =
a lack of near-term catalysts in the stock; current risks include: continue=
d weakness in power prices and spark spreads, the California DWR contract r=
enegotiations, a highly leveraged balance sheet, and a tight cash flow situ=
ation. Price target is $20. We should get used to reading recommendations l=
ike this one. The list of risks is large and imposing and yet many of you w=
ill notice that the target is $20 suggesting a 72% return is possible over =
the next 12 months. We would encourage investors to focus on the risks and =
the likelihood of them happening rather than a highly subjective target.
In Canada, focus on Focus List names Sun Life (SLC) and Shaw Communications=
 (SJR.b). Suitability is everything, never more so than in the current mark=
et environment.
Interest Rate Update=20
The big, but not so surprising news yesterday was the decision by the FOMC =
to keep the Fed funds rate steady at 1.75%, while the discount rate remaine=
d at 1.25%.  also as expected, the Fed maintained their easing bias.  This =
was the first "no change" following an FOMC meeting since Dec/00, after 4.7=
5%  of cuts in 11 steps through 2001.  The committee noted that there are "=
signs that weakness in demand is abating and economic activity is beginning=
 to firm have become more prevalent".  This is different from the last comm=
ent on Dec 11 when they stated "weakness in demand shows signs of abating, =
but those signs are preliminary and tentative".  The easing bias was justif=
ied due to the uncertainty of the strength in business capital and consumer=
 spending.  RBC CM Economics believe that this statement will be a sign of =
things to come, with rates in a holding pattern, and an easing bias remaini=
ng, until the recovery is firmly and sustainably in place.  They are callin=
g for the first hike to occur no earlier than September. - Fed funds future=
s are pricing in earlier expectations - the July contract is indicating a 1=
00% chance of a 25 bps hike.
Stocks are the bigger news with Nasdaq stock futures up 10.50 pts after an =
upgrade to Intel by Merrill Lynch, gains in Oracle after the company reaffi=
rmed its profit target, and Applied Materials stating that a bottom has com=
e and gone for the industry.=20
Have a good weekend and be good,=20

Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list. Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of. 
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

On Monday, we will update access to the website with the names of people who have signed with UBS.  Jeanie Slone is going to forward the latest copy of the list to us on Monday morning, and we will update the security profile at that time.  I will let you know if the schedule changes.

Please note that Wall 2 Wall has been delayed and will be in tomorrow instead of today.  

Sorry for any inconvenience. 

Carla 

With the recent shuffle of people moving to new desks, I'm sure there will be keyboard trays that need to be moved, as well as some repairs.  Wall 2 Wall will be in on Wednesday afternoon to look after this.  

Please let me know by Wednesday morning if you need anything done. 

Thanks, 

Carla

It looks like 713-584 are the new prefix's, but they are as follows:

713-584-1091
713-584-1093
713-584-1050
713-584-1092

I've not been in that room, so I would guess that the first number would be sufficient.

Enron boss cancels testimony 
Cites 'disturbing' TV talk: Blames 'prosecutorial' tone, claims of security fraud
Jason Chow 
National Post 
Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay said yesterday he would not testify at today's scheduled congressional hearing into the company's collapse, blaming legislators' "prosecutorial" comments on TV talk shows yesterday.
"Not only were there corrupt practices, we are finding what may clearly end up being security fraud," Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told NBC's Meet the Press.
An internal company report released Saturday criticized Mr. Lay, other executives, board members and auditors for the collapse.
It showed managers took home millions of dollars through complex partnerships, while hiding at least US$1-billion in losses.
Other politicians denounced the company's management before TV cameras yesterday in response to the report.
Last night, Mr. Lay cancelled his testimony.
"In the midst of our preparation, particularly disturbing statements have been made by members of Congress, even today, on the eve of Mr. Lay's scheduled appearance," his lawyer, Earl Silbert, said in a letter to lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.
"I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation."
Sen. Byron Dorgan, chairman of another Senate Commerce subcommittee investigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, said on Meet the Press the report "suggests massive problems" and shows "a culture of corruption."
While Mr. Dorgan said it was up to the U.S. Justice Department to decide whether to press criminal charges, he added the report showed "clearly some things have happened here that are going to put some people here in real jeopardy."
The 203-page report, written by a team headed by the dean of the University of Texas Law School, said Mr. Lay "bears significant responsibility" for "flawed decisions" in approving some transactions that hid debt and offset losses.
The report said these transactions did not follow accounting rules and were implemented improperly, resulting in Enron overstating earnings by US$1-billion during a one-year period starting in September, 2000.
"Ken Lay obviously had to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme -- a giant shell game," said Republican Sen. Peter Fitzgerald.
Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, began to unravel in October after it said shareholder equity was reduced by around US$1-billion. The company said it used stock to pay off the debt of some of the complex partnerships it had created to reshuffle assets and hide debt.
With its stock already in a tailspin, the Enron house of cards began to collapse. The October writedown raised questions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similar affiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated earnings back to 1997, lowering them by US$586-million.
The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. Its shares sank below US$1 from more than US$80 a year ago, wiping out over US$60-billion worth of investors' stock including the retirement savings of thousands of Enron employees whose pension plans were tied to the shares.
Mr. Lay's decision to withdraw will undoubtedly raise more questions of his strong political connections to the White House.
Mr. Lay, an old friend of U.S. President George W. Bush, was also a major donor to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign, contributing $326,000 in "soft money" to the Republican Party.
Mr. Bush has been dogged by questions about the six meetings Vice-President Dick Cheney or his staff held with Enron executives last year. Mr. Cheney has refused to release records on those meetings, saying they involved matters of energy policy, prompting an unprecedented lawsuit from the congressional General Accounting Office.
The personal drama of the top level executives involved has created a subplot of its own. Clifford Baxter, a 43-year-old former Enron vice-chairman, committed suicide about two weeks ago.
And Mr. Lay enlisted his wife Linda last week in a bid to garner public support, appearing on a series of teary interviews on NBC's Today Show where she said her husband had "lost everything" even though he received more than US$200-million since 1997 from salary, bonuses and sales of Enron stock.
The Enron report released Saturday singled out other top Enron employees who were involved with affiliated partnerships that enriched themselves by "tens of millions of dollars they should have never received."
The report said former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow pocketed at least US$30-million, and former general manager Michael Kopper took at least US$10-million. The two worked together in forming several partnerships that bought assets off of Enron.
But the existence of these transactions "was merely one aspect of a deeper and more serious problem," the report said.
"Many of the most significant transactions apparently were designed to accomplish favorable financial statement results, not to achieve bona fide economic objectives or to transfer risk," the report said.
"They allowed Enron to conceal from the market very large losses."
The report also implicated Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, for conspiring with the company. Andersen officials involved with Enron are scheduled to testify today.
Though Mr. Lay has no plans to talk before the committees, politicians have said they will rope him into the hearings using whatever means necessary.
"Our committee plans to call him as a witness, and if he refuses, he'll be subpoenaed just like everyone else," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Mr. Tauzin. "They were looking for any excuse to try to wiggle off the hook."

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Strong buys: Enterprise is looking up
There is cautious optimism among enterprise software developers.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

Business could be picking up for enterprise software companies, but only a few analysts
are moving into upgrade territory. The most recent quarterly reports for a handful of
companies showed strong results, but only time will tell.

This week, two enterprise software companies in Multex's Internet index have moved
into the "strong buy" territory among the average recommendations. Those companies are
Mercury Interactive (MERQ) and Siebel Systems (SEBL). So what is making analysts
take notice of these companies?

2. Broadly viewed: What is the value of the digital home?
Comcast is paying approximately $5,830 for each AT&T Broadband household. Is this a fair price?

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Comcast (CMCSA) is in the process of acquiring AT&T's (T) broadband unit and its 12
million cable households for approximately $70 billion. Comcast's investment equates to
approximately $5,830 per AT&T Broadband household.  Is this a fair price?

As has been widely reported, this deal will create the largest cable company in North
America, with 22.3 million subscribers. The current value of the digital home is far less
than what Comcast is currently paying, but the future digital home may hold great
potential.

3. Take a bow: Can eBay give investors an encore?
The company is confident that it can maintain super-fast growth, and analysts agree.

by Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The economic landscape is littered with the carcasses of dot-coms that tried but
failed. Only one firm can say that it consistently delivered on its initial growth
metrics: eBay (EBAY). In 1998, when the online auction company went public, it
was set to bag some $86 million in revenue. Three years later, that figure has
exploded to $749 million, and operating profits have risen thirteen-fold.

With shares of eBay trading at lofty heights, investors are clearly expecting more strong
growth to come. Can eBay deliver? The answer, according to those who analyze the
company, is a resounding "yes."

4. E-commerce insights: E-commerce comes out from under the shadows
Companies used to be reluctant to discuss Internet sales, but are now breaking the silence

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Until recently, many companies were reluctant to discuss e-commerce because
they did not want to share their strategies with competitors. Today, however,
companies announce e-business initiatives to show that they are in tune with the
times and prepared to face tough competition in the future.

By comparing a company's e-commerce activity to that of its competitors, shareholders
may gain insight into how well management has grasped the main issues of e-business,
developed an integrated technology strategy, and executed its vision.

INVESTMENT IDEAS
Enterprise software
Wall Street spots some emerging leaders among enterprise software stocks.

Thomas J. Ryan, equity research columnist

Emboldened by better-than-expected fourth quarter results and some
signs of recovery in Internet technology (IT) spending, Wall Street has
turned more bullish on enterprise software.

The group is coming off a dismal 2001, and most analysts expect
software sales to remain generally sluggish through the first half of 2002.
Even if a turnaround in IT spending doesn't arrive in the second half,
Wall Street is finding some leaders emerging that are bound to prosper
once IT budgets grow fat again.

Title: Iran: Conservatives Fighting Hard Against the Tide
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2952;


***********************************************************************

IRAN'S POLITICAL MAP AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INVESTORS

Reading Iran's political map--always complex--is more so now because of the
contradictory nature of the short-term and long-term trends. The short term
offers tension and setbacks to the pro-reform elements. The long term offers
the potential for genuine change in the Iranian political scene.

*  Political tension is the result of Iran's peculiar and essentially unstable
power structure.

*  Despite the setbacks dealt to the reformist agenda defended by the Iranian
president, the conservatives are fighting against the tide.

*  In the short term the political tensions might delay the signing of some
contracts in the oil and gas sector and postpone foreign investment.

Title: Atlantic Basin Distillate Market Update
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2932;


***********************************************************************

ATLANTIC BASIN DISTILLATE MARGINS PRESSURED BY WEAK DEMAND AND AMPLE STOCKS

In stark contrast to last winter's exceptional strength, spot distillate-to-
crude price differentials in Atlantic Basin markets are likely to stay weak:

Demand is down relative to a year ago, resulting from declining air travel,
mild temperatures in North America, and much lower North American natural gas
prices.

* Inventory levels are comfortable, with primary inventories in the United
States and consumer stocks in Germany particularly high.

* Market psychology is preoccupied with the weak economy and downside risks,
whereas a year ago a psychology of shortage prevailed in energy markets.

Title: Searching for the Bottom
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2929;


***********************************************************************

GAS PRICES CONTINUE DOWNWARD DRIFT--HIGH STORAGE, LOW DEMAND

While warm weather keeps heating loads low, the key driver in natural gas
markets continues to be the looming storage surplus. Weather may provide some
short-lived price spikes in February, but until real evidence of the
anticipated decline in US supply appears, prices will feel continued downward
pressure from record-high storage inventories. The projected February average
price is $2.10 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub.

* March storage inventories will end at record high levels. Ample gas remains
to keep prices low until a rebounding economy and declining supplies can
provide a lift.

* With return to a normal weather, strong industrial loads will boost overall
gas demand slightly over last year's levels.

* Diminishing weather-related support and high western storage inventories will
drive widening discounts to the Henry Hub in the western producing areas, while
weak demand and high storage will limit premiums in the East.

Title: Energy Technology Investing: The Bubble Bursts
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2978;


***********************************************************************

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY INVESTMENT CHALLENGE--EXPECTATIONS MEET NEW REALITIES

Between 1998 and 2001, investors poured some US$4.36 billion into companies
developing distributed energy (DE) technologies. This investment boom and the
subsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic
expectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's
development.

*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market
during the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the
telecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'
confidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the
pace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.

*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long
run the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater
maturity among companies and their backers.

*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies
and drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will
become an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the
future.

Chris, this is a year-end adjustment that will be done for your T4 prior to processing them.  Your final pay stub will stay the same as I cannot go back and re-issue those.

I'm going to use the 18K number we have record of and adjust the balance down.

thanks,

Tricia

Tricia,

Have you looked in to the stock option line item on my pay stub yet? The number on the stub is about 36000 and I think about 18000 is accurate.

Hi Chris!

I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November
regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the holiday
season.

Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the
trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing a
formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed
to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can only
tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New Year!

Best regards,

Title: The Refining Parable: Will Power Generation Take Its Cue from Downstream Oil?

***********************************************************************

LESSONS FROM REFINING FOR THE DEREGULATING US ELECTRIC POWER BUSINESS

The US oil refining and marketing industry has experienced weak returns on
investment since oil price decontrol in 1981. As the electric power industry in
the US deregulates, does it face a similar future?

*  There are important structural similarities between these two capital-
intensive, energy commodity transformation industries.

*  There are also differences, most notably the requirement that electricity
demand be met in real time, whereas inventories play an important role in the
refined product value chain.

*  The electric power industry will follow its own unique path through the
process of deregulation, but there are lessons to be learned from the
experience of downstream oil.

A MESSAGE FROM DOUG SPEERS, MBA 1970, CEO OF EMCO LIMITED AND
CHAIR OF THE IVEY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION BOARD

Dear Chris,

I am writing today to introduce an exciting new initiative from the Advancement Department at the Ivey Business School in conjunction with the Ivey Alumni Association Board that will benefit all members of the Ivey community. It's our new on line service called eZone!!

Collaboration is the hallmark of an Ivey Business School education. eZone offers us the ability to collaborate with members of one of the premier associations of business leaders in the world - the Ivey Alumni Network. A little further below, you will see the address for the website and the username and password that you need to log in.

CONNECT WITH CLASSMATES
My Communities is where we'll be able to have online discussions, share ideas and build relationships with classmates and other members of the Ivey Community. Send a request for a new community to Ivey Advancement today!

BUILD YOUR NETWORK
Turn to My Directory to locate a classmate or other member of the Ivey Alumni Network, or to find out how to contact a member of Ivey Faculty or Staff - for the first time, eZone brings together all members of the Ivey Community: Alumni, Students, Faculty and Staff.

MANAGE YOUR CAREER
Click on My Career to post a resume, to view online job postings targeted to Ivey Alumni, and to link to Global Workplace, a unique service open only to alumni from many of the world's premier business schools. Global Workplace gives you access to a worldwide database of senior executive appointments and automatic notification of relevant opportunities.

READ THE NEWS FROM AN IVEY PERSPECTIVE
On the eZone homepage, take note of Ivey in the News. There you will find links to articles about Ivey Alumni and the School that have appeared in the media, and see which of your classmates has been appointed to a new position.

UPDATE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
Community is not something we can take for granted. With the job market facing such uncertainty, it is very important for Ivey Alumni to be able to contact and network with one another. Take a minute today to update your particulars by clicking on My Information in the upper right hand portion of the screen - and don't forget to check the box beside Publish.

Of course YOU CONTROL what information other members of the Ivey network can view about you, but we'll all benefit from a robust Alumni Directory.

Take a few moments and look at eZone today!!

Navigate to http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/ezone and use your username and password to start to benefit from this excellent site

To Seconds/Leads:
Attached is an update of the Priority Settlements matrix with changes identified in bold.

One of the sheets in the attached excel file is a listing of certain contracts deemed Terminated by ECC.  Counsel is seeking MTM calculations on these Terminated contracts/counteparties as soon as possible.  Accordingly, while on-going settlement discussions should continue, the focus for seconds/analysts should shift to calculating the MTM's (some of which are already underway per the Priority Settlements list) from the Terminated Contracts list.  We are currently seeking input from Counsel as to whether we should shift even more resources to the Terminated Contracts list MTM calculations.  We'll let you know on that.

In any case, I'm going to be collecting MTMs on the Priority Settlements when I do my daily rounds - I've been getting this from most of you but there's been some exceptions, so if you have the models done I'll be asking for:
- Your calculated MTM number
- The TAGG / NPower MTM number
Thanks in advance.

Any questions or problems, let me know.

Regards,
Mike

Hi Chris,

No word on your refund.  Tamara is going to follow up again with the IRS in
the next couple of weeks.  Meanwhile, if it appears, please let us know.

Hi Laura,

Chris and I are working on the Zargon termination calculations, and we need to know what we owe them or what they owe us as of today? I think we owe them money for some Crude Oil put options we sold them, but need just wanted to confirm.

Thanks,
Ryan

I have updated the list to reflect all changes received. If you notice any more errors or if any counterparties have been reassigned, please let me know so that I can continue to make changes.
Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers.
Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right.
Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms. 

Please call me at 5-3614 if you have any questions or come by my desk at 06541.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Without Prejudice

Here is the matrix with work allocated.  If you run out of work or have too much, let me know.  Thanks.

Any other issues let me know.

Please follow the procedures laid out in Kyle's memo.

Please set up a file (use a legal file with sections for the model calc's, termination status notes and letters, notes on telephone conversations and script reviewed, release and other agreements, etc. for each counterparty with all of the relevant data.  At the end of the day these will be merged with the legal files.  Use orange labels so that we can easily identify these files around the office.

We now have a directory set up under i:\CES\Estate to capture clean-up stuff.  You should save your models or anything else created in a sub-directory of the company name.

To get a sense of exposures and contract type for a given counterparty, please see Jason Biever.  We have an exposures report prepared out of TAGG with AR/AP from accounting - I don't want this to be widely copied so if you wouldn't mind, just work through Jason to get the 4 pieces of information for your counterparty (physical contract type, FMTM, PMTM, AR, AP).  The MTM is from Dec 11, somewhat in the middle of all the termination dates.  You will have to ask Risk to get a TAGG run from the termination date.
 
Kyle,
We need to confirm a process for handling counterparties with many deals (eg. Duke, PanCdn).  I would suggest that we run TAGG, then take all deals of MTM over $50,000 and model them separately.  The rest of the small deals we would group using the TAGG run to value.  You might want to set a higher or lower threshold.  Please let me know.

Peter,
We need to issue to the teams a termination status for each of the counterparties on the priority list, or would you prefer that groups contact Chris Christopher in Greg's absence to go through the details on termination status (this could prove a roadblock over the next few days).  At any rate, per our process, the teams need to sit down with legal before they start, to understand the situation.

Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it' 
The rise and fall of Houston decadence
Philip Delves Broughton 
The Daily Telegraph, with files from news services 
HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.
"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, money, all of it."
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. version of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention morality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well as laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank," with semi-annual reviews in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers were fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added. Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches were the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
"Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We are fighting for liquidity."

Title: India-Pakistan War? Risks and Implications
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2923;


***********************************************************************

INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR? RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS

Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war could occur between India and
Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is not inevitable; diplomacy could
still pull the two parties back.

*  Such a war--if it does occur--need not prompt doomsday predictions or
excessive global concern so long as both countries see short-term political
advantages accruing from a tightly contained conflict.

*  It would have a complicating but manageable impact on the American-led
counterterrorism effort in south and central Asia.

*  A very limited-duration conflict could even lead to intensive multilateral
efforts to solve the Kashmir dispute, the central dispute between India and
Pakistan.

Ryan and Chris, the last payments we made to Zargon were on January 9, 2002.  These were for January gas options VH6370.1 and .2 in Canadian dollars and for December oil swap QD2986.1 in US dollars.  We have not been able to invoice the oil swap for January as we will not have NXAVCPROMPT until early Feb.  Call me if you need more info.

Hi Laura,

Chris and I are working on the Zargon termination calculations, and we need to know what we owe them or what they owe us as of today? I think we owe them money for some Crude Oil put options we sold them, but need just wanted to confirm.

Thanks,
Ryan

Hi Chris,

As promised, I have phoned the IRS today and spoken with a representative
who was able to tell me that the original request for the trace on your
cheque on September 19 was rejected by their system on October 22.  He told
me that he couldn't tell me why because the IRS aren't sure either why the
system rejected it.  As such, a new request for a trace was placed on
October 22 and now the IRS are asking us to wait until December 17.  The
IRS told me that you should receive a letter called a 510C letter from
them.  I have changed your address with the IRS from Texas to Calgary.  I
would ask that when you receive this letter to fax a copy to my attention
at 781-1825 for our files.

I know that this probably isn't the news you were hoping to hear, but at
least it's some news.  I have made a note to follow up with the IRS again
on December 17 and hopefully by then they will have good news in time for
the holidays!

Again, don't hesitate to contact either Judy or myself should you hear
anything further from the IRS, receive your cheque(!) or have any other
questions or concerns.

Kind regards,

Tamara L. Utsch

Title: Hydro and Gas Storage Dampen Western Winter Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2908;


***********************************************************************

CONTINUED WESTERN MARKET SOFTNESS
High gas storage levels and western power storage in the form of growing
hydroelectric reserves will dampen prices for both commodities through
the winter and potentially deep into next year. Milder weather, retail
electricity price increases, economy-related demand reductions, improved
western hydroelectric conditions, generating capacity additions, and a natural
gas price decline will keep winter markets soft. Henry Hub prices have held
relatively strong in the face of extremely bearish fundamentals. Over the
next month, gas storage inventories will eventually weigh down prices, as that
near-term impact overshadows long-term concerns about declining US production
and weakening rig counts.

* Compared to first quarter 2001, power fundamentals in first quarter 2002 will
be characterized by 30 percent higher hydroelectric output and 8 percent lower
electricity demand.

* Western gas storage inventories remain very strong and increasing supply in
the Rockies and exports from western Canada will lower Rockies and San Juan gas
prices.

* Poor winter 2000/2001 precipitation left the Pacific Northwest vulnerable to
tight power supplies at the start of this winter, recent storms have eliminated
reliability concerns.

Hi Chris,

I will have Tamara Utsch reply to you on your refund - I believe she
updated you last week, but we'll see if there's new news this week.

Can you please send me your current home address so we can send you an
organizer?

Thanks,

   Hi Chris,

   We would be happy to prepare your 2001 returns.   My understanding is
   that
   you moved back from Texas to Canada in 2001, so you will require both a
   US
   return and a part year Canadian return.

   Our fee for this service is $2,600 Cdn. funds + GST.

   Please provide your current address, home phone number, etc. so we can
   add
   you to our list and send you an organizer.

   Kind regards,

   Tamara,

   Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns.
   As
   I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to
   have
   my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian
   returns for 2001. Please advise.

      Hi Chris!

      I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in
   November
      regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the
   holiday
      season.

      Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three
   times
      the
      trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing
   a
      formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
      admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are
      supposed
      to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can
      only
      tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

      In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New
      Year!

      Best regards,

      Tamara L. Utsch
