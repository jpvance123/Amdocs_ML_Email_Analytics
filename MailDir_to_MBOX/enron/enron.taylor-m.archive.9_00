Mark,

 So the sailing debate continues.  I got your email
to my mom that New Year's Eve is a possibility.   That is
definitely the time that Bill will be most likely to be able
to come along.  As he told you he is in "vacation deficit"
until the first of the year.  Then I think that the way the
government works it that you get allotted something like
two vacation days every month.   You can take an advance,
but then you are back in "deficit" until you work it off.
In any case, next year is definitely best for Bill.   As
for the original Thanksgiving plan, that will obviously not
work for me b/c I do not want to leave Bill and he does not
get the Friday after Thanksgiving off so there is no way we
can make it down to the Caribbean and back.  Sorry.

 However, as Bill also pointed out I am a third year
law student and I have a tendency to go on vacation
whenever I can, so although Bill cannot join us I may be
able to go at other times this year if the three of us can
coordinate.  I obviously cannot go during exams (early
December) and I have two seminars a week that I really need
to try to attend, but as long as I try to work around those
I am free.   I have two fall breaks this year one in
October and one in November so those are the best weekends
for me obviously b/c I have fewer classes to worry about
missing (October 12th -15th & November 3rd -8th).

 It seems like it is best for you if we get the boat
for a whole week from Sunday to Sunday - right?  If so, I
can certainly go for part of the week like Wed - Sunday.  Do
you think you would be able to pick me up in some port in
the middle of a week?  If not, do not worry about me.  I
will miss you and I will be sad, but I DID just get back
from Tahiti, so I will get over it and Bill and I will
look forward to joining you next year.

 If you can wait until the new year.  I am off
for Christmas Break well into the new year (I go back
after Martin Luther King day).   Also, next semester I do
not have any seminars lined up so I will be able to take off
for a whole week more easily.

 Those are my thoughts.  I am sorry that my
contribution to dates and the sailing plan took so long,
but I would really love to go if we can find the
time.  Let me know what you decide.

Thanks,
Amanda

Mark;

I've been working with Brazilian local outside counsel on this EOL matter and 
just had a meeting with Remi, David and Ricardo this morning.  For the 
purpose of finalizing the legal support (especially the review and 
"tropicalization" of the EOL agreements), I have a few questions for you:

What entity owns the EOL site ?
Will there be an agreement entered into between the entity that owns the EOL 
site and Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. (and its designated 
branches) for the purpose of authorizing Enron Comercializadora de Energia 
Ltda. to use the EOL tool in Brazil ?
For the purposes of doing business through the EOL tool, would Enron South 
America (and its designated affiliates) or ECE have to enter into the PA and 
the ETA with the entity that owns the EOL site ?

Please note that I have only referred to ECE because I am working under the 
assumption that, at this point in time, we will only do power deals in 
Brazil.  In view of this and for regulatory reasons, the entity buying and 
selling power in Brazil must be ECE (the Enron entity authorized by MAE).

Thanks and Regards,

Sami

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL 
team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had 
heard back from outside counsel.

Julia/Alan/Mark -

Mark asked me to work on a broad outline of a technology plan for the ENA 
Legal Department.  Attached is a draft of the basic outline for the plan and 
the technology alternatives to be considered.  I have based this outline on 
specific areas Mark and I discussed, but it is by no means intended to be 
limited to these areas.  Mark does see the importance of a  deal 
collaboration/e-signature technology and asked that this be the first item 
reviewed for implementation.

At your convenience, please let me know your thoughts and suggestions 
concerning the attached.  If there area any other areas the plan should 
cover, please let me know.

Thanks.

Mark, can you have a look at the proposed changes suggested by Powerex below 
to our Canadian form of financial trading GTC and contact Bill Greenizan of 
the Calgary office to let him know whether the proposed changes are 
acceptable or not?  I think they have done the swap already and need to paper 
it.

Thanks

Greg,

Prior to doing the one-year trade with Powerex I forwarded the traders over 
there a copy of our GTC (identical to the Duke contract).

The traders got the following feedback from their legal / contracts people. 
Their main concern is the language in section VII.

Let me know if you have any comments and what changes (if any) we should make 
when we send Powerex the confirmation for the Cal 2001 contract.

Thanks

I am concerned about the status of the Power and Gas GTCs. 

I am pushing the marketing group to sign up customers in advance of launch 
but we still have not finalized an agreement. This is of the utmost 
importance otherwise turning EOL on will be like listening to yourself 
talk.   

Please advise of the status of these documents and when I can review them.

Dear Mark and Mark!
I spoke to Jeanette Elbertson last week and she suggested that I send you 
both a brief outline giving some background which I have pleasure in doing.
My Chairman John Wisbey who founded the company in 1989 is next in New York 
in October 11/12/13 but I am unsure as to where we would possibly meet if you 
deemed it worthwhile?
As his Vice Chairman I am working out of our New York office for 6 months 
generally in an effort to raise our group profile and as active associate 
members of ISDA Rick Grove and his team have suggested that I meet as many of 
the Board members as possible during my time.

Mark,

I recently moved back to ENA as director of trading accounting which includes 
accounting for all of our futures activity.  We are getting a lot of 
inquiries as to how Enron can save money regarding this activity.  One area 
that was mentioned was Enron becoming a clearing member.  I was told this 
route had been pursued in the past and dropped.  Your name was provided as 
the Enron legal rep who worked this.  If possible, could you please provide 
me with the reasons this avenue was not considered a good fit for Enron.  I 
would like to have the correct facts to present when this comes up again in 
my discussions.

Thanks for the assisstance.

Anna,

I have reviewed the existing ECTRIC, Norweigan Branch HDD Swap GTC's.  In 
contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on 
the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed,  the 
HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework.  
The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each 
transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Master Agreement.   As 
such every counterparty should be required to accept the GTC's regardless of 
whether or not they have an ISDA Master Agreement in place.  If an ISDA 
Master has been executed this will govern the HDD Swaps as modified by the 
terms of the relevant GTC's.  If no ISDA Master is in place the GTC's will 
govern.

I have made some drafting changes in respect of the existing HDD Swap GTC's 
which I have forwarded to Mark and Justin for comments.  I will revert to you 
in due course with respect to any changes. 

Best regards,

Denis

Subject: GTC's for weather

Justin/Denis

When we recently launched Swedish, UK, Norwegian and French weather HDD swaps 
on EOL, there were three counterparties that were indicated as having ECTRIC 
masters in place that would apply when trading  weather HDD swaps.  Dave 
Forster's email below indicates that these masters should not be used for 
weather transactions and that we should use either the GTC or a 
weather-specific Master Agreement. 

The counterparties that legal initially indicated as having masters in place 
for weather transactions are as follows:

Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc - ECTRIC master in place no. 96023172
J.Aron & Company - ECTRIC master in place no. 96033708
The Chase Manhatten Bank - ECTRIC master in place no. 96040163

Please could you confirm (as Dave states below) that these master agreements 
should not apply for trading weather HDD swaps and that the above mentioned 
counterparties should really have a weather-specific master in place or be 
asked to accept the applicable GTCs online.

For your information I have attached the original counterparty profile list 
reviewed by Edmund.  The master agreement numbers that are crossed out are 
those masters that were applicable when the legal entity for HDD Swaps was 
ENA. The legal entity is now ECTRIC, Norwegian Branch.

Please could you advise me as soon as possible.

Thanks

Anna

Subject: GTC's for weather

It has come to my attention that when we have a Financial Master Agreement in 
place, we have identified that a Master exists for the Weather Products.

This is not correct as the ISDA Masters do not properly cover weather. For 
Weather transactions, we need to use either the GTC or a weather-specific 
Master Agreement.

Frank: Could you please arrange to identify which companies have already 
transacted on weather and have done so ostensibly under an ISDA?  Could you 
please also coordinate with Mark as necessary to update Customer Profiles so 
that customers with ISDA's will need to accept GTC's?

If we have customers who have ostensibly transacted already under their 
ISDA's, let's identify who they are and then decide on a course of action for 
their profiles.

Thanks,

Dave

Dear Dale and Brent,

We have checked this morning and these do not seem to have been loaded yet.  
Is there anything else that we need to do from the Tokyo side?

This is very urgent.

Thanks

Jane McBride

The documents can be loaded.  Please note that the style and font of the Tax 
representation section will need to conform to the rest of the document.  
Dale what needs to happen next.  John, I am working on trying to develop a 
policy and language to incorporate into certain of the Password Applications 
that would require the counterparty to specify a process agent in the US.  I 
think this policy would also be applicable as well to any Non-US counterparty 
or Non-Japanese counterparty that would trade under this GTC.  I will keep 
you informed of my progress.

Thanks,
Brent

The changes seem appropriate to me; however, I will defer to Jeff Hodge, my 
fellow Committe member, on giving the Commitee's approval to this set of 
recommended changes due to his involvement in the Blue Range matter.

I hate to sound like a jerk (but its the nature of my job, and perhaps my 
personality, so I will).  Another day has passed and the Bank has yet to see 
paper, and frankly we have yet to see the Bank's paper.  Frankly I am very 
concerned about this getting done on time.  I know this can all be put in 
place, but I think we need to make a concerted and coordinated effort to make 
this our individual priorities between now and Friday.  I will be in a plane 
until mid-afternoon tomorrow, but will be reachable after that by cell @ 
403-819-5528.

In my absence Greg Johnston has kindly agreed to help out.  Greg can be 
reached @ 403-974-6745.

I want to set out below the various tasks and responsibilities as I see them, 
and the outstanding issues as I understand them.  I think a distribution of 
all drafts needs to be circulated by no later than mid-afternoon tomorrow, 
with a view to review of drafts Tuesday, revising drafts Wednesday, 
finalizing drafts and executing Thursday and funding Friday.

A.  SWAP #1 w/ Swapco (Bow River Trust):

*  Credit worksheet - Bill

*  ISDA Master, etc. - Tana/Sara

*  Transaction terms (gas prepay) - Brian/Soma/RBC

*  Confirm (gas prepay) - Sara

*  Blakes opinion re; ECC - Warren

*  Enron Corp. G'ee - Clement

*  J. Derrick opinion re: Enron Corp. - Clement

*  VE opinion re: Enron Corp. - ? (Clement)

*  Macleod Dixon opinion re: Swapco - Warren to follow-up


B.  SWAP #3 w/ RBC

*  Credit worksheet - Bill

*  ISDA Master, etc. - Tana/Sara

*  Transaction terms (gas swap) - Brian/Soma/RBC

*  Confirm (gas swap) - Sara

*  Transaction terms (interest rate swap) - Brian/Soma/RBC

*  Confirm (interest rate swap) - Sara

*  Blakes opinion re; ECC - Warren

*  Enron Corp. G'ee - Clement

*  J. Derrick opinion re: Enron Corp. - Clement

*  VE opinion re: Enron Corp. - ? (Clement)

*  Macleod Dixon opinion re: RBC - Warren to follow-up


C.  OTHER  

*  Fee Letter - Macleod Dixon - Warren to follow-up  

*  Indemnification re: Increased Costs - Macleod Dixon - Warren to follow-up

*  Promissory Note from ECPC to ECC - Greg

*  Resolution re: Promissory Note for ECC - Greg

*  Resolution re: Promissory Note for ECPC - Greg


D.  ISSUES

*  Generic cross-default to any ECC swap in ECC portfolio over specified 
threshold amount - as discussed, I would consider this as unacceptable but 
will defer to commercial.  The scope of the default would be overly broad, 
the Bank is relying on Enron Corp. credit and will have a third party debt 
x-default to Enron Corp. of US$100MM.  If agreed, this needs to be considered 
for both Swap #1 and  #3

*   Cross-default to Enron Corp. Credit Agreement - as discussed, this should 
be unnecessary if Credit Agreement reps/wars/covenants are in the Enron Corp. 
G'ee, but this could be a solution to providing a short for Enron Corp. G'ee

*  Cross-default to Swapco Credit Agreement with BF Equity for illegality - 
as discussed, since ECC is not a party to that transaction and would have no 
standing to take any position to prevent acceleration, since ECC would 
nonetheless be obligated on Swap #1, the Bank's only issue would be timing of 
repayment, the risk is more theoretical than real for the Bank and given that 
the loan is part of the Bank's own off-balance sheet structure, this should 
not be acceptable.  If agreed, this needs to be considered for both Swap #1 
and  #3

*  Syndication - the Bank will be entitled to syndicate up to 50% of the 
amount funded under Swap #1 to Canadian Chartered Banks, but not more than 
20% of the funded amount to Schedule II Canadian Chartered Banks.  Increased 
cost of funding by Schedule II Banks will be accounted for under the interest 
rate swap.  The issue will be to define the parameters of our participation 
in syndication, to whom we have recourse under Swap #3 (and #1) and to 
document the right to syndicate Swap #1 separately from the adjustment to the 
interest rate swap.

Finally, we need some answers on my earlier e-mail, including as to wiring of 
funds and amount required to be funded.

Mark, Tana asked me to send you an e-mail re-summarizing the d/b/a issue.

According to Illinois counsel, there is no quirk in Illinois law that 
mitigates against being able to enforce a contract with a party who signs the 
contract under a registered d/b/a name.   Since we have a copy of the 
company's d/b/a filing certified by the Illinois Secretary of State, we 
should already have everything we need.   In an abundance of caution, we 
could ask the counterparty's corporate secretary to certify that "[actual 
corporate name]" and "[d/b/a name]" are one and the same entity.  But I 
personally think even doing that is overkill -- the Illinois Secretary of 
State is already basically telling us that in the certificate we already have 
in the file.

Feel free to call w/ any comments or questions.

If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in 
the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is 
obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his.

These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers.  
We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London 
first week in October so we do need them by then,

If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs 
them for that week.

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Today's newspaper in Korea reported that a seminar on weather insurance and

officers of insurance companies as well as futures companies emphasized the 
need for weather insurance and weather derivatives.  I thought you might be 
interested.  Regards,

Dear Ms Hong

Thank you for your memo dated 12 July 2000 on EnronOnline and our various
telephone discussions on the matter.

I had previously enquired on the consequences of not obtaining the relevant
approvals or filing the relevant report with the Bank of Korea. You advised in
your memo thatthe Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments
under the transaction and that the Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that 
foreign
exchange authorization must be obtained before a judgment can be executed
against a Korean party and the proceeds remitted.

Your advice was certainly pertinent to our assumption that transacting Enron
affiliates would all be off shore to Korea, kindly clarify whether the 
inability
to remit foreign exchange is the only consequence. Accordingly, what would be
the consequences of not filing a report or obtaining approval from BOK where 
the
two contracting parties are on shore Korean entities?

I tried to call you today, but understand you are on vacation until 28 August
2000. I would be most grateful if you could answer the above question when you
return.

Many thanks
Matt

Mark Taylor and I reviewed the subject agreement and have some general 
comments.

Given the agreement is between EBS and the outside counterparties we would 
like to eliminate any mention of EnronOnline (the only place were we feel it 
may be necessary is in the failover article IV).   EBS has the EIN which can 
be used as an alternative to the Internet and the customer has agreed to use 
such alternative.
The term can be month to month with thirty days written notice by either 
party.  No need to mention EnronOnline or the pilot program. 
Can we make this agreement much more customer friendly?  This appears to be 
an agreement that you use with customers who are being guranteed a certain 
level of service (as evidenced by the reference to ePowered Content in 
Article XIII).  We would like to keep the agreement focused on access to 
facility, letter of authorization and the interconnect order if possible.   I 
understand that you are commiting to EnronOnline a certain level of service 
which is predicated upon your ability to get assurances from our customers 
however we should deal with that in our agreement if necessary.
What is the extent of the equiptment that we will be housing at the 
facilities?  If it is limited this would give us another opportunity to 
reduce the scope of the contract.

Lets discuss tomorrow and see if we can get this wrapped up.  Lorraine will 
schedule.  Thanks

Pursuant to our previous discussions, I am attaching a copy of the Legal 
Contact list for use by Enron Metals employees in the US, Canada, and South 
America. Also, as we discussed, since Houston is not yet linked to the 
MG/Enron Metals e-mail address book, please circulate via e-mail for me the 
Legal Contact list to each of the Enron Metals employees in NY, Chicago, St. 
Louis, Montreal, and South America (Lima and Santiago).  Thanks.

If anyone has any questions, they are free to call me at 713-853-3214.

		 Subject: Single Master Agreement


As we discussed at the Board meeting last week, the impetus for a single
master agreement will need to come from several fronts, but especially from
within each of your firms. The various trade associations will be most
responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single
agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will
separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that
sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial
products that would be covered by such an agreement.

The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this
project are the following:

Securities Industry Association (US)
The Bond Market Association (US)
International Securities Market Association (principally Europe)
European Banking Federation (Europe)
The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo)
Emerging Markets Traders Association

The following associations may also be helpful to the process:

Australian Financial Markets Association
British Bankers Association
Japan Securities Dealers Association
Canadian Bankers Association
International Primary Markets Association (London-based)
ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_

If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to
discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that
organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for
financial products and urge them to express their support to the
associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my
memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an
edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions
with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible
approaches for ISDA.

I will try to contact each of you over the course of the next week to get
your feedback. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to email me or call me (212-332-2554)

Bob

Justin -

Further to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap 
GTC's.  In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are 
drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been 
executed,  the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the 
ISDA framework.  The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation 
for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form.   I have 
made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the 
carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only 
apply if an ISDA has been executed. 

Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the 
relevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in 
place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make 
any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered 
into subsequent to the execution of a Transaction.   In such circumstances on 
a literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would 
continued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed 
by the ISDA/Master Agreement.  From a netting perspective this is not ideal.  
Is this the intention ?

Give me a shout when you have had a chance to review the attached.

Denis

Marie, Arfan, - 

Please find attached the first draft of the referenced GTC's together with a 
draft of the long form description.  As discussed once you have forwarded to 
the relevant trading desk - I would be grateful if you could set-up a call to 
discuss later this week.

Some of the Points I need feedback on are:

Standard Terms of an American And European option;
Premium Payment Date;
HDD Calculation Period;
Procedure for Exercise;
Exercise Time;
Option Settlement Date;
Will each short description either be a call option or a put option ?
HDD Swap provides for a one off adjustment to the amounts paid if a Reporting 
Servicee publishes a missing temperature within 95 dayus of the end of the 
Claculation Period - should such a provision also be included  ?


Thanks,

Denis

are there any templates you use when rejecting a prospective EOL C/P due to 
insufficient creditworthiness (i.e. fails the CFTC net worth, etc test)?

Thanks.

Subject: Rejection letter for EnronOnline

Hi Justin

I could really do with some help on this!

McTaggart Shipping and Management have applied for access to EOL, however 
Credit have rejected their application 
due to the fact that this counterparty do not pass the CFTC test for 
financial trades. I have spoken to Paul Maley about this
and basically McTaggart don't meet the required financial requirements. 

I have constructed a draft letter to send to the customer, and I have run 
this past Amita, but we're not sure on how we should 
phrase the reason why we are rejecting them. Credit have told us not to be 
too specific. 

Could you possibly help us out with how we should draft this letter?? 

Pierre Aury (trader) has been in contact with this customer and apparently 
they are pretty touchy!!


Thanks 
Caroline

Subject: RE: Revised DealBench Site License Agreement


Nora,

Per my weekend voicemail, we have reviewed your changes to the Site License 
Agreement and Services Agreement, and have only the following minor comments:

Services Agreement

1.  The reference in Section 4 on indemnification in the first sentence, 
second line, should be to "Net Works", not "DealBench".

You are correct. 

Please note that regarding Section 1, counsel to Net Works has requested more 
specificity of Net Works' duties regarding identification of potential 
bidders  1(a)(i) and bid analysis 1(b)(iii). Accordingly, after consulting 
with the business team, I suggest the following:

For 1(a)(i): assist the Seneca Entities in contacting potential bidders 
identified by the Seneca Entities and if Net Works elects to identify 
potential    bidders, those identified by Net Works;

For 1(b)(iii):  assist the Seneca Entities in analyzing bids for Portfolios 
received on or before September 8, 2000 by reporting bid information in an    
organized manner, such as preparing a factual comparison of bid information; 
and

add new 1(b)(iv): assist the Seneca Entities in responding to bid offers for 
the Portfolios received on or before September 8, 2000.


Site License

1.  Date:  The Services Agreement is dated July 1, and the Site License July 
17.  Is this difference intentional?  The date is not so important except for 
the fact that there are cross-references between the agreements, and 
technically speaking, if they are dated on different dates, then references 
in the earlier agreement (as in the recitals) may cause unintentional busts.

It is my understanding that the Pre-Solicitation Period began before the 
effectiveness of the Site License Agreement.  Subject to confirmation from 
the DealBench team, I do not believe having both Agreements dated as of July 
1, 2000 is a problem.

2. Seneca Address For Notice:  c/o EN-BT Delaware, Inc., 51 W. 52nd St, New 
York, NY 10019, Attn:  Brian J. McGuire.

Change will be made.

3.  Exhibit C, Section 1.  We accept the revised payment structure, but would 
prefer that the $900,000 payment be due on October 2, 2000, rather than the 
"earlier of" construct now included.

Ok.

4.  Exhibit C, Section 3.  Please explain the added language "except for 
video-related costs and expenses", which could be read to mean that either 
such services will not be invoiced (though they are outside the scope of 
services), or that they are expressly within the scope of services.  In any 
event, and to prevent any future confusion on what are/are not extraordinary 
expenses, we would like a proviso to this section that Deal Bench will not 
incur any extraordinary expenses without Seneca's
prior written consent, in Seneca's sole discretion.  If DealBench believes a 
service is necessary, but Seneca doesn't want to pay, then it is Seneca's 
loss, and Deal Bench has satisfied its duties by raising the subject.

The DealBench team advises that although up and downloading of videos are 
included in the Services, video-related costs and expenses will be extra.

Well, that's all.  I think that since the site license is in your system, it 
would be sensible for you to prepare the execution copy.  Likewise, I will 
prepare the execution copy of the services agreement.  Please let me know 
what you think.

This approach makes sense.  Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Scott Kimpel

Justin,

Thank you.

I have your questions. I will get back to you ASAP.

All the best,

Ned

>>> <Justin.Boyd@enron.com> 09/25/00 06:03pm >>>
Ken, Ned,

Thank you both for your written advice concerning the marketing of LME
registered contracts   I would be grateful if you could both answer the
following additional questions:

1.  Can Enron Metals Ltd market LME Contracts to the 40 or so existing US
customers of MG London Inc.(as well as, of course, new US customers)?

2.  So far as marketing by Enron Metals Ltd is concerned, do all written
marketing materials (e.g letters, faxes, brochures, fliers and mailshots)
need explicitly to be sent in the name of Enron Metals Ltd?  Alternatively,
is it possible for such materials to be sent under the cover of EnronOnline
but with a footer appearing on such materials referring to Enron Metals Ltd
(e.g."Enron Metals Ltd is SFA registered")?

3.  In the context again of marketing by Enron Metals Ltd. - and I have
assumed your answer will be in the negative - would any group relief be
available, given that Enron Metals Ltd is part of the Enron group of
companies of which EnronOnline forms part?

4.  Although I am sure you have already confirmed this, can you once again
confirm that Enron Metals Ltd is free to market LME contracts to new US,
whether MG London Inc. do so as well?

5.  In terms of marketing activities conducted by telephone or fax with US
customers, I assume that this may only be carried out only by employees of
Enron Metals Ltd or MG London Inc. (as applicable)?

Thanks.
Justin

Subject: Enron Online Game advice


PLease see below for the consolidated gaming advice from the various
European jurisdictions:

1 List of countries where employees of Enron's customers can play the
game and be awarded prizes ("approved countries"):
 UK (because the participants do not pay to enter, the game is not in
public, and the game is not promoting Enron's business);
 Germany (because the participants do not pay to enter, and provided
the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a
marketing tool);
 Austria (because the participants do not pay to enter, and provided
the game is only advertised to existing customers and is not used as a
marketing tool);
 Switzerland (because the participants do not need to pay to enter);
 Finland (because the participants do not need to pay to participate,
the game is not used as a promotional tool and Enron as a foreign organiser
do not have tax liabilities to the Finnish government);
 Portugal (because participants do not pay to enter and the game is
run outside Portugal);
 Poland (because participants do not pay to enter and the game is not
used as a promotional tool, and assuming that Enron have objective means of
determining who can and cannot become an online customer).  The Polish
lawyers would like me to confirm this latter point to them - I await this
confirmation (requested from Mark Taylor).
2 List of countries where there are risks involved if Enron's
customers can play the game and be awarded prizes:
 Belgium
 It is unclear whether the game is a lottery (these require special
authorisation in order not to be unlawful) or a contest (usually allowable)
under Belgium law.  The game has been submitted to the Belgium regulators
(who decide this classification) but a response has not yet been received.
There seems quite a low risk that the game would be classified as a lottery
because an element of skill is involved, but there is still a risk that the
authorities would be of the opinion that the element of skill was not
adequate to "move" the game from a lottery classification to a contest
classification.  It does not matter that there is no charge - the scheme
could still be classified as a lottery.
 Organising an unauthorised lotteries may give rise to criminal,
civil and administrative sanctions, including imprisonment from 8 days to 3
months and a fine of BEF 10,000 to BEF 600,000 (approximately EU 250 to EU
15,000).
 Netherlands
 Under the Dutch Games of Chance, games of chance are generally
prohibited, even if participation is free.  It is not clear whether or not
the Dutch Games of Chance Act applies to internet games or whether the Dutch
authorities would consider that they had jurisdiction over the game, because
the server is based in the US and the site is in English.  Contravention of
the Dutch Games of Chance Act can have criminal sanctions - maximum fine of
NLG 25,000.
 Norway
 The outstanding issue (providing the game is not a promotional tool)
is tax.  If a Norwegian resident wins a prize, Enron would need to pay
social security contributions of 14.1% (plus an extra 12.5% if the employee
concerned earns more than NOK 750,000).  Enron will be responsible for
reporting the prize to the tax authorities and to withold the tax from the
payment to the winner.
 Sweden
 It is possible that the game could be considered a lottery in Sweden
- it doesn't matter that there is no fee to enter, all that is needed is for
the public to be offered the chance to win prizes based on chance.
Authorisation to run a lottery is virtually never given unless the lottery
is for a charitable purpose.
 The Swedish lottery board consider that the target number in
deciding whether a lottery is public or not is 250.  However, the courts are
apparantly not bound to accept this figure, and case law suggests that it is
the relationship between the participants that is key - games that have not
been found to be lotteries are those organised amongst a private
circle/"apparent community" i.e. a fan club.  Our Swedish lawyers believe
that there is at least a chance that being employees of [presumably various]
Swedish customers of Enron would not constitute an "apparent community" in
the opinion of the court.  Arranging an unlawful lottery can be considered a
criminal offence, punishable by a fine or a maximum of 6 months
imprisonment.
 Denmark
 On line competitions are subject to the Danish Marketing Practices
Act and effectively require authorisation from the Danish Consumer Ombudsman
to ensure that they meet the standard of "good marketing practice".  Our
Danish lawyers have contacted the Ombudsman, but have not yet received a
response.
 Italy
 The game is more than likely an advertising contest under Italian
law and therefore needs approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance.
Approval has not yet been requested (because I do not have the complete name
and address of any of the Italian subsidiaries of Enron who the application
would need to be made on behalf of).  It is uncertain that the Italian
authorities would consider themselves to have jurisdiction over the game
because the server is in the US and the site is in English.  We are also
advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not routinely undertake
regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify potentially
unlawful advertising contests.  There is a fine of approx. 7,500 USD for
failure to obtain authorisation, and continuing an unauthorised game can
result in a fine of up to 50,000 USD.
 Spain
 The preliminary opinion of our Spanish lawyers was that the game may
raise issues under consumer protection law in Spain. I have not yet received
a more substantive opinion from them.
 France
 The game more than likely contravenes French lottery law because
spending additional time on the internet can constitute a charge (this has
been confirmed by the appropriate authority).  There was a possibility that
the game could run if ISP costs were reimbursed to the participants, but
Leslie Hansen has already indicated to me that this is not feasible.


3 List of countries where employees of Enron's customers can play the
game provided they are excluded from being awarded a prizes.
 Belgium (please note the comments given in the context of the Euro
2000 game that there is an evidential risk that "internet disclaimers" may
not be effective because they do not constitute  written proof of the terms
of a contract).
 Netherlands
 Norway
 Sweden
 Italy
 I have still not received conclusive advice as to whether it is just
residents of these jurisdictions that need to be excluded from winning
prizes or whether anyone playing the game from terminals in these
jurisdictions who isn't necessarily resident in that country (for example,
whilst they are at work at the site of an Enron customer) needs to be
excluded as well.  For safety, I would suggest that it is a condition of the
game that participants who reside in a country where prizes can be awarded
are told that they need to access the game only from that jurisdiction, (or
from another of the "approved jurisdictions").  It should be made clear that
participants forfeit their right to a prize if they do not abide by this
rule.
 In all these countries, the fact that residents etc of these
countries cannot be awarded prizes should be stated clearly and specifically
in the rules so as to avoid accusations that Enron is misleading
participants into believing that they can win a prize.
4 List of countries where there are doubts that even excluding
residents of that country from winning prizes would make the game lawful
 Spain - we have not received advice on this point
 Denmark - because it is consumer legislation, and not lotteries
legislation, that is at issue, preventing participants from winning prizes
may well not be enough to avoid liability under Danish law.
 France - our French lawyers were particularly concerned about how
people could be prevented from playing the game from France - and I have not
yet heard back from them that the measures I set out in paragraph 3 above
satisfy their concerns.
 In these countries, we have been advised that a disclaimer stating
that residents of that country are ineligible to play the game, coupled with
a registration process preventing residents of those countries from
participating, should be enough to prevent Enron from being liable for
breach of the relevant laws.
5 Miscellaneous issues
 Germany - if employees of Enron are allowed to play the game in
Germany (regardless of whether or not they are able to win prizes) then the
works council of Enron's German subsidiary will need to be informed about
the intended game and will need expressly to grant their consent.

The commercial folks here are anxiously awaiting the final approval of the

have our documentation in order.  

 Please respond as soon as possible.

Clement-

I am temporarily based in Tokyo and have been working with Mark Taylor to put 
together our ISDA related documentation for use in Japan with Japanese 
counterparties.  

With regard to the Enron Corp. guaranty, it is believed that utilizing New 
York law, as opposed to Texas law, may be more palatable (based on local 
market practice) for the Japanese counterparties.  Therefore, I would like to 
obtain your view in doing so.  Attached hereto, is a draft of the guaranty 
for your reference (this particular draft has been prepared for The Mitsui 
Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Limited).

Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on 
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?  
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving - 
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).  
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set in 
stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.  I 
understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of course 
that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I did hear 
from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.   And I am 
still looking for something to do over Christmas.

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's reply.
I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which
were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and 
was
beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.  Have
you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me
that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone 
for
the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to
his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans 
soon
- that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd
rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.

Mark,

Can one of the paralegals in your group resume sending out the executed list 
of masters on a monthly basis?  I think Susan Flynn had been doing this in 
the past.  Considering the rapid pace at which we are executing documents, it 
would be very helpful for us if we could resume distribution.  Thanks!

Ned, Ken

Thanks very much for your responses to my recent questions. 

In the meantime, I attach draft text below that we intend to publish.  Please 
note that this relates not only to LME registered contracts but also to OTC 
physical metals (straightforward sales/purchases) products.  The expression 
"Enron Metals" is the generic name used to describe the metals business  - 
the underlying contracting entities would be Enron Metals Limited (for LME 
Registered Contracts and for OTC metal swaps and other cash-settled metal 
derivatives) and Enron Metals & Commodity Limited (for physically-settled OTC 
sales and purchases of metal).

My changes are as shown.

Please would you let me know whether you approve or whether you have any 
comments in terms of presentation, content and format.  

In view of printing deadlines, I'd be very grateful if you could respond 
today.

Many Thanks.
Justin

This appears clear to me. We do not hold any risk with the CNV unless we
create it.

Mark do we need any further clarification from your perspective?

The worst would be we are warned, asked to make a change or shut down. I do
not have anything to loose in an emerging market with limited liquidity
already. It would be different if there was an existing business that would
be harmed. This is all incremental value from today.

MFG

Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.

Mark

Thanks for your response on this. I thought that in principle many of the 
hedges we used would be harmless, however, I would feel more comfortable with 
a more detailed review with you, particularly since one of the hedging 
transaction types involves the use of Enron stock.

Let me know when would be a convenient time to brief you.

Regards
David

Justin, Enron Canada is currently in an unresolved dispute with Bank of Nova 
Scotia where from our perspective Bank of Nova Scotia has essentially been 
telling us to shove off.  The dispute involves BNS's purported requirement to 
consent to collateral security given to Enron Canada for physical and 
financial trading positions with a counterparty known as Beau Canada.  
Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should 
be traded OnLine and all trading ought to be monitored until such time as 
this matter is resolved, and this should be expressly communicated to Bank of 
Nova Scotia.  They can speak to me directly at 403.974.6923 or to our 
President and CEO, Rob Milnthorp at 403.974.6714.

I am copying this memo to Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor for their information.

I really need to speak with Mark Taylor about the structure of the shell
corporation before we can go any farther on the Enron Online initiative.  I
realize he is busy.  What is the priority on this to help me get it moved

This topic has moved up on the radar screen over here.  In addition to the
issues about setting up the shell corporation, what are the rules for the
Enron affliliates who trade on line?  Josie Castrejana in our credit group
has talked to Tom Moran in your credit group.  EOTT is concerned about
credit issues for the shell corporation.  How do you handle that with the
other Enron affiliates?  Who would post letters of credit or guaranties?
How does the contract get from the Enron affiliate to EOTT--is the contract
assigned or do we do back to back deals?  If this is a physical
transaction, we need to figure out a way to coordinate names on the
contract, credit, invoice, ticket, etc.  Also, who would nominate the
volumes?

Needless to say, we are not finished yet.  Please let me know when you
would be available to go over these issues.  Thanks so much for your help.

_________________________ 
CORPORATES CONSIDER HEDGING AS OIL PRICES LEAP 
Asian corporates, including Eva Airlines, Fletcher Challenge Energy and 
Bharat Pertroleum Corp. are reconsidering their hedging strategies as oil 
prices hit a new 10-year high last week. Oil producers are looking to lock in 
high 
rates, while oil consumers are considering adjusting the amount of the 
exposure 
they hedge. 

EURO/DOLLAR VOL RISES IN ANTICIPATION OF DANISH VOTE 
Traders are piling into short-date options expiring on Sept. 29, the date 
when the 
results of the Danish referendum to enter the euro-zone will be announced. 
However 
the referendum ends up, the markets are likely to react wildly. 

FIRST CHICAGO EQUITY DERIVATIVES TRADER STEPS DOWN; 
MARKET WONDERS 
The head of equity derivatives trading at First Chicago Tokio Marine has 
stepped down, 
and the bank has been seen unwinding positions in the market. Rival traders

Jonathan, Ned,

Enron Europe Limited would be fine, thanks.

And a couple of other questions, which blend with the ones I mentioned below.

has there been issued any statement by the CFTC or other regulatory body 
regarding the point about marketing via the Internet not infringing 30/10 
relief, i.e without breaching the limited marketing rules?  Can LME Contracts 
therefore be marketed via the EnronOnline website to US customers, bearing in 
mind that the underlying principal to the LME Contract would (so far as 
EnronOnline is concerned) be Enron Metals Limited (formerly known as MGL)?  
As an aside, each Counterparty that is given access to the EnronOnline system 
is required to execute certain "access" documentation - for the US, the Enron 
entity to these documents is EnronOnline LLC, and for Europe, the entity is 
Enron Power Operations Limited.  In each case, EnronOnline LLC and Enron 
Power Operations Limited execute these documents on behalf of themselves as 
well as their group undertakings.  But note that no cases will EnronOnline 
LLC or  Enron Power Operations Limited be the Enron contracting entity to any 
trade concluded via EnronOnline.
is MG London Inc. (the FCM) required to act as agent or as principal under 
the LME Contracts with US customers, or can it merely market to US customers 
and then pass these on to Enron Metals Limited in London for execution, 
whether offlline or via EnronOnline?

Thanks.
Justin

On a house keeping point, is this work for Enron Metals or a different Enron

Dear Jonathan,

Following our conference call yesterday, I hope these action points for you
make sense:-

   Determine the scope of the 30/10 exemption, assuming it was granted to
   MGL in 1988 and confirm the benefit to MGL of changes to CFTC Rules
   since then.

   Determine the scope of the FCM authorisation granted to MG London Inc.

   Provide details of the requirements for the purpose of 30/10 and FCM
   authorisation in terms of customer warnings/documentation required to be
   given.

   Confirm alternative bases for relief under 30/10 and FCM authorisation.

   Confirm that MG London Inc. (as an FCM) may market to US customers
   without also having to act as disclosed agent for EOL.

   Confirm that marketing via the Internet, ie. the EnronOnline website,
   does not infringe any conditions of the 30/10 relief.

Thanks,

Justin Boyd

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

"Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word "not" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations."

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=
ed=20
here at Enron Japan, therefore I have copied her on this correspondence. =
=20
Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon.

Best regards,

Thanks for your input.  I agree with all of the comments you have raised.  =

=09=09 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,
Konishi IBJ Tokyo

I received this from Craig Young yesterday of the MG New York office who 
visited us Sep. 13-15.

If you review the Word document below, he wants me to gather much information 
which
we've been selective in providing to any internal or external party. As you 
know, some of this information is being
provided to Sarah Wesner under the direction of John Arnold and John Lavorato.

Given the current tentative status of MG clearing trades, I am not 
comfortable in providing this data at this time to MG.

However, if you think that we should be of assistance for their own analysis 
to clear/ not to clear trades, please let me know.

Thanks,

Mark, I agree with your analysis, conclusions and amendments.  Well done.  I 
trust the Legal Trading Committee will also agree, but I will be interested 
by their response.

Paul/Alan,

We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
"research" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been "green 
lighted" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:

Germany
France
Italy
Norway
Netherlands
Spain
United Kingdom


Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
countries which include:

Austria
Belgium
Denmark
Ireland
Israel
Sweden
Switzerland
Portugal
Turkey


I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
like to discuss issues associated with this request. 

Thanks and regards,
John

Tana-

I see that ENA is a contemplated counterparty for Japanese weather 
derivatives.  There are both legal and tax issues that require 
consideration.  

I am unsure if Susan Musch has had the opportunity to review the tax issues, 
therefore I have copied her on this note.

With regard to Japanese legal issues, there are certain matters that must be 
dealt with in the GTCs, if entering into transactions between ENA and 
Japanese counterparties are being considered, including issues of an 
underlying legitimate business purpose to avoid gambling restrictions etc.

Please inform me with whom I should be in contact to ensure that these issues 
are appropriately handled.

Thanks,

John

I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal

exists as a Word document that would be great.  I have not yet actually been 
able to see the phase 2 site.

Ken, Ned,

Thank you both for your written advice concerning the marketing of LME 
registered contracts   I would be grateful if you could both answer the 
following additional questions:

1.  Can Enron Metals Ltd market LME Contracts to the 40 or so existing US 
customers of MG London Inc.(as well as, of course, new US customers)?

2.  So far as marketing by Enron Metals Ltd is concerned, do all written 
marketing materials (e.g letters, faxes, brochures, fliers and mailshots) 
need explicitly to be sent in the name of Enron Metals Ltd?  Alternatively, 
is it possible for such materials to be sent under the cover of EnronOnline 
but with a footer appearing on such materials referring to Enron Metals Ltd 
(e.g."Enron Metals Ltd is SFA registered")?

3.  In the context again of marketing by Enron Metals Ltd. - and I have 
assumed your answer will be in the negative - would any group relief be 
available, given that Enron Metals Ltd is part of the Enron group of 
companies of which EnronOnline forms part?

4.  Although I am sure you have already confirmed this, can you once again 
confirm that Enron Metals Ltd is free to market LME contracts to new US, 
whether MG London Inc. do so as well?

5.  In terms of marketing activities conducted by telephone or fax with US 
customers, I assume that this may only be carried out only by employees of 
Enron Metals Ltd or MG London Inc. (as applicable)?

Thanks.
Justin

Mark;

I've been working with Brazilian local outside counsel on this EOL matter and 
just had a meeting with Remi, David and Ricardo this morning.  For the 
purpose of finalizing the legal support (especially the review and 
"tropicalization" of the EOL agreements), I have a few questions for you:

What entity owns the EOL site ?
Will there be an agreement entered into between the entity that owns the EOL 
site and Enron Comercializadora de Energia Ltda. (and its designated 
branches) for the purpose of authorizing Enron Comercializadora de Energia 
Ltda. to use the EOL tool in Brazil ?
For the purposes of doing business through the EOL tool, would Enron South 
America (and its designated affiliates) or ECE have to enter into the PA and 
the ETA with the entity that owns the EOL site ?

Please note that I have only referred to ECE because I am working under the 
assumption that, at this point in time, we will only do power deals in 
Brazil.  In view of this and for regulatory reasons, the entity buying and 
selling power in Brazil must be ECE (the Enron entity authorized by MAE).

Thanks and Regards,

Sami

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL 
team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had 
heard back from outside counsel.

This is just a follow up on the guaranty from Consolidated Edison, Inc. which 
I had left with you a week or so ago.  As per the confirm below, the

Hey Mark, great to hear from you.  I actually went to Argentina and Chile
about 5 years ago for 2 weeks and had a blast.  I'd love to go back for a
longer period.  I was recommending it to Linda for a new place to go.

It sounds like things are going well for you in Houston.  I wish I knew you
were down there.  I was down for a weekend in July.  My college roommate and
his wife and their kids live there.  He's a 6th? 7th? year in Skadden's
Houston office.  Charles Still.  Ever work with him?  I'll let you know when
I'm back down there.

Have you been back to the Caribbean lately?  I was back in April for a week
in the BVI.  I really missed the place.  Do you ever get to Chicago?  Let me
know if you're going to be around.  Take care.

The suggested change below takes care of the issue of not being able to 
modify the threshold level to be counterparty specific.  However, I question 
whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a 
threshold, at least for Enron.  What is the danger of this provision being 
triggered by some nonmaterial disputed debt?  If having a bilateral zero 
threshold works from an Enron credit perspective then I think you could go 
forward with using this provision.  I am open to everyone's comments on this 
point.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,
Brent

Thanks for your quick response.  With regard to 6(a)(ix)(1), based on the 
fact that EOL is not able to handle counterparty specific threshold levels in 
the GTCs, I have considered modifying the provision as follows (the portion 
in red/brackets would be deleted):
"has a pre-judgment attachment ("karisashiosae"), post-judgment attachment 
("sashiosae") or other court order of enforcement issued in respect of any of 
its assets (other than its rights under the ISDA Agreement) in relation to a 
debt or debts [in an aggregate amount of not less than JPY[  ] (or the 
equivalent in any currency)] and such attachment or other court order of 
enforcement is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case 
within 30 days of the date of issue thereof; "
Please advise if you believe we should go forward on this basis.  Following 
Susan Musch's input, I will then contact Dale Neuner.
Cheers,
John

John,

Sections 4 (a), (b) and (d) cover the issues very nicely, I apologize for not 
making the connection before.  With respect to 6(a)(ix)(1) I am told that EOL 
is not able to handle counterparty specific threshold levels in the GTCs and 
I don't think a generic threshold level will work for everyone.  Is there a 
way to redraft this provision or leave it out and still accomplish what you 
need to?  

After the form is finalized then you will need to talk to Dale Neuner at 713 
853 9746 about loading the documents and removing the product from Enron 
Australia.

Let me know if you have any other questions or issues.

Thanks,
Brent

Brent-

Thanks for your correspondence.  I have responded to your questions/comments 
below in red and attach a clean draft of the GTCs, which does not contain any 
further changes from the draft you have provided.

Please inform me, with regard to paragraph 6 (a) (ix) (1), as to what, if 
anything, should be inserted for the event of default threshold amount.  

I have also copied Susan Musch on this e-mail, so that she can determine if 
all is well from the tax perspective.

Once Susan signs-off from the tax perspective, please inform me as to what 
needs to be done to load the GTCs, noting that the existing EOL GTCs for 
Japanese weather, are utilizing Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited as the 
counterparty.  My understanding is that those GTCs will then be removed.  I 
have also copied David Minns in Australia, so that he is aware of the status 
of this matter.

Cheers,

John

John,

I am attaching the GTC with a few changes marked in the draft.  Is this GTC 
only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp. and a Japanese 
counterparty?  The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties.

With respect to footnote number 1 you are correct the issue is covered under 
4(f).  Noted. With respect to footnote number 2 unless one of the parties to 
a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am 
not sure we need representation 5 (b).  We obtain essentially the same 
representation from the counterparty under representation 5 (d). Noted and 
agreed.

I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled "Early Termination" that 
you have deleted.  Enron prefers to have "Loss" apply for valuations upon 
early termination, especially in situations where there is not a liquid 
market or for unusual or longdated trades.  I think the weather market is one 
where Enron would prefer to use the "Loss" method of calculation.   See 4. 
(a) and (b) and inform me if this is sufficient.

I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent 
(unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent).  See 4. 
(d) and inform me if this is sufficient.

I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there 
is no withholding (for either residents or nonresidents of Japan) on 
derivative transactions.  Please let me know if this is not the case.  I have 
copied Susan Musch on this correspondence to receive her input regarding tax 
issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments.

Brent

Mark

I have attached a draft policy authorisation request to Skilling / Buy, in 
connection with the various "orphan" positions that exist in the firm but 
which do not necessarily fall into a proper risk management framework.

I would be grateful for your views on the legal implications of this activity 
as outlined, or at least how it ought to be structured to avoid legal "pain" ?

Regards
David

Mark, further to our converstaion this morning, I attach the latest version 
of the swap financing structure with RBC DS.  The idea is to have the swaps 
prepay a funded amount which is then repaid through the swap structure over 
the term of the transactions (1 year).  Please note that rather than 
determining the one year PV value of the funded amount and interest at time = 
0 relative to a fixed price, with monthly settlements then occuring in the 
normal course based on market movements, I understand that it is neceassary 
to have interest payments settled monthly with a bullet principal repayment 
by settlement at the end of the one year term.

Some explanatory notes:

1.  Bill Bradford's group is putting the credit terms together.  Once that 
occurs we will need to have drafts to RBC DS ASAP.

2.  Enron Canada Corp.'s obligations will be guaranteed by Enron Corp. to the 
extent outlined in the credit worksheet.

3.  It is fundamental to the structure for Global Finance that there not be 
any net collateral exposure.  In other words, collateral thresholds must 
offset or mirror each other such that if, for exapmle, Enron Canada is 
required to provide $50MM of margin to RBC DS,  Financing SPV will also have 
to provide $50MM of margin to Enron Canada Corp., notwithstanding that Enron 
Canada Corp. ought really not be exposed unless there is a market movement 
having an exposure value in excess of the funded amount of $300MM.  (NOTE:  
The actual amount required to complete the purchase of the PPA is 
C$235,840,000, the first installment of C$58,960,000 having already been 
funded by an intercompany loan from Enron Canada Corp. to Enron Canada Power 
Corp.)

4.  In terms of documentation, the swaps should be documented under ISDA 
Masters.  I understand that there may be an ISDA Master in place between 
Royal Bank of Camada and Enron North America Corp. and also one in place also 
with Enron Corp. (this will need to be confirmed).  As the transactions need 
to be at the Enron Canada Corp. level, however, I suggest that ISDA Masters 
need to be prepared between Enron Canada Corp. and RBC DS and between Enron 
Canada Corp. and Financing SPV on the same terms as the current ISDA Master 
between Enron North America Corp. (or Enron Corp.) and Royal Bank of Canada, 
subject to the credit terms provided by Credit.  The individual transactions 
themselves would then be documentd on transaction Confirmation Letters.  I am 
not fussed as to who prepares the paper and it might be easiest for your 
group to do so.  Please also note that external legal opinions may be 
required in respect of Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp.  Blakes is prepared 
to provide legal opinions for Enron Canada Corp. and whatever advice or 
support is necessary.

5.  Once the funding occurs to Enron Canada Corp., it will be advanced by 
intercompany loan to Enron Canada Power Corp. to acquire the PPA, and I will 
look after this aspect of the transaction.

6.  Please note that Enron Canada Power Corp. must put the Government in 
funds on Friday Spetember 22nd.

Soma, apologies, note that in the diagram there is no TRS between RBCDS & BF

Carol - I would really like to come but unfortunately I will be leaving on 
vacation (to France) on the 20th and won't be back until October.  I hear you 
will be at the offsite but is there any chance we'll get a visit up here 
before then?

MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.  The companies have 
also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).  I think RMT 
and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term 
plan for MG Ltd.   Please confirm.  Sara

P.S.  Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?

Enron Canada Corp. will be offering a Canadian power financial swap on EOL

Hi Mike, 

Re. question of what index we will use, we are proposing AECO C/NIT 7A Dec 01 
contract. Having spoken with our trader in Calgary, this is a liquid contract 
traded OTC & one that RBC trades in & is very familiar with. AECO contracts 
are CAD settled therefore avoiding the currency issues we discussed. We will 
include the exact contractual wording for the reference index in our draft 
ISDA.

As far as volatility, our structuring guy is running some numbers which we 
will pass on ASAP. As we discussed. I think we are talking in a range of not 
more than 15-20% for 1yr forward vol, and will provide some supporting price 
analysis.

Just to confirm, the interest repayment will flow as monthly/quarterly 
payments from Enron Canada to BF Equity Capital,  embedded in the swap as a 
margin on the index price Enron Canada pays.

Please also confirm that BF Equity Capital is the contractual counterparty to 
the GPA, & not 'Financing SPV' as is shown on the most recent structure you 
sent us.

Speak to you soon,

Regards,

Soma

I agree with your point in Ned's memo.  We would not be relying on Part 30.10

swap exemption.

I am enclosing a directive with respect to marketing pursuant to your

apply to Enron Metals Ltd.  These are not new and should be well known to

Mark can we put togethr a term sheet for the below deal. I think it would be 
along the lines of a licensing agreement to use a version of EnronOnline that 
allowed Natsource to transact with Enron on the behalf of various 
counterparts. The transaction attempt would identify who they were attempting 
to transact on behalf of. The deal would be a one year deal @ 200K payable 
upon delivery of the application.

Let's discuss.

Jack,
I should have set the time for 30 days. If it is 15 we will automatically
renew for another 15 days and therafter if apporpriate.

Here are my thoughts:

1). I think we will need to go to phase II immediately. From a legal and
control standpoint, doing the trades as Natsource with a give up to client
at end of day gives us a lot of heartburn. We don't really know who we are
dealing with and even with the margin it could put us in violation of
certain board authorized policies. The good news is that my head IT guys
thinks giving you a client application with a "pick list" is not a lot of
work and could be turned around in fairly short order.

2). We will make Natsource the first broker customer to have this app as
long as you guys are willing to work with us.

3). We are more interested ina one year deal at $200K.

Let's start negotiating, and see if we can't paper something prety soon. I
would think the technology could be turned around within 60days of signing.

Let me know,
Andy

Looking forward to meeting you.

Linda,

Nice to hear from you.  I sent Amanda an e-mail yesterday congratulating her
on the wedding.  Good to see that everyone survived and had a good time.
You must be very proud of your now grown up, married and employed daughter!
I heard she received an offer from Simpson.  That's great for her.

As for me, can you believe that I'm still here at Gardner and going into my
5th year!  Neither can I.  I need to go drop out and live on an island
somewhere.  I promise to stay until Nov. 4, though.  I'd love to get
together with you (we can even drink rum jumbees here) provided that I'm in
town.  I probably do need a tune up from you.

I am either flying to Miami the evening of the 4th or the morning of the
5th, I should know shortly.  Our boat is going down for the Mumm 30 world
championships.  A week of racing in the Atlantic.  Should be fun, but a lot
of work.  Are you coming in the 3rd or the 4th?

Finally, as for travel, my dream trip right now is Australia/New Zealand for
3-4 weeks.  I also want to get back to South America.  Have you been to
Argentina or Chile?

Let me know what your plans are, I'd love to see you.

Fondly,

Greg

Yes Amanda is still at amh5h@virginia.edu.  and mark taylor is at
mark.taylor@enron.com.  Mark came to the wedding - so he can give you
all the details (what the bridesmaids wore, the color of the flowers on
the cake - all that interesting stuff).
Mark was trying to organize another trip to the Caribbean at the wedding
reception.  I haven't been back since I was there with you.  So I guess
it has been too long.  Mark suggested that we go the weekend of Nov 4.
It was a coincindence that he picked that weekend, because I have a
meeting in Chicago on Nov.  4.

So either way Nov 4 will work for me - either I will be drinking rum
jumbees on St John or I'll be drinking [beer] in Chicago.  [what drink
is chicago famous for - nothing comes to mind.]  If I make it to Chicago
on Nov 4 - will you be there?

When do you think you will get to Manhattan (where we are famous for our
martini s)?  I am amazed that you are doing so well without any advice
from me for several years.  Really I think you should come in to town
for a little "tune up".  How are things going for you.  Your email
didn't have many clues.  And your family - what is happening?

I had a tarot card reading for my birthday (don't ask - some loopy
friend gave it to me as a gift).  Anway the tarot card lady said I am
going to be travelling.  So I am asking everyone where they think I
should travel (and that is not a straight line).  So what sounds good?
What great destinations are on you r short list?

Keep in touch

Linda,

Happy birthday to you!!  Did you spend it down in the BVI drinking run
jumbies?  I can only hope so!

How have you been?  I understand that Amanda's wedding was a couple of
weeks
ago.  A friend of mine sent me the announcement from the NYT.  You two
are
SO New York society.  I hope you all had a good time and everything went
off
well.

Life here is fine.  I've done a lot of sailing and golf this summer.  We
actually went down to the BVI for a week in April.  I thought about our
trips down there, especially our anchoring debacle at the Bitter End.

Are you going to be in Chicago any time soon?  I'd love to get together
for
dinner or a drink if you have the chance.  If not, I hope to get to NYC
sometime this fall and I'll give you a call.

Is Amanda still at her e-mail address at UVa?

Talk to you soon.

Fondly,

Greg

Subject: Re: Metal Trade Finance - Risk Memo
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-From: Paul Simons
X-To: Olivier Herbelot, George Del Canto, Peter A Abdo, Rod Sayers, Tim Davies, Lee Munden, Manjeet Jones, Phillip D Lord, Lloyd Fleming, Claire Viejou, Mark Evans

I have one principal concern in respect of one of the three structures called 
the "Commodity Transit Trade" structure.  The concern relates to the passing 
of title to the metal forming the subject-matter of the contract.  Under this 
structure, MCC sells metal to the counterparty ("Counterparty") on a spot 
basis with payment deferred (Contract 1).  Counterparty simultaneously sells 
back the metal to MCC, also on a spot basis, but not on deferred payment 
terms (the spot payment received Counterparty therefore constitutes the 
finance) - Contract 2. 

The concern is that, as the transaction has been explained to us, there may 
be a delay of two or three days between (i) legal title to the metal passing 
to Counterparty under Contract 1 and (ii) legal title passing back again to 
MCC under Contact 2.  There is therefore a risk that an event could occur in 
the interim which prevents title passing back to MCC.  The most likely event 
would be the insolvency of the counterparty, but other events (eg supervening 
illegality due to the imposition of sanctions) are conceivable.  More 
specifically, a liquidator of Counterparty could seek to disclaim (or set 
aside) Contract 2 if the market price of metal has increased during the 
interim. 

Consequences

The consequences stem from the fact that the metal forming the subject matter 
of these financings will typically be on the high seas bound for a third 
party (ie not counterparty). MCC will have a contractual obligation to 
transfer good title to the metal to that third party.  If title to the metal 
remains vested in Counterparty then Enron cannot fulfil this obligation to 
the third party.  Conversely, if MCC completes the sale to the third party, 
MCC cannot be said to have passed good title to Counterparty under Contract 1 
above.  In other words, MCC could be sued for breach of contract for failure 
to transfer good title to Counterparty or the third party, on the basis that 
it has sold the same goods twice.  

The likely downside is that Enron could be forced to perform both to 
counterparty and to the third party at a loss (or to perform to one and pay 
market damages to the other).  However, there is a remote possibility that 
punitive damages could also be awarded against MCC on the basis that it has 
sold the same goods twice, or possibly on the basis that the transactions are 
not "genuine" sales of goods, but a sham (this danger should not be 
exagerated and is mitigated by the choice of English law as the governing law 
of the contract). 

A further consequence would of course be that the financing itself would not 
be capable of being completed, with the attendant loss of fees/commissions 
etc, but this is probably a minor consideration.

Mitigants?

There are possible mitigants of the risk highlighted above, as follows:

Cross default - Contracts 1 and 2 will include cross default language to the 
effect that if Counterparty does not execute Contract 2, Contract 1 is 
cancelled.  Care should be taken to ensure that this language is wide enough 
to cover all circumstances (eg if Counterparty has "executed" but not 
performed Contract 2, would the cross default apply?).  More significantly, 
even if the cross default language works contractually, it may be overriden 
by the bankruptcy laws of the Counterparty, as invoked by Counterparty's 
liquidator. In other words, the liquidator may be able to "cherry pick" 
Contract 1 while renouncing Contract 2.  This could be checked on a 
jurisdictional basis, if considered appropriate.

As mentioned, English law, as the governing law of the contracts, may 
mitigate the risk described above to some degree, but local insolvency law in 
the country of Counterparty could override the parties' choice of English law.

Probability - As a matter of crude probability, it may be regarded as fairly 
unlikely that, within a narrow window of a few days or so (i) a Counterparty 
goes bankrupt (ii) in a rising market and (iii) its liquidator takes the 
point and insists on performance of Contract 1 while renouncing Contract, 
particularly in light of the fact that Counterparty does not have posssession 
of the metal and possession would be difficult to obtain.  This may be why 
the issue appears not to have arisen under past transactions.  It is however 
no assurance that these circumstances will not arise in the future.

Conclusion

There is a real risk of loss to MCC should the Counterparty go bankrupt after 
Contact 1 above, but before performance of Contract 2.  This risk is most 
accute in a rising market and is relatively unlikely to materialise in a 
given case.  If it does materialise, it is hard to assess definitively the 
possible loss involved, but this would be likely to be, at a minimum, the 
difference between the then prevailing market price and the price of the 
metal under Contract 1.

Please (anyone) let me know if you would like to discuss this before we move 
to a formal DASH.

Thanks

Paul

Dear Sirs

IBJ is now accelerating setting credit line for Enron Japan.
So we need some financial statement(incl. information of investment ratio)
of Enron Japan itself ASAP(by this week).
Of course, we know that 100% guarantee from Enron Corp is necessary.

Please be advised that not to miss a good chance to trade,
I believe that each of us must be completely ready for actual trade by next
Monday.

Regarding ISDA, we are looking for hear comments about amended draft that we
sent back.
And now I'm also asking the sample confirmation of "Lumber Cap" for
Mr.Steven Kleege in Houston.

If any question, please feel free to contact me.
And I very much appreciate if you kindly show me another good idea to settle
above rapidly.

Best regards,
Konishi

Powerex agreed to execute our GTC - as written - for our deal. They would  
prefer to put in their suggested changes for any future deal (prior to the 
execution of an enabling agreemente). 

Please advise on whether or not their suggested changes are acceptable.

Greg,

Prior to doing the one-year trade with Powerex I forwarded the traders over 
there a copy of our GTC (identical to the Duke contract).

The traders got the following feedback from their legal / contracts people. 
Their main concern is the language in section VII.

Let me know if you have any comments and what changes (if any) we should make 
when we send Powerex the confirmation for the Cal 2001 contract.

Thanks

Andy and Bob-

 Please see the attached draft of the subscriber agreement.  Legal is making 
some minor modifications to the agreement (typos, etc.), but I wanted you to 
have the opportunity to review the agreement in the meantime.

 You will notice that it is a binding agreement between EBS and the 
Counterparties.  What EBS askes the counterparties to commit is essentially 
that they will support the connection and router that they own in accordance 
with the way that we have engineered the service, and that if they make 
changes to their network, they will advise us so that we can evaluate the 
need for any modifications to the setup.  Since we are obligated to provide a 
minimum level of service and a redundant service to the best of our ability, 
we have to get some commitment from the counterparties in this regard to 
ensure performance.  The agreement furthermore specifies an interconnection 
order with facility authorization for EBS or its designate to install 
circuits.  The counterparty technical contact should be expecting this 
language.

 Meanwhile, we have ordered circuits as we have discussed and are moving down 
the list of counterparties that have indicated a desire to participate to 
determine customer-specific network configurations.  Felix Perez is the 
Network Engineer contacting the counterparties (indeed, due to his background 
in Houston, he knows a lot of the technical contacts!), and we also have a 
Sales Engineer supporting this effort.  As Felix determines the requirements, 
he generates configuration specifications and diagrams, if necessary, which 
are sent to the counterparty.

 Please let me know your comments on the agreement, if any.

Thanks,

David Mims

I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of 
a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought 
we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the 
Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain 
other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter 
now and I will advise.    Any thoughts?

______________________________________________ 
ITALIAN BANK TO BECOME MARKET MAKER FOR CREDIT.  
Unicredito Banca Mobiliare is planning to become a market maker 
for credit derivatives in Italy. It is looking at credit default swaps, total 
return swaps, and credit default options, and will likely be a market 
maker in these products by the second half of next year. 

JUMBO CANADIAN PENSION FUND TO PUMP UP EQUITY DERIVATIVES USE.  
The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, with CAD72 billion (USD48.42 
billion) 
under management, is looking to explore equity derivatives strategies. One of 
the 
most sophisticated end users in Canada, the fund is looking at starting a 
range 
accrual options and options overwriting program. 

INDIAN ASSET MANAGERS DIVE INTO SWAPS.  
A bevy of Indian asset managers are jumping into the rupee-denominated 
interest-rate 
swap market for the first time, which market players believe could boost 
liquidity. High 
interest-rate volatility, a better brokered market, and more future interest 
rate uncertainty 
are drawing the asset managers in droves.

Sami,

FYI, the forwarded mail below requests copies of my performance review 
feedback which I have already handed to Erica Mestre.  I think your mail is 
in reference to my objectives, for which again, I apologise for the delay.  I 
am aware that Mark is on vacation, however, I will be seeing him next week 
during my trip to Houston and hopefully will get his input then.  I have also 
spoken to Brent who said that in Mark's absence, he will be glad to provide 
at least a preliminary review of my objectives.  I will get back to you as 
soon as possible.  Thanks for your understanding.

Regards,

Andrea

Sara:
 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

To All:

Recently, Mark asked me to focus efforts on putting together a technology 
plan for the Legal Department.  Attached for your information is a draft of 
the proposed plan.

As you will see, the central goal of the plan is to enhance our position as 
essential members of the business team by providing - through the 
implementation of available technology tools  - efficient means of enabling 
our clients to meet their business objectives.  The plan attempts to meet 
this overall goal through three different, but related phases, each of which 
can be implemented independently.  Timing of implementation and dedication of 
resources have not been formally addressed as the plan is only in its infant 
stages; however, it is Mark's goal to rapidly move forward with certain 
portions of the plan.

It is my understanding that a meeting will be scheduled for next week some 
time to review and discuss the proposed plan.  Prior to that meeting, if any 
of you should have any comments, questions or ideas, please do not hesitate 
to let me know your thoughts.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

Gentlemen-

 Attached pleased find the revised Subscriber Agreement, with some fine 
adjustments in the language as we discussed last Friday.

 One amendment that we discussed was the removal of some of the language 
related to EBS equipment.  We have done this (note no mention of janitorial 
services), but have elected to leave the discussion of liens and insurance in 
the document, in the event that our third parties need to install any 
equipment in order to deliver the T-1 service.  If any counterparty has a 
specific objection to this language, we can discuss further modifications.  
Leaving the language intact, however, will lessen further delays should the 
third-party local loop providers require some assurances about their 
connection equipment.

 Please contact me if you would like to discuss, or reply to this message 
with your approval of the document.  Once we confirm your acceptance of the 
document, we will forward to the counterparties.

David Mims
