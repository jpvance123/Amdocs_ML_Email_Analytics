Don,
  Hope you had a great weekend.  Last time we had spoke,  I inquired about sitting with someone on your desk after work.    I hope the invitation is still open.  I would like to come up sometime this week, if possible.  As I mentioned before, I am really interested in power and working nights.  If you have any objections, please let me know. 

Thank you !

Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso

Johnny,
I have attached my resume.  I wanted to add to it the Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) application projects that I have directly worked on that have exposed me to the RAC side of the business.  I am not sure if it was relevant, however, I felt it was an important part of my motivation and interest on the trading side of Enron's business in addition to my own career objectives.  Though I recognize I have no trading experience I am seriously interested in moving in this direction.
Please let me know if you need any more information.
Thank you.

Don, 

Joe is a guy you definitely want to consider.  In fact, we wanted to bring him into our group, but we are in a hiring freeze and with the changes occurring in our group we don't know when we would be able to bring him in.  Anyway, just wanted to give you some feedback.  Hope you didn't get drowned out this weekend!!

Take care,

John

I want to thank you for passing my Resume to the appropriate person there. I will have a job interview tomorrow with Lydia Delgado (Human Resources) and Marc Dana Davis (not sure what department since Miss Delgado just mention "Trading").
I also want to take this opportunity to let you know that another friend of mine is looking into Enron, and I mention him that you could have a position open in your area. He has worked with us for 2-3 years now, and I fully recommend him.
I will ask him to send you a copy of his resume, and I hope that you can help. 
I want to thank you again for your help.

John and Kevin,

In response to your counter offer of $77,500 plus $10,000 signing I must
admit it just makes it where I have to be money wise.  And ENRON is very
tempting to go work for, but I have to decline for now.  There are things
here in the works at ACES, (I am not at liberty to discuss right now) that
make it hard for me to leave for the summer months.  I have been promised a
lot of things recently, some before our interview and more since then, that
would make my jumping ship a little premature.  By the way, ACES does not
know about my interviewing with you and I perfer keeping it that way.  If
ACES does not deliver on what was promised, then I will be calling you
again!! .

I will keep the paper work just in case, and regardless of that - thank you
for the interview, it was a great experience!!! .

Johnny 

We met briefly in derivatives training.  I currently work in large bundled structuring providing a due diligence function.  I am customer interfacing and give assurance on data that I collect and distribute to the various groups that determine the structure, execute pricing, and even set-up invoicing.  I have a strong energy knowledge and excellent customer service background.  

I would very much like to discuss opportunities!

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

I enjoyed talking with you today about opportuniites within Enron. I am not
disappointed with Shell Energy, but I really want to get back into wholesale
trading of Power.

Attached is a copy of my current resume. My resume does not reflect the
short contract consulting position that I held with Nucleus/Caminus.

I look forward to further discussions concerning employment opportunities.

I can be reached by phone at :

Subject:	Your Offer.

John and Kevin,

I have carefully reviewed your offer and worked the numbers several times to
compare ENRON and ACES.  With my raise, my salary and annual bonus is raised
to a point that makes your offer just not quite enough.  Add in the cost of
living increase for Houston and I would be behind the curve.  I have worked
the numbers and in order to be fair I would need $87,000 in base salary
along with the $10,000 signing bonus as well as at least 3 months severance
pay in case things do not work out.  I mention this because the annual bonus
is subjective and may or may not happen.  If you feel that this is
excessive, I understand.  I will be worth the extra money, especially after
this summer.  I will be learning to trade PJM, NYPP, and MAAC.  I will also
have the opportunity to deal more with SERC and FRCC as well.  I am willing
to consider your reply to this and will be able for discussion tomorrow
evening.  I will mail back this counter offer as well.

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to speaking with you soon.


Michael J. Byrne
ACES Power Marketing.

Molly reports to Bill Bradford and I know Bill is looking for other people in lue of the 2 Molly needs.  I will give Bill a copy of Travis's res as well.  Also, you can reference Job #'s 108954, 108911 and 104663 on Enrons job board for descriptions of Credit Risk Management openings.  
I hope this helps,

Hi Don,

  I was just following up to my last email regarding the status of job opportunities in your group.  I had a death in the family and was out last week.  I know you guys are probably coming up on bidweek now and have very little time to interview.  I would really like a one on one with you to discuss opportunities as soon as you can  make some time available.  As I mentioned before, having had the opportunity to go up and observe the guys helped tremendously.  Thank you again for that.  This is exactly  what I want to do.  I hate to come out sounding like a pest, but, I am eager to start.   I want to work the night shift and get back into the fasted paced environment.  Thank you for your time, Don, hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron 
intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading 
in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with 
EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading 
and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast 
(PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been 
interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position 
caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please 
let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

my desire to pursue opportunities within your trading group.  Jeff's positi=
on on my pursuit of other opportunities was positive.  Jeff stated that he =

ompleted the interview process and was given the opportunity to join your g=

n and finding additional staff to fill my current responsibilities.  This i=
s not an area that we discussed in detail, thus I informed Jeff that I woul=
d provide him with some additional details.  If the opportunities are still=
 available, I definitely want to pursue them further.  I'll will contact yo=
u on Wednesday to discuss any further details.  If there is a particular ti=
me that is more convenient to talk, please let me know.  Thanks again, and =
I looking forward to meeting with you again.

Don,

Hey, how's it going?  Gone fishing lately?  I talked to Kayne earlier today 
about a posting this guy is interested.  Kayne tells me you are the man with 
the opening.  I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look 
at.  Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position.  I 
explained to him generally what the position is about, but things have 
changed.  He says he talked to Larry Campbell also. In fact, Larry might have 
talked to you about him already.  I haven't worked with him before, so I 
can't specifically vouch for his work ability (Larry can fill you in better 
in that area), but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get 
along with...(team player).  Also, he is an internal employee.   Attached 
below is his resume.

Hi Don,

I know its been a while since my last email or phone call,
but I am still very interested in the position.  
Therefore, I am going to post for the position via Human Resources.
(Just so that I am going through the correct channels.)
I wanted to drop you a quick note before I send it to HR.

I am still interested in sitting on the desk for a couple of 
hours so that I can learn more.  Which day would be best
for a quick visit?

I hope all is well and I hope to speak with you soon.

Sincerely,
Joe Capasso

Kayne,

In speaking with the Associate / Analyst program today they informed me that you may still have a position open for an associate.  I am in the process of finishing up a rotation on the EBS trading floor and would be interested in speaking with you further if this position is still open.  Please find my attached resume, and I will contact you within the week.

I saw a job posting for a Power Trader (24-Hr real time) in the Enron intranet and I was wandering if we could meet to discuss further. 

I have been with Enron for about a year doing power origination and trading in Latin America. I recently moved back to the US and have been working with EES for a couple of months. Before Enron I worked a few years in PSEG trading and Constellation Power Source, but not as a trader. I know the northeast (PJM mainly) power markets (24 hour) fairly well. I have always been interested in getting into the trading business and that's why this position caught my attention.

I hope you feel there may be a potential match here. If you think so, please let me know and I can forward you my resume.

Thank you

Ignacio

Hello Don,

I am trying to get a job in the 24 hour trading group.  I was speaking with John Zurita and he said that
you would be a good person to contact.  Currently, I am in the Risk Controls Group with EES working 
strictly with Power deals.  I have been running a small group for the past year called the Contract Post-Pricing Group.  
In addition, I have experience in the Power Underwriting Group and have exposure to various pricing 
strategies, concepts and products.  

I have attached my resume that will give you more detail about my work experience.

I will give you a call later today. 

Sincerely, 

Joe Capasso

Hi Don,
Hope you were not effected by Allison this past weekend.  I was almost caught in it on Friday.  Kirit Purbhoo and I were up there with your guys and luckily we left in time.  Just as soon as we got off 45 (going North), they started to shut it down.  Anyway, it was still a close call. 

 I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how thankful I am to you and the guys (Joe, Reese & Steve).  By the way , Joe Errigo has given me permission to use him for reference.  It was a great opportunity to get some hands on training.  I really enjoyed the fast paced environment.  Now more than ever I am convinced that this is exactly what I want to do.  The opportunities which are available in your area (shift work and learning to trade and move power) is  very appealing to me and  I am eager to start.  Where I lack in experience, I more than make up for with ambition and dedication.  I can sincerely say that I will do whatever it takes to learn the position and learn it well.  I anxiously wait for an opportunity to interview with you and other managers on the 24 hour desk.   Hoping to hear from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Zarin Imam

Don,
Please advise of your interest in the following Candidates.

 

I am attaching the resume for Tom Tahl. Tom is currently a Foreign Exchange Options Trader, for Deutsche Bank in N.Y.

 
 Jeff Gerl is an Internal Employee who is interested in the 24-hour Desk position.

 
Steven Coulter is an Agency submittal, I talked to Steven and he is very interested in opportunities. The dot com company he was working for closed it's doors on Friday, so he is "actively" looking.

Good afternoon Don,

I am sending you this email because I was looking at the Enron job postings on the intranet.  I believe that I have a candidate, that according to the job description for "power trader 24 hr. real time" (#108727), would be a great match for Enron.  I am attaching the resume of Jason Vogler.  I am currently an analyst in the Generation Investments group within ENA.  I have know Jason for most of my life.  He is a very sharp individual and I believe that he is an excellent example of Enron's core values.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions that you might have regarding Jason or his resume.  Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Don, 

Thanks for meeting with me to discuss a job opportunity on the Hourly Trading Desk.
I am still very interested in working in the department, so please keep me in mind
if the situation changes.  

I already have a good understanding of the power market and I am a very quick learner.  
So I know that I will pick up the information quickly.

This is just a suggestion - Could I spend some time in the group when it is slow, maybe an hour or two, so that 
I can learn more about the job duties? 

Thanks again,
Joe Capasso

Please plan to pick up your new Associate at the Doubletree Hotel (conference room - Granger A&B).

Thanks,

Kim,
	This guy is a friend of mine and he would be a great candidate for an hourly position, or perhaps the analyst program. He has experience trading on the CBOT. 
Please look over his resume.

Hi Don,

Attached please find my resume for your review.  I liked to thank you for allowing me to sit with the shift guys for the past few nights.  The exposure has been invaluable.  I worked closely with Joe Errigo, who has been extremely helpful in showing me the routine of the job.  I received some hands on training with some of the work that is expected from the shift crew.  In particular, checkouts, price discovery, identifying constraint paths, input deals into the P&L  and Enpower.  

The demanding and fast paced nature of this position is exactly what appeals to me.  My past experience with trading and scheduling should provide a good base.  I would like to sit down with you and discuss opportunities within your group.  Again, thank you for the opportunity, hope to hear from you soon.   


		 


Thanks,

kp

Thank you for your prompt response to my phone call this morning.  Attached 
is a resume and cover letter for your review.  If you recall from our 
conversation Friday, I was visiting with Tony Vasut about positions on your 
power trading desk as an hourly trader.  The power desk is something I have 
been interested in learning more about for several months.  When you informed 
me of the current opportunities as an hourly power trader I was extremely 
interested.  I would love to meet with you or anyone from the desk at your 
convenience to discuss the opportunities in detail.  Please feel free to call 
at X58039, or reply to this e-mail.
Thank you again for your time.

Sincerely,
Andrew Greer

Don,

Hey, how's it going?  Gone fishing lately?  I talked to Kayne earlier today about a posting this guy is interested.  Kayne tells me you are the man with the opening.  I just wanted to forward this to you so you could take a look at.  Jay schedules gas for EES and is interested in your position.  I explained to him generally what the position is about, but things have changed.  He says he talked to Larry Campbell also. In fact, Larry might have talked to you about him already.  I haven't worked with him before, so I can't specifically vouch for his work ability (Larry can fill you in better in that area), but he does have good communications skills and is easy to get along with...(team player).  Also, he is an internal employee.   Attached below is his resume.  

John

On the chance that you might have an opening in the 24 hour group, I am forwarding my son's resume.  He graduates from Texas A&M in a couple of weeks with a degree in Finance.  I appreciate any consideration you can give him.  Thanks

Here's a guy I played football with that you guys should at least bring in for an interview.  He's got plenty of previous experience, and has been at some good shops.  He's a guy that would stay for the year to year and a half like we were talking about Juan.  He'd add some much needed depth to night shift until he worked up to days.  In fact, I think he went to the Austin trip last year (he's African-American, 5'11", about 220lbs).  He was at EPMC at the time.  
 
See you guys tomorrow,
 
LJ

Larry, 

Joe Davis asked me to forward his resume to you to pass on to Dana or whoever the appropriate people are over there in ya'lls group.  He is looking to make a move from CMS Energy.  I told him I didn't know if they were looking for any schedulers or real-time people, but you would know that better than me.  Check it out and pass it around for him.  I'll give you his home number:  281-491-3705.  He is looking for something ASAP.  Thanks

Lloyd the following people were let go last week from the OPS Group in EES and in redeployment.  I met them last week when I talked to John Wack their Director when I moved to 3AC.  John, worked with our group when he was in the Risk Group for EES and we were managing the utilities audits for customers.
  
Since everything in this company is about networking - I agreed to forward these to you.  Feel free to handle accordingly.

Again, thanks for the time lst week, I'll fill you in on my status as we get closer to the end-date of August 10th.

Dave,
   
   Attached is my resume.  I am interested in getting into the hourly trading area in particular ERCOT region.  I understand that you may know the Director of this region.  I would really appreciate if you could forward my credentials to him.  My most recent experience has been in power contracts analysis / pricing  and previously  trading and scheduling natural gas for the California markets for EES & ENA.  

Recently, I have had a chance to sit with the Steve Olinde and Joe Errigo to familiarize myself with the group and the job.  It was a great exposure and I am eager to talk to someone from that area.  

Again, I appreciate your help.  Thank you.

Johnny:

Thank you for your prompt response to my phone call this morning.  Attached is a resume and cover letter for your review.  If you recall from our conversation Friday, I was visiting with Tony Vasut about positions on your power trading desk as an hourly trader.  The power desk is something I have been interested in learning more about for several months.  When you informed me of the current opportunities as an hourly power trader I was extremely interested.  I would love to meet with you or anyone from the desk at your convenience to discuss the opportunities in detail.  Please feel free to call at X58039, or reply to this e-mail.
Thank you again for your time.

Sincerely,
Andrew Greer
