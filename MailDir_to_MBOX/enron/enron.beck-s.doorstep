Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is 
my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in 
this area pulling in other RAC people as required.


- RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected 
and on what frequency
- RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections
- I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a 
list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected, 
findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings.
- If follow up is not happening, a "red flagged" reminder notice should be 
issued via email. 

This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is 
one ball that can not be dropped. 

Let me know your thoughts if any.

Rick

I want to make sure that we address all audit points we can during the 
implementation process for 133.  Are there any points related to affiliate 
books, accrual books, hedging or policies related to that?  I know there was 
one on the affiliate or hedging policy.   Please send it to me and Ron 
Baker.  Thanks.

Attached is a response to the main observations of  Project Doorstep.
I would be interested in your feedback.  As a note the Settlements Residue 
Position has recovered significantly and we will  end the quarter with 
liquidations 
approximately $3k under the forward value or a 6% variation.  Importantly, we 
are in the black and heading the right way!

Thnx

THis should be considered work in progress as Marcelo is aggresively chasing 
the people needed to obtain the timelines.

Sally, I believe I mentioned the SAP delay to you last Friday and the issues 
of AS400 prioritisation ( a lot of very significant work logjammed ) but if 
you need more colour please call me

Mike, 

Please find attached  a status and time line of doorstep issues identified by 
Shona Wilson and the RAC group.

Note that some specific implementation dates have not been provided by 
responsible parties a of today.  I have asked respective responsible parties 
for specific dates and will update schedule attached as I receive the 
information. 

Further note that IT drives many of our critical dates.  Since our last 
meeting we have been advised that any AS 400 system changes will not be 
considered top priority as the IT team will focus on the off balance sheet 
financing that must be in place by calendar year end.  Also, with the London 
SAP implementation pushed off until April 2001, the credit aggregation system 
will not be available until such time.

Please let me know if you have nay questions or comments to the attached.

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Mike

Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try 
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the 
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed 
and "gut reaction" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of 
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on 
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to 
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion 
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

Ted

This is the latest draft that I have of the matrix.  John has seen this 
version; I am not certain if he has seen any updates.  

Please let me know the outcome of your conversation with Fernley - I am 
somewhat discouraged by John's remarks and would like to get any 
misconceptions cleared up as soon as possible (whether I assume a position in 
London or not).

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Re: Authorised Traders : Montreal & Chicago  

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our 
procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate 
action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
More to come.

Rick

I am still talking with John Sorrells and Tom Bauer about this to see if we 
can get efficiencies out of this process.  However, AA's first postion is 
that RAC is not independent and objective since they approve deals, are part 
of due diligence, etc.... 

I commit to you that I will continue to push on this and will let you know 
the outcome.

Dear Shawn,

It is unfortunate Tom did not bring up these points when the three of us 
discussed this on Monday.  I am unclear as to whether the work AA was 
planning to do on power is for their internal or external purposes as when 
asked directly Jennifer Stevenson said that it was for both audits (which, as 
you know, is frowned upon by the SEC).

In fact, Stacey was not part of the Doorstep team.  Additionally Risk 
Operations (myself) did not set up or perform the deal test.  Instead, this 
test was set up by AA and performed by members of RAC.  This can be 
considered a internal audit for AA's purposes.

Although it seemed that we had an agreement on Monday, it now looks as if 
you, Tom and I need to meet again and establish some additional ground rules 
in order to eliminate duplication of work.

Regards

Shona

Please see below from Tom.  It may be that they will not be able to rely on 
the work because this group is not independent and objective as an internal 
audit group should be by design.

I will keep you posted on anything I hear.

I am fordwarding to you the list of items we recently discussed in our Trading
status meeting. This list was compiled specifically for that meeting to
illustrate some representative  findings and observations. It is not a
comprehensive summary. Please review the database for all findings related to
our controls testing.

Also please advise who will be doing the Doorstep procedures on the West 
Desk. I
envisioned from our recent phone call that it would be conducted as an 
internal
audit function and I could incorporate it into my work on the external audit 
as
such. I am hearing that the team will include Enron employees such as Stacey
White.  If so, I would not view the work in the same fashion as if done by
people in your group or other independent group. Let's discuss.

We are fine with changing the fx issue to yellow.  The individual traders are 
currently managing the risk in their respective books.  The new associate 
will just determine whether it is more effective to manage the risk in 
aggregage versus separately.  Please let me know if you require additional 
information.

Thanks for the update - unless you disagree - the fx issue will change to 
yellow based on the fact that if is an issue that we can live with waiting 
until Nov. to close then it must not be extreme priority.

The following is the current status of our outstanding items:

Observation: RED:  Foreign currency risks are managed by the respective 
trader within each of the trading portfolios:

Status:  Revise target date to November 30, 2000.  The new associate in 
charge of currency starts September 15th.  Due to the complex nature of the 
problem, she will require time to gain an understanding of the currency risks 
in each of the books, and to determine the most effective process to manage 
the risks within the various trading portfolios.

Observation:  YELLOW - Due to the anticipated deregulation of the Canadian 
power market effective 2001, transaction volume is expected to increase thus 
increasing the need to capture transactions in an automated system 
environment (Enpower).

Status:  We are currently entering our transactions in the test environment.  
We expect to have Enpower in production for Calgary by September 30th.

Observation:  YELLOW - Term transactions executed via EOL do not 
automatically bridge into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of 
transactions manually captured.

Status:  Houston is currently testing the new functionality.  This is 
expected to be in production by October 6th.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.

Sorry, I should not have sent you London

Jeff Skilling and Sally met yesterday to discuss the status of the doorstep 
project, findings, etc.  As a result, Sally has asked me to put together a 
summary of findings to be discussed with the business heads, as Jeff is 
planning to contact them about the doorstep findings.

I have prepared a schedule from the doorstep database, ranked findings, and 
indicated which common findings were found in each office.

Please review this sheet on Calgary against the findings as you are aware, 
and give me your feedback (changes, updates, etc).  I need this as soon as 
possible, as Sally would like to alert the business heads as early as 
possible.

I am interofficing you the doorstep findings and ratings as I currently have 
it for your review.

Thanks

Shona

Kristin is planned to spend a couple of weeks on Doorstep in Feb I believe - 
this prompts a question......

When will EBS be subject to a Doorstep review? 

Let me know your thoughts.

Sally and Ted,

Brenda, Vlady and I met today to discuss Project Door Step for Mariner.  
Since Mariner is an E&P company rather than a trading company (or so we 
think), I believe our approach may be somewhat different from the other 
trading reviews.  The review will likely focus on the company's risk 
management policies and procedures which we  think relates mostly to hedging 
oil and gas production.  Based on a review of the last Mariner 10-Q (Sept 
99), it appears the company does a significant amount of hedging with 
financial instruments extending out to 2002.  The company also has 
significant ($14MM) of deferred losses related to hedging activities.

As discussed with Ted, we have preliminary planned to visit Mariner on Tues. 
March 21.  As a starting point,  Vlady is pulling RAROC information related 
to Mariner and Brenda is getting all Enron positions with Mariner.  Please 
call if you have any questions.


          
        Thanks,

         Jim

environment (Enpower).

Status:  We are currently entering our transactions in the test environment.  
We expect to have Enpower in production for Calgary by September 30th.

Observation:  YELLOW - Term transactions executed via EOL do not 
automatically bridge into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of 
transactions manually captured.

Status:  Houston is currently testing the new functionality.  This is 
expected to be in production by October 6th.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please let me 
know.

Subject: update on doorstep to business heads - calgary - with calgary

Sorry, I should not have sent you London

Jeff Skilling and Sally met yesterday to discuss the status of the doorstep 
project, findings, etc.  As a result, Sally has asked me to put together a 
summary of findings to be discussed with the business heads, as Jeff is 
planning to contact them about the doorstep findings.

I have prepared a schedule from the doorstep database, ranked findings, and 
indicated which common findings were found in each office.

Please review this sheet on Calgary against the findings as you are aware, 
and give me your feedback (changes, updates, etc).  I need this as soon as 
possible, as Sally would like to alert the business heads as early as 
possible.

I am interofficing you the doorstep findings and ratings as I currently have 
it for your review.

Thanks

Shona

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

Thursday April 6 beginning at 9 a.m. and extending though the day.  As stated 
in my prior Lotus notes on March 16, this review will focus on the finance 
and marketing functions of Mariner rather than the upstream operations such 
as exploration and production.  Attached is a org chart which was provided by 
the company.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Already taken care of......  I discussed this with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
last Friday and they will assure that a Doorstep type review is incorporated 
into AA's scope.  All agree that this is key to the due diligence effort.  
Ted Murphy has been the RAC sponsor for Doorstep so I will circle back with 
him as well.  I will look the scope over and provide comments once it has 
been completed.  Call with questions.

deal testing.  In order to weed out the origination offices from trading 
offices we have agreed the following approach with Brent.  You were 
unanimously voted as the man to co-ordinate the effort.

1.  As there are various suitable (i.e. ex-auditors/risk controls) Enron 
people visiting certain offices, they will use the standard questionnaire 
(Brent should send this to you) in order to establish if the activity is of a 
trading nature.  These people (so far identified) are myself (Liverpool on 
Tuesday), Andy (Germany & US offices from 19th June), Lloyd Fleming (same as 
Andy) & Tani Nath (Korea & Singapore next week I believe).

2.  AA are internal auditor of MG.  I have arranged with Sarah Williams to 
get the MG internal audit manager to organise a meeting with you in order for 
you to review the audit plans and understand what they have reviewed, whether 
their internal audit includes deal testing, how they have already reviewed 
(or not) the remote offices.....  You should plan to report back to Andy, 
Brent & I on Friday (please could you organise the meeting).  I have the 
audit report for MGL & MGMCC audit is due to start on tuesday.

3.  Once we have clarified the extent of AAs work we will assess what else 
needs to happen and who to get in to the various different offices to 
complete the reviews.

Many thanks

Naomi

Comment as requested:

"Discussions have been held with the current holder of the authorised trader 
lists for Enron Europe. There is a  process in place (as required by the 
Enron Corp. Risk Management and Trading Policy) whereby a list of traders 
authorised to transact with third parties is maintained and signed off at 
least quarterly by the President/CEO of Enron Europe. Further work will be 
carried out to ascertain where the process broke down, generating the 
Doorstep review point."

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Mike

Dear Shawn,

It is unfortunate Tom did not bring up these points when the three of us 
discussed this on Monday.  I am unclear as to whether the work AA was 
planning to do on power is for their internal or external purposes as when 
asked directly Jennifer Stevenson said that it was for both audits (which, as 
you know, is frowned upon by the SEC).

In fact, Stacey was not part of the Doorstep team.  Additionally Risk 
Operations (myself) did not set up or perform the deal test.  Instead, this 
test was set up by AA and performed by members of RAC.  This can be 
considered a internal audit for AA's purposes.

Although it seemed that we had an agreement on Monday, it now looks as if 
you, Tom and I need to meet again and establish some additional ground rules 
in order to eliminate duplication of work.

Regards

Shona

Please see below from Tom.  It may be that they will not be able to rely on 
the work because this group is not independent and objective as an internal 
audit group should be by design.

I will keep you posted on anything I hear.

I am fordwarding to you the list of items we recently discussed in our Trading
status meeting. This list was compiled specifically for that meeting to
illustrate some representative  findings and observations. It is not a
comprehensive summary. Please review the database for all findings related to
our controls testing.

Also please advise who will be doing the Doorstep procedures on the West 
Desk. I
envisioned from our recent phone call that it would be conducted as an 
internal
audit function and I could incorporate it into my work on the external audit 
as
such. I am hearing that the team will include Enron employees such as Stacey
White.  If so, I would not view the work in the same fashion as if done by
people in your group or other independent group. Let's discuss.

In my response to Brent Price on the London Doorstep review I alluded to the 
incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been 
identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying, 
especially as they concern the Continental Power operation:

As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May, 
and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder 
form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we 
witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not 
know our position.

The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new 
transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the 
state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits.

To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to 
develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain 
key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS. 

UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to 
the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked 
"off-system" and not revalued for over a month. Worryingly, there seemed to 
be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a Loss Notification memo, than 
answering some fundamental questions about why it happened.

As a corollary, our process of performing "risk reviews" has become all the 
more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market 
risk in the firm. I expect these to play a big part in our effort to 
stabilise these areas.

Subject: Re: Project Doorstep Responsibility Matrix  


Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments 
arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 "Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality..."

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

Dear Shona,

Actually, I am waiting on the deal test samples from Leslie (if this is still 
the game plan) before giving Jennifer the total package, which Jennifer 
understands.  She followed up with a call requesting a summary of findings in 
lieu of the working papers, at least for now.  She is calling me everyday, 
and I think it would be good to bring closure to this.  I have not heard 
anything from Leslie.  If you and Leslie are happy with the remainder of the 
deal test, I will x-ref the working papers as such, and we can ship the 
papers on to Jennifer.

Thanks, Shona!

Mike - thanks I got it eventually.

The only thing I would add at this stage would be under "Daily Management P&L 
and position reporting..."

"Key positional and valuation data delivered to corporate risk aggregation 
system ("RisktRAC") by a pre - determined time"

The form and content of that data I outlined in my last tome.

 

This will allow us to (amongst other things) get the positions aggregated and 
perform some level of assessment, and allow you folks to kill the spreadsheet 
you currently use to calculate VAR, because RisktRAC has the VAR engine.

How odd ? I came away with the impression that:

we would look at the outgoing commercial instructions to see whether they 
support the activity of the guys in Chicago with phones in their hands, and 
are in themselves wholly appropriate;
we would address the issue of not having taped lines;
we would address the issue of segregation of duties in the office, other than 
in Powerpoint
we would get to the bottom of the difference between the AS400 and "Local 
Access Database"
we would see a business model that defines how the office functions as an 
"origination only" office
we would see a revised timeline for the resolution of the other issues in the 
review

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Mike

Dear R2:?I would like you to consider the following in determining the appr=

Per your e-mail, please find enclosed responses to the Open Observations 
having missed Target date.  This is an update to clarify the outstanding 
issues which may have been outstanding on the Doorstep Database:-

London Phase I



The Authorised Trader Listing was released, with processes for updating, on 1 
Sep 2000.  Issue now closed.

London Phase II


No formalised process is in place for monitoring the receipt and execution of 
confirmations for Pulp & Paper trades
	Formalise procedures to ensure confirmation execution status is monitored on 
a regular basis and that execution rates meet Enron operating standards	June 30
		August 31


The confirmation process for Pulp & Paper trades is slowed by the Credit 
review process being performed by Houston- Credit	Move credit review 
responsibilities to London-Credit for European Pulp &Paper.	August 31

No established procedure in place to provide evidence of Legal and Credit 
review of applicable terms and conditions for Pulp & Paper transactions	Formalise Legal 
and Credit review and sign-off procedures for applicable Pulp & Paper trades 
and define those trades which Legal and Credit are required to review.	July 31
		August 31

The above points have been noted and considered.  However these points are 
forward looking and at present as there are no trades being executed within 
Europe for Pulp and Paper transactions there has been no requirement for this 
information.  Going forward taccountability for these actions rests with  
Cindy Horn and systems /procedurtes will be in place prior to completion of 
trades within the Pulp and Paper function.  Therefore all points are closed. 

No List of authorised traders for Weather, Pulp &Paper, Coal and Credit
	Formalise procedures to create and update authorised trader listing to ensure 
trades are conducted by authorised personnel and that FSA audit requirements 
are satisfied.	July 31
		August 31.....

The Authorised Trader Listing was released, with processes for updating, on 1 
Sep 2000.  Issue now closed.

Lack of Master Agreements in place for a significant number of 
counterparties.  Furthermore, the majority of trades are documented on 
counterparty paper or broker confirmations.

targeted counterparties. 
	
	
	 Develop a process to ensure Commercial, Legal and RAC review progress on a 
regular basis.
	
		Ongoing.....
		
		
		
		
		July 31

The elimination fo the backlog of  Master Agreements is ongoing.  The 
progress is analysed and reported within London.  Hence point closed.

No formal policies and procedures are in place for hedging and monitoring FX 
exposures across the company; consequently not all exposures are effectively 
managed by the FX trading desk.

level and at Enron consolidated level. Formalise Enron policies and 
procedures concerning FX hedging strategy.	July 31
		August 31......

Arthur Andersen are currently completing a review of the FX exposures, the 
first stage of two has now been completed.  Once the whole review is complete 
Enron Europe will work on the recommendations to ensure effective management 
of exposures via the FX trading desk.

	Confirms did not need to be translated when Norwegian speaker supervised 
London documentation function	Recruit Norwegian speaking staff
		
Yumi Joy Takei  (Norwegian Speaker) has been employed.  Not all confirmations 
are recorded in English as Yumi has sufficient language skills to interpret 
where necessary.  Issue now closed.

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

Subject: Re: Authorized Traders : Montreal & Chicago  

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Hi Shona,

Thanks for the update - I was out late last week for the RAC Conference.

Although the urgency of the situation was stressed when requesting this 
information, we followed up with an email on October 10 to Dan Houston 
(attached below) when it appeared that they would not be able to provide us 
with the information - the email gives an overview of the project and 
stresses the urgency that we obtain the documentation.

As you note that the information was there, have you already completed this 
portion of the deal test?  If not, and you would like for us to complete it, 
would you have the documentation sent to me at 3AC1904?

I have not heard anything from Pam regarding a meeting, but today looks 
good.  Tomorrow and Wednesday I will be in L.A.

Thanks, Shona,
Ken

Subject: Doorstep - Settlements

Dan,

The RAC group is currently involved in project Doorstep, which includes a 
review of Enron's trading activities worldwide.  Part of the review includes 
a deal test for each office,  in which we follow a transaction from inception 
through the settlements process.

Kyle Gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and 
G/L entries for selected transactions.  In fact, given the deadline Kyle 
indicated to us regarding his own group's close, we reduced the deal 
population in half with the hope of concluding our testing by today.  We 
understand that the monthly close will prevent Kyle from helping us any 
further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest, and that he will be absent 
this afternoon.

Given the large number of trading offices worldwide, each "Doorstep" is of 
very short duration.  In fact, part of the testing evaluates the ability of a 
group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of 
deals within a short time frame.  Given the "short fuse," we must finalize 
our report tomorrow at the latest, and present it on Monday to Sally Beck, 
Ted Murphy, Rick Buy, and Rick Carson among others.

It is important that we be able to mention in this report that the 
settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small 
number of transactions (10 overall - although some information has already 
been provided by Kyle).  Are there any other resources in your group who 
would be able to help us meet this deadline?

Thanks, Dan,
Ken

Subject: Portland doorstep report - finding followed up on

Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?

Thanks

Shona

Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments 
arrive too late. Here they are anyway:


1 Socrates

I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have 
primary responsibility for this system/project.

But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this 
project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given 
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in 
history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.


2 Exhaustive ?

It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to 
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such. 


3 Symptoms or Causes ?

Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will 
likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is 
applied. 
In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 : 

 "Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality..."

because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation 
errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright 
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think 
about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move 
on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they 
did. 

I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on 
Microsoft Excel all day, everyday. 


4 Overall

I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather 
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking 
off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.

As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has 
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control 
functionality ?

Dear Tim,

Thanks for the info.  We have followed up on all points noted in the first 
review and have found a couple more.  We will want to discuss these on Monday.

I should be able to send you the Doorstep reports for St. Louis and Chicago 
(updated) once David and Bjorn get a chance to review them.

Best regards

Shona

Subject: Re: Chicago Doorstep Review  

Thanks for the update - as you say, hopefully this summary covers all the 
issues. Shona?

Point #2 comes up in Doorstep after Doorstep. It was discussed extensively 
upon being raised in the Singapore Doorstep and Andy Cowx (Telecoms expert 
for Enron Europe) researched potential solutions without success. I can't 
help but feel that as this is a global issue, a global solution/answer needs 
to be found. Shona - can you take this up with either Sally or Ted and find 
someone accountable for coming up with a global answer.

Point #4 per the updated list of Authorised Traders and follow up note to Sam 
Hainsworth defining scope of what Chicago and Montreal may/may not do, any 
residual position that Chicago may "create" is pre-authorised by Sam and is 
an integral part of his global book. I have forwarded the follow up note to 
Shona this morning, and confirmed with Sam that he has communicated the 
contents with his staff in those offices, i.e. no local limits, however 
small, are required!

Point #5 Lou's list of AS400 development needs has been prioritised and 
depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are, 
this should be done in the very near future.

Point #10 we considered preserving the Helsinki typewriter in perspex, as a 
reminder to us all, however I am assured it has now been destroyed. Suggest 
that once the forms have been converted, this machine is rendered useless, 
e.g. remove the "e" key or take a spanner to it!

Per the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business - I will 
assume that the timing is acceptable to Houston unless we hear concerns to 
the contrary.

Thanks and regards,
Tim

Subject: Chicago Doorstep Review

Please find Derek's report on the visit by the Houston Risk/Controlling 
team.  Assuming that this summary covered all the issues, it seems that we 
are making progress.
  
Point # 1 - The problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to 
the other Enron office.  I agree that the sooner the move takes place the 
better but let's make sure that they are properly set up in the new office 
prior to their move.  The critical part of the move is to assure that 
availability to the AS400 is established, prior to the move.
Point #2 - Using cell phones needs to be addressed.  How are you controlling 
this in London and other offices?
Once we transfer the Scrap business to London (Jan. 2000) we will not have 
position issues in Chicago.  Until that time comes please note that Chicago 
has been instructed not to take any positions.  In the event of an unbalanced 
book, with an agreement from Sam, they will need a small limit..  Tim, Can 
you formalize this with Sam (see point 4 below) for good order sake?
Point # 5 - We need a better customer exposure report from the AS400.  Mike 
Sweeny should  help us on this front.
Point # 10 - "Russia/Bills of Lading/Typewriter"  - Helsinki is still fresh 
in our minds.  What can I say.  I told them to unplug the machine.
Point # 11- Stephanie reporting to Lou is not a problem.  Derek doing 
logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away 
all the middle office functions from his control.

Please let me know if you hear anything different.

		 Subject: Chicago Doorstep Review

Following is a recap of issues Bob & I discussed yesterday with
Shona Wilson, David Port & Bjorn Hagelmann:

1- We explained how all confirms/pricings/invoices were now sent
directly to counterparties from NY, not Chicago.

2- David Port was very concerned that we were not using taped phones yet
and will push this issue upon return to Houston as reason for us to move
to ENA before Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next weekend.

3- Discussed problems with confirming business when out of the office (on home
phones, cell phones or external meetings):
a)  Conversations not taped -- suggested that a conference call be made to
a taped line at our office to record the transaction, or that someone from the
office call the counterparty directly to confirm the contract.
b)  They were concerned about fixing prices without a screen.  We explained 
that
mostly we only fix premiums/discounts for later pricing.  When fixing a 
price, the
trader would either call the office or LME broker for a live quote and for 
hedging.

4- We explained that we do not have formal position limits because our book
is more or less fully hedged (as per JR's memo).  David asked if we had any
'informal' limits, to which we suggested +/- 500 MT due to buying & selling 
through
the course of the day, but unhedged positions, if any, would not be left open
unless discussed with & approved by Sam.

5- We agreed that credit functions & reporting should be strengthened, 
especially
to show total exposures by customers, not just limits or receivables.

6- Shona will follow up with Alan Aronowitz to finalize GTCs/Master 
Agreements ASAP.

7- Shona asked about progress with agency agreements.  Lou - please add this 
to
your action plan with Naomi Connell in London as responsible party.

8- Showed them our daily positions & AS400 positions which they agreed were in
good order.  Explained that NY reconciles positions daily and Chicago balances
AS400 vs. daily position periodically as needed.

9- They asked how we track overshipments and undershipments.  Showed them how
traffic dept. uses Access system to highlight late/over/undershipments which 
are
brought to trader for action.  Showed comparable reports in AS400 showing 
late shipments
and undershipments, but explained that overshipments were automatically 
zeroed out by AS400.
I will discuss this further with Sweeney to formalize reporting of 
overshipments for
tracking of position changes & contract overages.

10- Bjorn was very concerned that we use a typewriter to fill out certain 
forms -- most
notably Enron's 5-part carbon-paper insurance certs.  (Apparently Helskinki 
problem
involved using a typewriter to alter Bills of Lading.)  Bjorn will discuss 
with Enron insurance
dept. possibility of converting to electronic forms.

11- They suggested that Stephanie should report directly to Lou instead of 
DVD in order to
maintain front/middle office separation.  Also that DVD should be either 
trading or logistics/ 
administration, not a combination of both (Helsinki again).

12- Showed them daily P&L and trader sign-off procedure.

Dear Cassandra,

Here is what I put together for the Doorstep schedule. All the offices are 
planned for dates, but I've only matched people with offices through 1Q 
2001.  I have not yet met with Sally regarding any changes she may have for 
Risk operations personnel.  However, it would be great if you could determine 
which offices you want rac- market risk goto and who should go from that 
group.

Once we have cleared this with Sally/Ted we can have Lynn allocate people to 
the offices we want to do deal tests at.

Best regards

Shona

Since we couldn't get us all together on the phone (Sally, you're out of the 
office), I wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions we've all been 
having on Doorstep.  After talking with Rick Carson,  Shona and I see several 
alternatives:

Our Needs:
1) Database Management
2) Staff to do the deal test and write the report

No matter what, we want to use Rick Carson's group to maintain the Doorstep 
database.  

Our Goals:
The one open question we need to resolve is whether or not Rick Buy does in 
fact want Rick Carson's group to develop trading expertise with the goal of 
being able to do Doorstep visits alone without the involvement of Market Risk 
Management (MRM) or Sally's (Ops) group.  Rick Carson indicated that was his 
understanding from talking to Rick Buy.  If that is the case, we should 
select alternative #1 below, despite the inefficiencies.

If we are simply trying to carry out the Doorstep initiative in the most 
efficient manner possible, it seems Carson's involvement is not actually the 
way to get there.

Alternatives:
1)  Include Rick Carson's group to staff the deal test while including them 
in planning, interviews, etc. 
  - RC does not have low level people to do deal test only; his people are 
experienced managers/directors who would only
  be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business; 
it is also a management problem for his staff to be
  under someone else's direction so he wants their more active involvement

  Pros: - inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them 
documenting the findings in the report
   - training of a RC's group - is this in fact a goal?
   
  Cons: - no real need for a 3rd level of "brains" - we just need brawn
   -involvement by 3 or more people in interviews might be intimidating to 
target personnel, may be inefficient, etc.
   - planning and oversight with 3 groups "in charge" is inefficient and 
could cause accountability question

2) Don't use Rick Carson's group except for database management: Instead, 
consider one of the following:
 A) Have the MRM and Ops people assigned to the Doorstep do the deal test and 
write the report; bring a staff level person from MRM or Ops to
  do the deal test
   
  Pros: Efficient, keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can 
benefit most directly as trading is our focus (vs. Carson's group), no
   issue with managing staff, etc.; 

  Issue: Do our two groups (MRM and Ops) have resources necessary to devote? 

 B) Outsource to AA

  Cons: Little leverage on timeliness of report, not developing in house 
expertise, expensive, 


 C) See if there are other internal resources like the Business Risk 
Management / Energy Assurance Services group (Internal Audit), or 
accountants   from Causey's other groups, etc.


Assuming Buy does  not actually plan to transfer responsbility for Doorstep 
to Carson's group, I think Shona and I are leaning toward 2A  - it depends on 
what you two think about it - I think our staff level people would welcome 
the opportunity to participate and see other offices - the question is can we 
afford time wise for them to do so.  But if we want to train Carson's group 
with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary RAC Doorstep interface, 
we can do that instead.

Let us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans.  

Regards,
Cassandra.

Upon further consideration, the ongoing responsibility of Doorstep activities 
will fall to the Market Risk (Ted Murphy et al) group within RAC. My original 
intention here was to streamline a costly and time consuming process and for 
whatever reason it seems the exact opposite goal has been achieved.  Please 
discontinue any activities related to this project. Thanks, Rick

The following are my updates on the Calgary open items.

#1 - Financial Confirmations - Calgary participated in a conference call with 
Houston legal on this issue on June 15th.  Sally Beck is setting up a meeting 
with Mark Taylor to discuss concerns.
#2 - Segregation of commercial/non-commercial support functions - COMPLETED.  
Risk has set up a separate Excel spreadsheet to verify to trader's.
#3 - Enpower global data is currently being populated for Calgary.  We have 
requested access to the Enpower test database, and will proceed with testing 
once we finish populating the global data (2 - 3 weeks).
#4 - Term transactions bridging to Sitara - need an update from Beth Perlman. 
#5 - Reporting unhedged currency risk - COMPLETED.  Our net currency position 
is now being sent to the Controls group in Houston each day as of June 26th.
#6 - Managing FX risk in various trading portfolios - progress continues - an 
offer to hire a currency trader will be sent out on June 27th.  This person 
will be responsible for the resolution of this  issue.
#7 - Provide info on gas exotic & power data ;  The power information is 
being provided to the controls group in the requested format.  Once we 
receive confirmation that the information is being pulled in correctly, we 
will proceed with populating the templates for the gas exotics.  This will be 
completed by June 30th.

I will be out of the office the rest of this week.  If you need clarification 
on any of these items, you can page me at 716-2808.

Dear Phil, Joe, & Marcelo,

I wanted to drop you a line on behalf of your doorstep visitors to let you 
know we appreciate the time, effort, and cooperation the NY, St Louis, and 
Chicago staff gave us with our reviews.  The significant changes in the 
control environment have not gone unnoticed and I am impressed with the 
changes that have been made.  Additionally, we have all noted the willingness 
of the employees to adapt to these changes and their excitement to be part of 
Enron.  To let you know, most of the issues we identified during our work 
this summer have been cleared.

I understand that  you have been through the draft report for our visit last 
week to NY (which covered concentrates, copper scrap, primary aluminium & 
secondary aluminium).  Please let Veronica or I know if you have any changes.

Best regards

Shona

Dear Ken, Leslie,

It looks like we have gotten to the bottom of the missing documentation (it 
was there, it was quickly available, Ken did talk to the right people but 
they did not see the urgency of getting the information to Ken).  As a 
result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in 
the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to 
draft a rewrite of these areas.  

Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before 
we share the information with Portland.

Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?

Thanks

Shona

Sally,

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five "non-standard" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs
Welded Tube    1/1/98-6/30/05 PGE - NW 5.2-12MWs
British Columbia Power Exchange 1/1/98-1/1/15 COB 85-176 MWs
Harbor Cogen


Thank you for your help, Sally,
Ken

Good, valid points.  I think that I agree that we should not have a tour=20
strictly for "control" purposes.  Ted, how do you feel about the concept of=
 a=20
general business tour on an annual basis that would touch on, but not solel=
y=20
focus on controls?

Dear R2:?I would like you to consider the following in determining the appr=

 (as ?compared to your tremendous productivity at home base) but I honestly=
 believe ?it will be counterproductive. Here's why:??   1) While you guys a=
re on a plane or in a remote office, you will be less ?in touch and availab=

 many of them.?   4) Please don't take this the wrong way, but I question w=
hether you even ?are the best qualified from a skill perspective (Kevin Swe=
eney,     Vlady ?Gorny, John Vickers, et al might be the best to dig into t=
he details)?   5) When you guys are the face, it means the rest of us are n=
ot.  This ?means that our presence and authority, which will be required on=

Dear Lynn,

As it turns out, there is no deal documentation for the Panama City deals in 
Panama (everything is in Houston).  Therefore, the deal test will need to be 
done from Houston and we won't need anyone from your group to attend the 
upcoming doorstep.  Scott and Michelle Bruce will obtain the population when 
then are in Panama and also write the report.

Best regards

Shona

Mike, 

Please find attached  a status and time line of doorstep issues identified by 
Shona Wilson and the RAC group.

Note that some specific implementation dates have not been provided by 
responsible parties a of today.  I have asked respective responsible parties 
for specific dates and will update schedule attached as I receive the 
information. 

Further note that IT drives many of our critical dates.  Since our last 
meeting we have been advised that any AS 400 system changes will not be 
considered top priority as the IT team will focus on the off balance sheet 
financing that must be in place by calendar year end.  Also, with the London 
SAP implementation pushed off until April 2001, the credit aggregation system 
will not be available until such time.

Please let me know if you have nay questions or comments to the attached.

Shona

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down 

Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns 
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems 
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues
Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate 
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date. 
Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict 
systematically with the above instructions
All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls 
exist and function in NY
Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business 
communications on roles and responsibilities
Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and 
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens

Will call later

Mike

Dear Mike,

Thank you for volunteering some of your leads to work with us on the upcoming 
Doorstep reviews.  I have spoken with Sally and we think that in principle it 
is a good idea to get your people involved on a world-wide basis - the more 
resources we can use the better!

I have put together a schedule for Q4 00 - Q4 01 and would like to receive 
proposed names from you allocated to individual doorstep reviews. 

Attached is the latest draft of the Doorstep schedule.  Please let me know by 
next Tuesday if there are Risk Operations spots you may be able to fill (any 
with whom).  Also, as you are responsible for ensuring that the Enron Europe 
(with the exception of London) doorsteps are performed, please let me know 
which individuals you plan to allocate to these reviews.

Thanks,

Shona

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.
