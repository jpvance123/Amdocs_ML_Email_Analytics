Here it is May already. The days are getting longer and you're 
probably making plans for the months ahead. Planning is essential to 
getting the most out of your spring and summer. It's also the best way 
to build a healthy financial life. That's why now is the perfect time 
to discover the Resource Centers at Wells Fargo - with tools to help 
you make your dreams come true. Just like your favorite stores, our 
Resource Centers are stocked with answers you can pull off the shelf 
to help you with investing, buying or refinancing a home, and 
strategizing for 2001 taxes. Take a look...

In This Edition

Investing Resource Center:
A must-read for today's investment climate 

Home Resource Center:
Homeownership made simpler 

Tax Resource Center:
Planning now can help reduce taxes for 2001 


Investing Resource Center: A must-read for today's investment climate
Investing today is more challenging - and potentially more 
rewarding - than ever before. Got questions? Our Investing Resource 
Center is the place to go for answers, whether you're new to 
investing, experienced at managing your own investments, or prefer 
working with an advisor. And when you're ready to act, discover Wells 
Fargo Online Brokerage, ranked in the top 10 by Gomez.com for the 
One-Stop Shopper segment. Or look into Wells ShareBuilder(TM), a 
simple, flexible and affordable way to invest over time by making 
weekly or monthly investments, using the strategy of dollar-cost 
averaging to help smooth out the peaks and valleys of the market. 


Home Resource Center: Homeownership made simpler
The welcome mat is out. Our Home Resource Center is your one-stop 
solution for all your home-related needs, whether you're buying a 
home, selling, refinancing, or renovating. Here you'll find truly 
useful interactive tools to help you choose your options wisely. 
Afterwards, take a look at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, with home buying 
and home refinancing options to meet your specific needs. And with the 
recent drop in interest rates, now's a great time to refinance. 
??Want to unlock the value of your home? Try our home equity product
??fit calculator to determine the right home equity product for you. 
??Want to take advantage of lower interest rates and consolidate your 
??debt? Try our Debt Consolidation Calculator to see if you can save 
??on your monthly payments. 


Tax Resource Center: Planning now can help reduce taxes for 2001
Now that you've finished last year's taxes, it's a good time to start 
thinking about next year. How would you like to ease your tax burden 
for 2001? Our Tax Resource Center can help. We have tips on 
investments that can actually minimize your taxes. And we can show you 
how a home equity loan might lower your tax bill. There are lots of 
tax benefits in the areas of income, investments, homeownership and 
income in retirement that you may not be aware of. One place to start 
is with your IRA. For many, it can be a significant tax-reduction and 
retirement planning tool. See for yourself. 
??Which IRA is best?
??Home equity tips: Did you know the interest on a home equity loan is 
??tax-deductible? 

Tip: Investing in your 2001 IRA right now instead of waiting until 
April 2002 means you'll potentially have a whole year's worth of extra 
earnings. It just makes good investing and tax sense. Especially while 
the market is low. 


One Last Thought
These three resource centers are a part of Wells Fargo's commitment to 
providing information, tools and products for every aspect and phase 
of your financial life. You can find any of our resource centers by

Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

NEW VERSIONS OF  NYMEX RULE 6.57("POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION") AND

the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of  five (5) minutes
in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following
conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
twelve listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable

Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week

The Gas Trading Audit is scheduled to begin May 11, 2001 and is expected to 
take approximately two to three months to complete.  The audit will be 
executed by Arthur Andersen and led by Kate Agnew.

We will schedule an opening meeting with you the week of May 7, 2001 to 
discuss audit scope and any concerns or suggestions you may have.

The objective of the audit will be to determine whether procedures and 
controls exercised over activities are adequate and operating effectively.  

Results of the audit will be discussed with you and other appropriate 
personnel both during the audit and at the audit closing meeting. 

We will endeavor to conduct this audit in a manner that will minimize 
interruption of your normal business activities and we look forward to 
working with you and your personnel. Please call me at x5-4554 if have any

We have completed a audit of the current user access rights for the O:\EOL 
directory.  In our analysis we have determined that there are authorized 
users who no longer need access to this directory. 

In order to better maintain the EOL directory we will be removing your access 
to the directory.  If there are business needs that require continued access, 
please call Jennifer Denny at 3-5824.

Thank you for your cooperation.

FYI:  there may be a dup in the system from December.

Dutch is checking it out on his end and Jennifer is looking into why it may 
have been settled last month w/ no questions.

It looks like Jean verballed a non-brkerd deal that should have been brkered 
but the deal was never "actioned".
And Bianca verballed the bkered trade, which was "actioned" and then removed 
after it was corrected.

Thanks,
Sheetal

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much

Errol and Phillip,
Can we get together on Thursday or Friday to discuss the Utility Track for 
the 2 new Analysts that will join your group this summer.  The objective of 
this track is to have the 2 analysts serve in a Business Unit, but rotate 
function/roles as needs change.  We need to identify responsibilities the 
analysts could have at each desk. Please let me know what time works best for 
you.
Regards,
Melissa Prihoda

Errol -

Here is Alroy's number.  I would call him as soon as possible.  Let me know 
what the verdict is and when you talk to him.

Jeff,

I'm pretty sure that Errol hasn't talked with Alroy yet.  You can contact him 
on the tie line @ 7830 - 35568.  I know he is very interested in a spot in 
Houston, so any help you can give we would both appreciate!

Dave

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Since we are beginning a new quarter, we have cleared all FTE's in the hours 
survey so please make sure to complete the FTE's section of the survey this 
month.  You can enter your FTE's using the second button on the main menu of 
the survey.  When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are 
any Director (this includes Sr. Directors), Sr. Admin or Admin positions in 
your cost center, please complete accordingly.  You are not expected to 
complete a hours survey for these positions but we do need them to be 
included in your FTE's.

Please have your survey completed by Monday, May 7.  Please call me if you 
have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Roxanne
(X 5-8690)

John:

We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there 
are a couple of issues
we need to resolve with Paulo.  We should have a version ready for your 
testing by the end of this week.  
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

Thank you,

Here is the file for the Asian function. I am sorry about changing the

You may easily change it back to C style by using the replace function in

Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

are now valued in a Excel spreadsheet
- these are the Asian options that are similar to Gas Daily options.

Could you please send me the Excel or place it in the dropbox.

Dear Errol McLaughlin,

The Return of Cigar Aficionado TV
Our original videos are back, and this time we take you inside the Graycliff 
cigar factory in Nassau, the Bahamas. Watch Cuban cigar legend Avelino Lara 
run one of the smallest cigar factories in the world.

So You Want to Make Your Own Cigars
Doug Doan was obsessed with making a cigar rarer than a Fuente Fuente OpusX, 
so he dug up his backyard, grabbed a can of Ortho and planted his own 
personal tobacco crop.

Hey Errol,

I was just wondering if you could please get back to me about those two deals
that I've been trying to get some information on from you.  May Nymex is 
being 
invoiced today, April liquidations are being run either on Monday or Tuesday
next week, and I need to know how I'm supposed to invoice for QX0898 and 
QX0899.

It is very important that this gets figured out as soon as possible as the 
customer
is wanting to settle these deals, and we have nothing to show for it right 
now.

Please let me know what you come up with.

Thanks
Stacey

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.
