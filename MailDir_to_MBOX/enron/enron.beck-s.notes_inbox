Debbie is putting together a list of spreadsheets that these deals are coming 
from.  In the meantime,  we will start combing through some of the 
spreadsheets that we have.

Thanks

I think that it makes perfect sense now that Sydney rolls into London.  Sally 
and I have discussed this in the past and she will concur.  Hope all is well!

I dont know how 'international' the year end review will be. I will contact 
Mike Jordan directly and find out specifically who the line should be. I have 
discussed it with Mike when I was in London and his only concern was that the 
move to London was in line with Sally's understanding and that you and she 
was comfortable with it.

 Thanks for your help on this.

With thanks

Since a majority of the activity is power related, I would imagine that 
Justin should roll into the overall power group in London.  They may have 
other ideas!
The mid-year reviews were localized to Sydney only, will this be different at 
year end?

Scott

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has 
taken over from Alan.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have 
reported to you on behalf of Sally's area. I assume this has now moved with 
the rest of us and would therefore be either James New or Mike Jordan in 
London? Can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our 
PEP stuff, reviews etc.

With thanks

Heidi

One of Market Risk's primary responsibilities is to review Enron's trading 
activities and provide feedback to management, and management's expectation 
is that this is feedback and analysis is provided at the beginning of the 
Houston trading day.  Global Risk Management Operations in Houston is now 
providing Market Risk with a Enron Consolidated Preliminary DPR prior to 8 
a.m. Houston time, for use in Market Risk's morning meeting where we review 
all of Enron's trading activities from the prior day.  The only information 
missing from this is the UK, and I understand we do not receive the London 
DPR until 10:30a.m, 4:30pm your time.  
I'm sure you're working toward obtaining a final DPR earlier in the day, but 
meanwhile, we'd like to obtain a preliminary DPR that Global Ops can 
consolidate for Houston management's use first thing in the morning, as 
decisions need to be made each day based on Enron's consolidated exposure, 
etc..   We understand they're preliminary, but we work off preliminary #s 
from Houston, and I expect with the 6 hour time difference, your preliminary 
#s will be much firmer than ours.  We can start with just P/L and VaR, so 
it's not that many #s we need.  I'm hoping when we get the RisktRAC feeds 
complete we'll be able to see positions earlier as well.

Please let us know when we can begin receiving this information.

Thank you,

Cassandra Schultz

Sally,

Sorry for not letting you know what was going on sooner.  I contanted your 
assistant last Friday but she was walking out the door so I told her that I 
would call and make an appointment on Monday.  In the meantime, I threw away 
her name and cannot for the life of me remember.  I have been pretty busy the 
last couple of days so I do apologize for the delay.  Please e-mail me back.

Thanks

Sally,

Attached is the distribution for "All Analyst" and the distribution for 
Analyst 1, 2, and 3.  You don't really get much data by breaking them down 
because the groups are so small, but the overall combined graph provides some 
insight.   Let me know if you need anything else.

You might want to attend this meeting if you can.  We did some brainstorming 
today on what / how a Commodity Logic payment module should be and came up 
with some options that are quite revolutionary.  It entails some risk, but 
also has revenue potential as well.  We want to run it by both you and Tom to 
see if this is a direction you want to head.

If you're not available, then I can spend time with you to give you the 
overview.

Shona,

Thanks for your task force summary.

Below is what I have already produced here from the London perspective.

Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were 
especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems 
arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail 
? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where 
we are improving (or not as the case may be) on both a general and specific 
book basis.

Subject: Report on London Middle Office RiskTrac Performance

Debbie,

Using the data you kindly sent me I had one of my guys extract the 
performance issues from a London stand point and specifically look into the 
incidence of human errors  as those we can 'influence' immediately.

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this 
(approximate) 30 business day period and in fact there were only 5 human 
errors on around 120 officialised DPRs.

London IT are also going to analyse the data to try to pinpoint trends in 
their area.

Please let me know if this is informative.

Regards James

Just to let you know, since sending this memo we have not seen a marked 
improvement in your reporting.  We are starting to log each problem and who 
is late in reporting and will start reporting this information to you on a 
daily basis.

Thanks,

Shona


Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for

12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

As discussed with you earlier, here is the summary of changes/enhancements to 
the DPR group (to be implemented in order of priority):

Violation memos - to be prepared by 12pm by the next day for review by 
Chris.  Within two weeks of today this time should move to 10am, the goal 
that within the next 2 months certain violation prelim reporting will be done 
the evening of trading.  
Process - 8am or before DPR group to obtain understanding of violations for 
previous day of trading.  8-10 am write explanations, ensure sign-off 
obtained by trader.  10am - give violations to Chris for review. Issue 
violations as soon as group numbers are final (as a opposed to total DPR 
being final).  To be performed by Johnny Thibadeaux
Daily logs of problems - 
Late submissions - Michael/Johnny to print out log of late daily submissions 
and provide to Chris.  Chris to call business controller to let them know of 
late reporting
Listing of special problems - everyday the DPR group works on special 
problems.  Johnny & Chris to take over more of the resolution of problems (to 
free up Michael for putting the DPR tgether).  All problems and the time it 
took to work through them to be reported on a daily log provided to Chris.  
Chris to call business controller to let them know of problem
Daily prudency reporting - DPR group to start daily reporting of prudency.  
Audience to be determined (RAC wants it but I am opposed to putting it on the 
website)

Johnny is to push through these process changes.

If you have any questions/comments please call me.

Best regards

Shona

I had this discussion with Scott and Beth several months ago - in the 
Doorstep - "enpower" is a metaphor for a risk management system that isn't an 
abomination (which was the current state at the time).  Have they made 
improvements to said abomination that are acceptable for the current level of 
business. Enpower seems to be acceptable to all.  Clearly, my appetite for 
supporting more risk on an inferior platform is close to zero.  More 
importantly in the global competition for capital of all kind, the standard 
is not controlled spreadsheets, i.e., last time I spoke to Peter Lynch, Jim 
Rogers, and Archie McCallister, they were on more sophisticated platforms 
with infinitely more functionality.
Peace an Love
Ted

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production. 

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use "WSCC", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the "Re:" say "Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000"
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

David,

I suggest we have another conference call at which Marcelo, Andy and I go 
through this one more time for any interested parties. I will call you this 
afternoon to schedule a time.

Thanks and regards,
Tim

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no "Chicago Book" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the "envelope" which you mention, which appears to be a 
delegated trading authority, in which case we are back to "square one" it 
would appear.

Help me out.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

Regards
Andy

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Re: Authorised Traders : Montreal & Chicago  

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Please see the BOD approved limit changes and notification level changes 
currently in effect for today's business, 12/12/00: 1) see Risk Mgmt memo for 
summary of changes to policy, see Policy for summary of limits in effect 
except for Temporary Limits noted below (I sent you these same documents a 
week ago, so you're probably already familiar with them).  As you make these 
changes, I'd suggest revising the order of the commodity listings on the DPR 
to conform more closely with the management / trading responsibility 
organization structure announced November 8th (let me know if you do not have 
the e-mail from Skilling/lay with the attached org. charts.)  Also see the 
assignment of Head Traders to specific commodities below - the EWS memo below 
was approved by Greg Whalley yesterday.




So I'd suggest deleting the South America and Asia Africa subtotals and 
putting under Enron Americas and Enron Europe, respectively.

Other changes we've discussed:
removing Structured Derivatives reporting as that P/L should be aligned 
against power or gas risk limits

Other DPR Issues to address: 
The Risk Management policy requires Loss notification monitoring and 
reporting to be measured without the effect of change in prudency and without 
origination:
Reporting changes in prudency - we'd like this to be a bit more transparent, 
there's Lavorato's "Management Book", and Schedule C, and we're not clear 
what drives the changes, so it's more rather than less difficult to 
measure/evaluate trading results
Developing a consistent approach among commodities to report origination vs. 
trading - - - few commodity groups report origination separately, yet the 
area at the bottom of the DPR that says "US and International Originations" 
implies that the amounts reported above exclude origination when that in fact 
is not the case
Need to get EES and the UK to report earlier so we can see preliminary DPR 
with all risk and P/L by 8 a.m. Houston time

Temporary Limits and Discretionary VaR Allocations approved by the BOD, but 
not reflected in the Policy above:

    12/7 - 12/22  Permanent
Aggregate VaR Limit  $140 MM  $100 MM

NA Gas    $110 MM  $60 MM  ($60 permanent limit, + $15 Discretionary VaR on 
12/6 + $35 Temporary VaR)

UK Power   $20.3 MM  $15.3 MM ($15.3 limit until 1/1/01 + $5MM Temporary VaR)


Other Limit Issues - I'll let you know if these are extended or modified:
EES's $2MM of Discretionary VaR expires Friday, the 15th
After 12/22, we'll need to re-evaluate the $15MM Discretionary VaR allocated 
to NA Gas


Regards,
Cassandra.

We need to prepare the Proof of Claim in the Perry Gas Companies, Inc. 
bankruptcy.     The debtor's  Schedule F filed  29-Sep-2000, with balances as 
of the bankruptcy filing date of 28-Aug-2000,  indicated the amount of our 
claims:


Creditor                                                                      
       Amount
Clinton Energy Management Services               $   702,150.00
Enron Energy Services                                            $5,387,076.11
Enron North America                                                 
$1,948,233.60

I need by the close of business Friday, December 17th:

1. Please have the amounts verified by your respective area (ENA/EES).      
The accuracy of these figures is quite important.
2. Copies of all the legal documentation for your transaction(s).  We will 
need to file this with the court as an attachment

Please call if you have any questions.

Lexi,
I have a concern regarding the summer internship position....
I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.
Whittney Skinner

Sally

CommodityLogic's financial management module is offering an "exposure 
tracker" in its version 2.0 release scheduled for Dec 15.  The credit 
deparment has raised issues on the accuracy of the data this feature will 
display and has suggested we meet with you and your group to discuss how we 
can ensure we have good data.   Apparently, they have to do a lot of manual 
calculations on the existing data, and we are asking for a daily feed with 
lots of counterparties.

I'd like to set up a meeting for Tues or Wednesday of this week to discuss 
how we can address this issue;  what time is best for you?  Call me if you 
need more info - 5-3992.   I'd like to have Tom Gros, Bill Bradford, me, and 
you and someone from your group there if possible. 

thanks!!

Here is the draft of the needs assessment for global standards.  Please give 
me your input.  Kelly is devoting 100% of her time to putting together an 
access database to report these standards.

Also, here is a consolidated view of A01 for 12 /04.

Today, December 7th, the Executive Committee of the BOD met and approved the 
following temporary limit increases:

    12/7 - 12/15  12/6
Aggregate VaR Limit  $140 MM  $100 MM

NA Gas    $110 MM  $75 MM  ($60 permanent limit, + $15 Discretionary VaR on 
12/6 + $35 Temporary VaR)

UK Power   $20.3 MM  $15.3 MM


Please revise the DPR accordingly.

For your information, the proposed limit changes and P/L notification level 
changes we are submitting to the BOD are in the attached memo - these will be 
effective the day of the BOD meeting, Tuesday 12/12, except that given market 
activity, the NA Gas, UK Power, and Agg Enron VaR limits may be revised.   
Given the changes that will be necessary next week to the DPR, that might be 
a good time to re-format the reporting along the new business unit lines.  
You can see how we did so in the policy attached.



Thank you,
Cassandra.

Ted informed me that Jeff Skilling and Rick Buy have agreed to a 
discretionary VaR allocation of $15MM effective today through December 15th 
(next Friday) for a total North American Natural Gas VaR of $75MM.

That increases our Aggregate VaR Limit for Enron to $100MM for that same 
period.

Please modify notification and DPR reporting accordingly.

Cassandra Schultz.

David

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

Regards
Andy

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Sally,

I wanted to send you a short note to tell you about the success of last 
nights Office of the Chairman Holiday Assistant's Party.

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was 
because of Heather Choate.  I sent out ONE email to Patti and she recruited 
Heather who made huge efforts to get some wonderful gifts to be given out. 

It is nice to see people truly going above and beyond!  She was a superstar!

I just saw this presentation on EnVera and couldn't help but think this is 
the concept you were promoting yesterday as a data hub/exchange.  Seems like 
that is the EnVera strategy as well.

Athena is a powerful and flexible tool.  The members of RAC have shown great 
interest in Athena, and we should expect to see several of them at today's 
instructional class.  

We think that Energy Operations will similarly find Athena very useful, and 
we strongly encourage you to sign up for Thursday's class or to stop by 
today's (4:00 in EB 3270).

Regards,



Eugenio

Subject: Rollout of ATHENA (Formerly known as the DPR database)


Dear All,
 
Risk Analytics, has recently finished developing ATHENA (the database that 
warehouses all of the official DPR data of Enron), which is designed to make 
your work easier by giving you the following tools and breakdowns:

1. P&L Component Breakdowns
? Hedge Management
? Prudency
? Curve Shift
? New Deals

2. Risk Analysis Tools
? VARs
? Maturity Gap Risk
? Net Open Position
? Daily loss limits

The warehoused information, which is broken down by books and parts (P&L 
component breakdowns/risk analysis tools), now has the visual aid of numerous 
bar graphs and pie charts used to represent the information listed above - 
provided to you at the touch of a button.  These charts are not only very 
easy to understand, but will be helpful in your daily work analyzing trading 
information.  

Now that all commodity groups are performing additional analysis and 
providing reports other than P&L and positions to both MRM RAC and commercial 
departments, the tools provided by ATHENA have been proven to be extremely 
useful.  

ATHENA makes analysis of the time trend of data an effortless process, as it 
has warehoused data for the past year for each commodity.

The rollout of ATHENA is currently underway, according to the following 
timeline:

? From now until Friday November 10th, access to the database is being given 
to the beta testers (testers already chosen).
? Monday November 13th - First instructional training class from 4-5pm. 
Conference room 3270.
? Thursday November 16th - Second instructional training class from 3-4pm.  
Conference room 3270.  
? Subsequent classes will be scheduled depending on need.
? Production users will have access to the database within the few weeks 
following November 16th.
  
Each of these sessions will hold up to 15 participants, and attendees are 
taken on a first come first serve basis.  Please contact Pamela Sonnier (ext. 
37531) to sign up for one of these training sessions.

We expect that all business controllers will want to have access to ATHENA. 
Additionally, there may be other employees in your group who need access.  
Please send all requests for access to ATHENA to Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon 
(ext. 35257), Jennifer Nguyen (ext. 57590), or Eugenio Perez (ext. 35828) 

For further information on ATHENA, or to set up a one on one demonstration, 
call Eugenio Perez (X35828), Maria Teresa Peon (X35257) or Jennifer Nguyen 
(X57590).

Best regards and looking forward to working with you,


Risk Analytics

Dear Project Sunrise Interviewees:

In order to complete gathering technical requirements, we will need to 
conduct some follow-up interviews.   I will be scheduling the interviews with 
all participants starting Wednesday December 6, 2000 to Monday, December 11, 
2000.  Tuesday, December 12th will be reserved for rescheduling of 
interviews.   

The interviews will be scheduled for 30 minutes and will be conducted by two 
members of the Project Sunrise technical team.   Before conducting the 
interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to 
determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to 
replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to 
limit your time commitment.  

Typical follow-up questions will be:   
What are your sources of data/information?  
Where is the data/information currently stored?  
Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.   

Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to 
the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.  
Please let me know your availability.  We will work around your schedule but 
would prefer to conduct the interviews 9:00 am to 2:00 pm to permit writeups 
to be done in the afternoon.  

Thank you very much for your participation and patience.

Bob,

I spoke with Tom this morning regarding your ideas below. 

He is certainly willing to recommend that members of the Diamond Technology 
team participate on the UNIFY team to meet the goals.  In fact, we can give 
information with respect to "who" may be a good fit for this type of work.  
We are willing to help in any manner. . . 

The UNIFY budget would need to accept the Diamond charges for the work.  Let 
me know what you think. . .

Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Re: ?? Re: KX/UNIFY interface schedule  

The citygate EOL business is getting even crazier. In fact the other day I 
had to respond to an LDC that is continually getting late information and is 
being told by marketers that it's Enrons fault. Bottom line is from my 
perspective I believe KX will make a big difference and we need a fully 
integrated product ASAP.  As we know resources are limited on the Unify side 
and they have some other critical items that they are being pressed to get 
done. As I review your options below it's hard to decide what we have to give 
up. I'm afraid if we don't have a fully integrated product that the customers 
might get frustrated if their waiting for Enron to do their part. Obviously 
the more "automatic" we make it on our side the quicker data will be made 
available.

Question? Do you have the resources that can be dedicated to the Unify team 
ASAP to work exclusively with them to get this all done? My understanding is 
you have a significant number of people available and this is in fact part of 
the project. I'm afraid if we rely solely on the Unify team to provide the 
resources we can expect significant delays. I'm sure they would be more than 
willing to accept any help you could provide them with. 

Let me know what you think, thanks - Bob Superty

Please review the attached message and provide your feedback.  In addition, 
we would like to reschedule the demo with you all as soon as you are 
available.  I think that Heather is checking your calendars.  

Bob-
We did not have the questions below when we met with you last week for the 
demo.  As such, please provide your feedback.  

Victor/Ed-
You received this today in the demo, but here is the electronic version if 
you need it.

We would like to get some resolution on these questions this week.  Please

Subject: ?? Re: KX/UNIFY interface schedule

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are working with Matt Pena and Dave N. re:  KX/UNIFY 
interfaces.  Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to 
release functionality.  Please review and let us know if anything should be 
in a different order.  

As you can imagine, (1)  the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at 
once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible.  
You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it 
is appropriate.  We should target things that give you and your customer the 
biggest bang for your buck.

FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow.

1.  UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX
2.  UNIFY sends psna's to KX
3.  UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX
4.  UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX
5.  UNIFY will "undo" upstream and downstream K#
6.  UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX
7.  UNIFY will "undo" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions
8.  UNIFY will receive psna's from KX
9.  UNIFY will "undo" psna's from KX

Thanks,
Carrie

P.S.  Could we live without #2 and #3?  This appears difficult to implement, 
and we would like to guage the cost/benefit.  

Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all 
other data.  In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to 
be entered into KX for the user to see them.  They would, however, interface 
back to UNIFY once entered.  However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, 
then they would not show up in KX.  Give us your thoughts. . .

Sally - 

FYI.  Having never worked with Whalley before, I may never hear back from 
him.   We'd like to obtain documentation signed by Skilling/Buy authorizing 
the top traders for specific commodity groups (Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman), 
then we'll get those top traders to designate head traders, and so on down 
the line.  If you have any insight as to the commodity group assignments 
listed below, please let me know.  And since you probably see Whalley often, 
perhaps you could mention it.  I think Shona's group wants to reclassify the 
DPR accordingly, but they're not certain on some of these either.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Head Trader Authorization

Greg -

We haven't met yet - I joined Market Risk Management working for Ted Murphy 
about a month ago, focusing on the Risk Management Policy.  One item I'm 
working on is documentation of the Head Traders and Authorized Traders.    It 
seems after the organizational anouncement last week that you are the top 
management and focal point for all of the trading activities in Enron 
Wholesale Services.  As such, would you please review the draft memo below 
(also attached) and confirm whether this appropriately documents your wishes 
as far as designation of Head Traders for each commodity group authorized in 
the policy?  We'd like to get Skilling/Buy to sign this top level of trading 
authority delegation.  Then I'll obtain from each of the Head Traders their 
respective lists of Authorized Traders to whom they've further delegated 
trading authority.  This will support Rick Buy's goal that RAC maintain a 
list of authorized traders, with the appropriate documentation of that 
authorization.

Please don't read anything into the assignments themselves if I got them 
wrong - we made an educated guess with all the recent reorganizations.  For 
example - who is the Head Trader for Southern Cone Gas and Power - is it 
really Kishkill?  And as McMahon and Bowen aren't traders, do trading 
activities for Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel fall to Sherriff or someone 
else?  

If you prefer me to obtain Head Trader names for each commodity group from 
Lavorato/Sherriff/Shankman, I can do so, but please confirm I have the 
commodity group responsibilities correct among the 3 of them.

Thank you,

I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower.  His 
concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently 
working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on 
correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades 
many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of 
not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.  
The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises 
and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals.  The 
idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other 
more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal 
specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have.  Once the technology is 
in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt.   The system was 
originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US 
and as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a 
financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption 
vols and asian options are two of these enhancements. 

Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an 
option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be 
sure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems, 
but it will give him a starting place.

Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT 

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

I am putting together an analysis of these guys right now since they just 
came on the scene.  I want to talk to Tom more about this company before I 
finish the document because he has a great contact there. The JV with Prebon 
Yamane is not that strong but having Amerex and The Bank of New York is 
huge.  Please keep me informed of any other information you hear about Energy

Whittney:

The internships are slated to last from 10 to 12 weeks.  If you are able to 
complete 10 weeks, there will not be a problem.  We actually had the same 
problem with candidates last year.  Please just indicate your date 
considerations on your offer letter so that HR knows you will not be here a 
full 12 weeks.  As long as we know in advance, there should not be a problem.

Thank you so much!

Lexi,
I have a concern regarding the summer internship position....
I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.

On a monthly basis, the Rate and Currency Desk submits interest rate and 
foreign currency spot curve validations to the Risk Controls group.  In the 
past this data was sent via email to either Mike Moscoso, Chris Abel or Gary 
Stadler.   Going forward we will send infomation to Eugenio Perez.  FYI - 
Arthur Andersen audits these curve validations annually.

Attached please find the curve validation procedures, including source pages, 
and most current validation dated 10/31/00.  I will be more than happy to go 
over the validation process in detail if interested.

Sally - just an fyi...  Jeff Hodge requested that we send him the information 
below.  Evidently, the FERC has requested that several US wholesale companies 
provide a great deal of information to them due to the volatility of natural 
gas prices the past few weeks (it is being driven by the California 
markets).  Legal got them agree to simply giving them a weighted average 
price of gas on the 11th for delivery on the 12th.  It worked out as $24.47 
for buys and $18.14 for sales.  This is US physical next day only.

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

I'd like to get together as a group and discuss both Commodity Logic & DCAF 
projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for 
supporting the trade clearing functions.  Here are the items I'd like to 
initially discuss:

Commodity Logic Deliverables, timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to 
show where we currently are in our development.
Current DCAF requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user 
side.
Legal & Credit concerns or issues known at this time.

Once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then let's follow up 
with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority 
concerns that were brought up at the Deal Clearing JAD session. 

 Cheryl:  Please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed 
under cc: above to discuss the subject listed above.  I'd like to meet ASAP 
and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled 
sooner than later.

Sally - Plse see the attached summary that Risk Ops prepares for 
Frevert/Sherriff/Brown on Enron Europe every week.  Do your business unit 
controllers prepare something like this for the Americas, EGM, & EIM that we 
could use in our weekly briefing to Rick Buy?  What's happening is we try to 
prepare our own analysis of the trading P/L, and it really doesn't make much 
sense to do that since Ops is probably already doing it.  I'd love to get 
looped in to similar analyses for the other business units.  Also, do you 
know who I'd contact in  EES?  I'll call Barry Pearce for EBS.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Rick Buy report  


Attached is a copy of the latest European Trading Summary. 
As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I 
suggested to Ted that we stop duplicating work and simply use this report.



The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready 
when the Rick gets in the office.
People to contact wrt co-ordination are, Michael Kass or his superior James 
New.

Please let me know if this report will be used in this week's Rick Buy report.

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly Enron Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

I ran across this article in the Yomiuri Newspaper (but I cannot find it in 
the US press) and thought you might find it interesting in light of our 
inroads into Japan.

The presidents of Tokyo Power and Chubu Power announced that in the spring, 
they and eight other Japanese power companies would merge their 
telecommunications and Internet businesses into a new company.  This company 
seems to be based on a telecommunications joint venture (PNJ Communications) 
that they formed last year.  They are hoping to get 20% of their capital from 
the American company Qwest Communications International.

It is not strange to see Japanese companies cooperating with competitors.  
Joint ventures with Western companies are still rare, but less so recently, 
given the longevity of the economic malaise in Japan, and the severe 
profitability and balance sheet problems of some Japanese companies.  
Nevertheless, as far as I know, this is the first time that power companies 
have made such an effort.  In the past, they have generally maintained 
mutually respectful local monopolies.  I think that deregulation has them 
very worried.  I imagine that they will continue with this cooperation as 
they feel more and more threatened by Enron and other Western companies.


Eugenio

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no "Chicago Book" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the "envelope" which you mention, which appears to be a 
delegated trading authority, in which case we are back to "square one" it 
would appear.

Help me out.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Subject: Re: Authorised Traders : Montreal & Chicago  

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Sally,

Attached is the final results from the meeting today.  These results DO NOT 
include the Analyst and Associates.  The spreadsheet contains an overall 
picture of the meeting today and a breakdown by organization (EOPS, EGM, 
EIM).  There are also four charts which display the overall meeting and the 
breakdowns as well.  I have sent a copy to Bob Hall which DOES NOT include 
the VP rankings.  Please let me know if you need any other data.  Great 
meeting today!  Have a wonderful weekend.

Anne Marie

Rick Buy informed us this morning that the BOD approved, effective today, a 
one week extension of the Temporary VaR allocation of $5MM to UK Power that 
was made last week in the e-mail referenced below.  So the limit changes as 
of 12/12/00 for Enron Europe:
  
   through 12/22/00 12/23/00 - 12/31/00 1/1/01
1) UK Power VaR $20.3MM  $15.3MM  $13.95MM
     UK Power NOP 68 Twh   68 Twh   59.5 Twh

If UK Power feels they need a VaR limit in excess of the schedule above, they 
will need to meet with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy to discuss it further.  
Currently, we have no Discretionary VaR available for allocation, but 
re-allocation from another commodity group may be technically possible at 
some point.  Although
several other commodity groups are vying for the same VaR capital.

2) European Gas - NOP and Maturity/Gap Limits revert to permanent limits on 
1/1/01 (as previously scheduled),  of 60 Bcf and 90 Bcf, respectively

3) Credit Trading - now includes the Debt Trading commodity group, and has 
one combined limit structure:
  NOP                  Maturity/Gap  VaR 
 $750,000 DV01/bp total        N/A   $5 MM
 $  50,000 DV01/bp individual


4) Commodity Group Loss Notification requirements were changed as follows 
(note: business units are encouraged to establish sub-limits):
      Effective 12/12/00  Previous
Daily Loss in any Commodity group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 100% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to Enron Corp. President   125% of VaR   50% of VaR
? Report to Enron Corp. Chairman   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to Audit Committee   no reporting at commodity  all are reported 
quarterly
group level   

Cumulative 5-day Loss in any Commodity Group or Portfolio:

? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 125% of VaR   not 
specifically stated
? Report to Enron Corp. President   150% of VaR    75% of VaR
? Report to Enron Corp. Chairman   175% of VaR    100% of VaR
? Report to Audit Committee   no reporting at commodity  all are reported 
quarterly
group level

Please share with whoever else needs to know, the change in loss notification 
requirements as these are applicable to all commodity groups.

Cassandra Schultz.

Rudi,

Below is ETS Risk Management Policy, which we would like Corporate to review 
before it is presented to management for approval and limit establishment.  I 
have also attached a 1st draft of the Risk Management Procedures and Controls 
that while not all are fully in place we expect them to be operational once 
transactional active increases. 

Rudi, who would be the person to check with on this policy.

Global Databases

   Pg 12 - DCAF II Project.  We talked briefly about this before.  Why is 
this project on a priority list if Commodity Logic will deliver the same

This is the response I put together for Louise.



This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.

Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic.



There are two basic alternatives:

If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in 
independence in our communication of deal data.  The "Transaction Store" does 
this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide 
this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be 
supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic 
to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the 
integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The 
systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: 
Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.  
Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support 
for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; 
the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-branded 
site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the 
question: "What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to 
competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?"
I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so 
this week to get feedback for finalization.

If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then 
certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should 
not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may 
occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, 
Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the 
data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with 
other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open 
Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two 
different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic 
functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to 
support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The 
technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and 
performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still 
probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate 
messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to 
subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.

Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and 
priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity 
Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to 
maintain arms-length independence. 

Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a 
combined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems and 
back-office services to Enron and other industry players.  I think this may 
be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of 
Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems 
should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on 
coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as 
the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity 
Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron.

Let me know your thoughts.

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

Regards,

Brent

The following is a summary of our findings for selecting a Risk System for 
the ETS Marketing Department.  Meetings were held with Richard Burchfield, 
Stephen Stock and Steve Nat to review the TAGG, ERMS and EnPower systems as 
possible alternatives for a risk system for ETS.  Lee Ferrell and Vernon 
Mercaldo represented the ETS commerical group.   In summary,  ETS is looking 
for a risk system that is fully integrated from Deal Capture to Billing and 
can be implemented in the 30-60 day timeframe.  They are anticipating maximum 
concurrent users of about 10 with approximately 20 deals per month.  Overall, 
it looks like the Caminus package offers ETS a faster and smoother 
implementation, does not expose us to any market affiliate violations or 
suspicions and is reasonably affordable with an estimated on-going 
maintenance costs of less than $100,000/year.  The following provides more 
details and I have attached a functional comparison.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions or further followup that I need to address.  Thanks.

Summary of Findings
Based on our discussion with Richard Burchfield and Stephen Stock, we 
rejected the possibility of using TAGG and ERMS because these applications 
are not able to handle spread options (one of the key ETS requirements).   
Richard suggested we take a look at EnPower.  This system was considered a 
closer fit and also more portable.  After closer inspection,  the EnPower 
System is not currently a  fully integrated product.  There are plans to 
integrate several of components into the product, but at this time, the 
system has interfaces to several other external applications including the 
following:

 RAC for Risk Management
 DECAF for deal confirmations
 PORTCALC/TAGG/ERMS for loading price curves and price calculations
 UNIFY for billing
 Desktop Models for Settlement
 Global Counterparty for Trading Partner and Credit

All of the above applications would have to be certified by an outside party 
to make sure that we could protect all parties regarding Market Affiliates.  
This would entail evaluating each system's current security, testing and 
possibly requiring changes to meet security requirements.  This process could 
take a significant amount of time to complete and might still constitute a 
violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the 
appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  We discussed this alternative 
with Drew Fossum, NNG Legal Counsel, and Drew is in concurrence with this 
opinion.  

Regarding costs, the IT team did not attempt to estimate an on-going support 
costs figure since there would be several factors to consider.  Additionally, 
there is a concern regarding how the Pipelines would achieve priority on 
getting their production problems and enhancements addressed considering the 
current demands on IT resources.

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

I discussed this with John Lavorato who is now responsible for this.  He said 
don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production. 

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548
Martha Stevens  MSteven x3-4742

Jana Morse  JMorse  x6-8265

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Sally--

I'm pretty sure that I saw your name on my calendar sometime this week to 
talk about Glenn Surowiec, but then it disappeared.  I would be happy to let 
you know how he's done (he was pre-ranked in Superior at EBS, so I imagine 
you're going to need some ammunition.)  Since I will be in the meeting as 
well, I can speak up when details need to get hashed out.  If I mistakenly 
missed our appointment, I apologize.  Let me know if I can help.

See you Wednesday...

Dear Sally,

We have been preparing this information daily.  Until the end of the year, 
either Nancy or I will send it to you.  The full blown exception reporting 
will start the first week of January, including elevation of issues (so you 
won't get it every day anymore) when Christy starts.  I also have a 
contractor currently developing an Access database to capture all exception 
reporting info.

For the past few days, I have been hoping to spend time following up on the 
issues, not only in the deal capture arena, but in all reporting. Once the 
markets calm down, I'll be able to do so.

Best regards

Shona

Subject: 

Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to 
fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current "hot" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic "blocking & tackling" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA
Pat Cagney  EES

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project 
Sunrise.  The ultimate success of these efforts depends on all of us working 
together to learn to fully utilize and optimize the new tools we have 
available to us.  Thanks again for all your help.

Subject: Enron Raptor I P&L Reversal

 On the 11/13/00 MPR, we will be offsetting $163,337,947 of YTD P&L loss 
associated with the Raptor I hedge.  This P&L has been accumulating since 
Project Raptor was created using 8/3/00 asset balances.  On the MPR, we have 
been showing the daily marking of the Raptor assets to the screen but have 
not been showing the corresponding hedge offset.  The amounts have been 
flashed by ENA with the hedge offset included.

 This change will show up on the 11/13/00 DPR.

 If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact either Susie 
Ayala at x3-0524 or myself at x3-6983 by 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, 11/14/00.

 Thank you,
 David Maxwell

Financial Management Module 2.0
Financial Invoice Exchange 1.1
Confirm Central 1.0
Contract Exchange 1.0

Please let us know if you are interested in attending.

All the best,

Sally

I would welcome the opportunity to walk you through these presentations if 
you have time. It has been 6 weeks - 2 months since we did an integration 
update for Rick and hopefully this will demonstrate that we are out of 
integration and managing more in the line as if it was any other business - 
with it's usual set of problems.

I am also using this report to update Joe Gold who has been moved by the 
office of the chair to President of the EnronMetals Group 

Hope all is well

Please find attached two presentations on current position/challenges with 
the Metals group and inventory balances in particular. 

The former outlines the 'Control' view of integration efforts - past, current 
and urgent future
The latter is a summarised response to your earlier concerns over inventory 

I look forward to discussing these with you at 9.30am / 15.30 pm ( London ).

Steve Stock has kindly volunteered to give us an overview of the current 
work-in-progress across Enron's technology group - I figured this would be a 
good first step in establishing the nature of the current medium term IT 
strategy.

Likely to be next week some time.

 On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
$56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.

 Please call me at x3-6983 with questions.

I discussed with Ted and David, and they agree with Oliver's analysis below, 
so Chris, let's go ahead and report on the $20MM loss against UK Gas in 
today's notifications.  Then perhaps you can work with James to adjust DPR 
reporting accordingly going forward.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Loss Notification - "Structured Derivatives"  

Cassandra

As discussed with Ted, David and yourself the loss should not be looked at on 
its own as it is due to movements in two markets.

The UK power price curve shifted and the UK gas volatility curve shifted. The 
P+L break out is as follows:

UK Power delta P+L      $38MM
Spread options (Structured derivatives) gamma P+L  $(20)MM
Spread options (Structured derivatives) vega P+L  $(23)MM
UK Gas  vega P+L      $4MM

If prudency releases are stripped out I think if we allocate P+L to the 
correct books we get the following total P+Ls exluding reserve releases:

UK Power       $18MM
UK Gas        $(20)MM (Excludes reserve release of $17MM)

Therefore we only have a loss violation in UK gas. This is not trying to 
avoid the $42MM loss notification, I am only trying to represent the loss 
that reflects the true risk in the books of Europe.

Please hold off on the issue of a notification until it is decided that only 
a loss notification is issued for gas.

Rgds

Oliver

Subject: Loss Notification - "Structured Derivatives"

Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options 
should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the 
Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and 
VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported 
separately in "Structured Derivatives".  This reporting is perhaps further 
complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European 
Gas.  

The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver 
indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option 
position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, 
regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the 
$15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.

Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay 
and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price 
curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.

Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial 
team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L 
and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate 
in compliance with the policy.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

I agree.   I spoke with Terrie Wheeler and Shawn Kilchrist about this and 
they agreed.  

If a payment is $1 million or greater and is supported by a contract, we only 
require an Accounting Director's signature.  A copy of the contract can be 
attached as support or you can write on the request that the "Payment request 
is supported by and has been reviewed against an approved contract".  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Larry

Larry,

The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls 
sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a 
vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items 
fall under category "B" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email 
below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting 
Director.

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to 
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with 
them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts 
signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from 
the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.

I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate 
the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow 
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec. 
11.  Thank you.

        Greg x35399

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

First of all I want to thank you and David for the two Orange Bowl tickets.  
It has been a wonderful season for the Sooners and it is certainly one I will
not soon forget.  I am very excited about the chance to play for our seventh 
National Championship,  **(Texas has three, just in case you were 
wondering)**,
but enough of that Texas-OU, excuse me OU-Texas trash-talking.  Due to 
various reasons, I have decided not to make the trip to Miami.  None of my 
friends
were going to be able to make it and it would have delayed some of my 
financial plans for the upcoming year.   I will nonetheless be there in 
spirit as I 
raise the roof at Ruggles in Enron Field, site of the OU watch party.  I 
believe that Nate Blackburn and Rafael Avila plan to make the trip and our 
still looking for tickets.  I have not mentioned your tickets as I thought 
you may have someone else in mind.  If by some stretch of the imagination you 
have trouble finding takers for the tickets please let me know.  Once again 
thanks for the offer and I hope you and David have a great time in Miami.

Jody

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

Check out this website.  http://www.thomsonesg.com/index.htm.

This is a company that ConfirmCorp is talking with regarding some type of 
relationship to improve ConfirmCorp's financial viability/stability.

Either they will form some type of legal venture together or Thomson execs 
may sit on the board of ConfirmCorp.

Shona,

Could you or someone in your group provide us with a summary of the last 
month's issues? It would be helpful to see trends in order to to track 
improvements. and to get an overall feel for where we should focus our 
efforts. 

If you agree, let's just plan to have the summary for next week's meeting 
with Rick and Sally.

Thanks,

Debbie

a summary and I will prepare one for you.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use "WSCC", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the "Re:" say "Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000"
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella 
in Public Relations.  The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark 
Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Global Markets be 
responsive  when we are asked for information from our business units.  
Please pass along to Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your 
group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly 
newsletter.  Kathie has assured me that the person providing the information 
is not required to do the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she 
will then prepare in paragraph form.  Michelle will send a reminder message 
to the contact person when the updates are needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

As Enron finalizes plans for our child care center scheduled to open during 
the 3rd quarter of next year, we would like your input on 3-5 alternatives 
for names for our center. We will be holding open forum type focus groups on:

December 11th and 12th in room EB49C3 from 11 am to 1 pm.


If your schedule allows, we would love to have you stop by and provide your 
feedback.  

Thanks for your assistance in naming our center! We look forward to seeing 
you next week!

Regards,

Charla

Scott

With all our reporting changing to London Office and now it appears some 
restructure of risk and the broadening of Sally's role, what are we going to 
do for the second report for our new risk manager, Justin Den Hertog - he has 
taken over from Alan.

He reports to me locally, but functionally he would traditionally have 
reported to you on behalf of Sally's area. I assume this has now moved with 
the rest of us and would therefore be either James New or Mike Jordan in 
London? Can you please advise me via return email as we are working on our 
PEP stuff, reviews etc.

With thanks

Heidi

In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of=

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo=

Sally, 

Thanks for your message this morning.  Attached is an E-mail that Amy Gambill 
sent out along with Todd's resume.  I was a little worried about forwarding 
Todd's resume directly to Shona since her husband is an ERM/Audit manager at 
KPMG.  Todd wants to make sure that noone at KPMG finds out that he is 
interested in Enron.  I thought it would be better if you forwarded his 
resume to Shona along with a note insuring that  this is keep quiet.  Please 
feel free to call me with any questions about Todd and thanks again for your 
help.  I honestly believe that Todd is a top performer at KPMG and would make 
a great addition to your team.

Thanks,

John

Hi guys!

This is an employee referral which came to me from John Mackel in EES.  I've 
spoken with Todd, and though he is happy in his position with KPMG and not 
actively seeking other opportunities, he would not mind exploring 
opportunities at Enron should a good fit for his skills come up (John's been 
telling him wonderful things about Enron).  He would be particularly 
interested in a trading analyst/P&L/mid office type position.  John had 
mentioned Sally Beck's world to me and Todd mentioned the same.

If any of you do have anything in mind, please let me know.  Should any of 
you consider contacting Todd, it might be best to contact him at home.  Since 
he is happy with his current employer, he was really concerned with 
confidentiality when we spoke.  I assured him that you guys always handle 
contacting prospective candidates with a great deal of respect for their 
privacy.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Todd.  If any of you guys have openings 
which may fit his skill set, I think he'd really be worth giving a call.

Thanks!
Amy

These guys are using the technology we saw last week from OnExchange.  Amerex 
called me today to ask us to participate or (if we deemed it necessary) to 
take the lead in this project.  As always, James has the competitor info 
database on this stuff.  Please copy him on all material like this.

All the best,

Sounds like this .com will be a direct competitor for FIX and maybe even 
FMM.   We need to watch for more details.

Sally,

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about 
getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources?  
Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those 
resources on GCP?

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Please help!!!

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Now that we have implemented SAP, the BUs have come together to form teams to 
fill the gaps and explore opportunities to make more efficient use of SAP in 
the areas of Financial, Human Resources and Global Sourcing.  Melissa Becker 
will coordinate the efforts of the various teams.

The Financial teams, including process leveraging (with Jan Johnson as lead) 
and reporting (led by Mark Frank), will be working together over the next 6 
to 12 months since their objectives touch or overlap in many areas.  
Together, this effort is Project Sunrise.  The teams will be gathering 
information from accounting personnel in each BU about key information needs 
and key processes, to identify opportunities that would benefit all BUs as 
well as to identify BU-specific opportunities that the BUs may wish to pursue.

The teams' objectives are to work with the BUs to:

1. Create better, more user-friendly reporting capabilities
A. Implement short term measures to address current "hot" reporting issues 
(e.g., labor distribution and project management) (Susan Bellinghausen is 
spearheading this effort.)
B. Develop and implement medium term measures to improve access to 
information (e.g., data warehouse with web-based access)
C. Develop and implement longer term web-based tool addressing 4 key areas 
(costs, P&L, counterparties and cash)
2. Improve processes to provide better quality, more timely information
A. Implement process changes required to execute reporting objectives
B. Shorten close process
C. Improve basic "blocking & tackling" related to controls 
D. Share best practices among BUs

Representatives from the BUs working on these two teams will be:

Steve Thatcher  ENA
Caroline Lothian Europe
Joe Darensbourg International regions
Howard Selzer  International regions
Steve Frazier  EES
Madeline Chan  EBS
Dave Wittenburg ETS
Jill Erwin  Corp Acctg and EGF

The following are subject matter experts (SMEs) in various BUs and functional 
groups who will spend varying amounts of their time in addressing specific 
issues.

James Weitekamp ETS (planning)
Sayed Khoja  EGM 
Allen Ueckert  International regions (project systems)
Glenn Kobes  Tax
Brandee Sanborn ISC

We will continue to identify others who will share their expertise.

The following people will be working specifically on data warehouse and 
web-based reporting initiatives:

Beverly Fennesey ISC 
Li Chan   ENA

The teams will begin by interviewing persons identified by the CAO of each 
BU, to determine their information needs and to review their processes, while 
continuing to develop the data warehouse and creating the web-based reporting 
tool.  The efforts of the process leveraging and reporting teams are vital to 
our being able to quickly obtain key information to run our businesses.  I 
appreciate all of your efforts to date with regard to SAP and now, Project 
Sunrise.  The ultimate success of these efforts depends on all of us working 
together to learn to fully utilize and optimize the new tools we have 
available to us.  Thanks again for all your help.

take the lead in this project.  As always, James has the competitor info

Sounds like this .com will be a direct competitor for FIX and maybe even

I wasn't wanting to bother you with this as I was handling w/Jordan and co., 
but given our later issue re: the UK positions and Skilling's request for 
component VaR for Agg Enron   (Ted's call to you just know), I'm forwarding 
after all.

Subject: Loss Notification - "Structured Derivatives"

Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options 
should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the 
Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and 
VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported 
separately in "Structured Derivatives".  This reporting is perhaps further 
complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European 
Gas.  

The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver 
indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option 
position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, 
regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the 
$15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.

Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay 
and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price 
curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.

Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial 
team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L 
and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate 
in compliance with the policy.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Larry,

The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls 
sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a 
vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items 
fall under category "B" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email 
below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting 
Director.

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to 
provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with 
them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts 
signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from 
the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.

I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate 
the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow 
to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec. 
11.  Thank you.

        Greg x35399

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Changes to the Report Starting this Week:

-   The Financial Desk in North American Gas only shows values without 
exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has already increased its overall average daily EOL

approximately 4,040 trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being 
traded on EOL.

*  The Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its average daily 
EOL deal count by about 45% since October, from 494 to 714 deals per day in 
November.  In December, the average daily EOL deal count is up another 60%, 
from 714 to 1,141 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume 
has increased significantly as well.

* US Power has increased its average daily EOL volume by 100% since 
November.  The average daily EOL Deal Count has increased slightly as well.

*  Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast Power has increased its average daily 
EOL volume by about 100% since November.  In addition, the average daily EOL 
deal count for these Power regions has increased by about 50% since November. 

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 23% of the total 
in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only about 33% of 
the total in October.

*   LPG's has steadily increased its total monthly EOL deal count from 281 in 
September, 398 in October, 444 in November, to 181 deals already in 
December.  The total monthly EOL volume has increased similarly as well.

from a level of about 400 in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for 
November has decreased similarly as well.

*  Heating Oil Financial has had few, if any, NYMEX look-a-like trades on EOL 
over the past few months.  Out of a total of about 1,200 trades in November, 
less than 40 have been done on EOL.  Heating Oil Physical has yet to do a 
trade on EOL.

October.  The total monthly EOL deal count for November was only about 24% of 
the total in October.  The total monthly EOL volume for November was only

Sally,

I wondered if we needed to extend the special floor support schedule or if we 
needed to make it be an ongoing schedule of floor support. Please advise.

Thanks

Subject: Re: ERMS/TAGG floor support  

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Zhiyong

Dear Managers & Supervisors, 
Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC 
process.    It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions 
that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you 
supervise.    Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their 
feedback verbally and in written form. 
I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses 
and merit increases are given on 2/5/01.

Please remember:

 All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance 
evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to 
the employee.    
Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees. 
HR will participate as observers of some reviews. 

Let us know how we can assist you,
Your HR Team

Attached is a copy of the Deal Approval Sheet (DASH) that is to be used as 
part of the transaction approval process within EGM and a copy of the 
transaction approval requirements.

All transactions (capital expenditures or risk adjusted capital) in excess of 
$500,000 must have a completed DASH and sign off by the following groups:
o applicable EGM business unit management
o EGM Office of the Chairman
o Legal
o RAC
o EGM Operations
o Enron Capital Management
o appropriate level of Enron Corp. management (if required, see attached)  

Capital expenditures include any acquisitions/divestitures of assets, 
offerings of debt, subordinated debt, equity or partnership capital or 
entering into a commodity or financial position that results in an exposure 
outside of Board approved limits.  Capital expenditure amounts embedded in a 
commodity price to a counterparty should be analyzed separately for DASH 
purposes and authorized by the appropriate entity.

Please contact me at ext. 37647 or Bjorn Hagelmann (RAC) at ext. 57984 if y0u 
have any questions or need assistance with the process.

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks

Changes to the Report Starting this Week:

-  The Gas Daily East and the East Graphs have been combined to just East.

-   The ENA Canada East and Central Graphs have been combined to just Central.

-   The NG Price Book is now named Financial Desk and shows values with and 
without exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has increased its overall average daily EOL deal count 
by over 1,000 trades a day since October.  There are now approximately 3,100 
trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The newly combined East Region in North American Gas has approximately 
doubled its average daily EOL deal count and average daily EOL volume since 
October.

*  The newly combined Central Region in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 38% since October, from 498 to 685 deals 
per day.   However, the average daily EOL volume has remained steady since 
October.

*  The newly named Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 41% since October, from 494 to 698 deals 
per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has increased about 25% 
since October.

32% since October.  The average daily EOL volume for California Power has 
more than doubled since October.

since October.  However, the average daily EOL deal count for Midwest Power 
has remained steady since October.

*  Southeast Power has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by over 51% 
since October.  The average daily EOL volume for Southeast Power has 
decreased significantly as well.  However, these are approximately the levels 
we had seen in prior months before October. 

*  UK Power has more than doubled its average daily EOL deal count since 
October from 8 deals to over 15 deals.  The average daily EOL volume has  
remained fairly level.

*  Nordic Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count about 45% 
since October, from 20 to 29 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily 
EOL volume has increased about 25% since October.

*  US Weather has steadily decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a 
high in June of 241 deals to recent low of only 25 deals.  However, there has 
been a slight increase in November to 31 EOL US Weather deals with one more 
day to go..  

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 85% since 
October, from a daily average of 150 to a daily average of 280 for November.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November stands now at only about 21% of 
the total in October with only one more day to go.

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use "WSCC", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the "Re:" say "Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000"
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Shona -
RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in 
understanding the violations.  I recognize and sympathize with the strain 
your group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, the 
increased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestions 
were: 1) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data 
gathering process easier, 2) I was offering to "be the bad guy" and point out 
to the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of 
increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their 
accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.

I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being "validated" by 
the traders as you indicated below, vs. "provided" by the traders as we 
envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing 
the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back 
to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders 
should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you 
do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track 
people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders 
responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their 
positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able 
to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.  
Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they 
talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you 
- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to 
manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and 
is still effective from a risk management stand point.

At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to 
face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team 
players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way 
the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and 
appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the 
policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the 
time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.  

Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk 
about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's 
expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have 
been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;  
and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk 
reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on 
streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our 
respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do 
whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what 
either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that 
Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of 
activities related to our risk management systems.


Best Regards,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Limit Violations and Notifications Process  

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Currently, I am receiving exception reporting from many of your groups in

In order to make the reporting easy on you we would like to build the 
database around your current systems.  In order to do this, you and people in 
your groups will be receiving calls from Kelly Tisman, who is responsible for 
building the database.  Please make some time to show her your systems and 
needs as far as the reporting is concerned.

Attached is the list of people she is planning to contact.  If it needs

Last week y'all asked us to follow up with several key individuals within the 
ENA group to see how it's going with SAP.  We were not to give any "hints"; 
just ask some open-ended (but probing) questions.  I'm attaching all the 
responses (Georgeann directed us to Greg W ).  I don't see anything alarming 
or red-hot -- I just hope they were being totally candid and honest with 
us!!  Overall I would categorize them as normal support issues around the 
areas of needing some spot "1-on-1" training for users, more experience in 
overall information retrieval, editing of some reports, our security process 
and the difficulty of getting information from various and sundry databases 
(since SAP is interfaced) to get the full picture.

We have passed all these items on to the appropriate Solution Mgr, so that 
they can specifically address them.

As I think I mentioned several months ago we had complaints about 
nonresponsiveness (calls not being returned, being passed around alot, etc).  
Hopefully we've turned the corner there.

Please let me know if there are other areas you'd like us to address (as we 
discussed), otherwise we will continue to try to keep our finger on the 
pulse.  And please let me know who our contact person from ENA should be.


Thanks,

KK

Subject: ENA Summary

Kathy,

Please find the highlights below from my ENA customer meetings:

Bryce Baxter

Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Small issues voiced by Bryce, not strong sources of contention :
Feels the response time does not happen with 'lightning speed', but works 
fine once they agree to a deadline with Pamela LeBrane
Zcash specification changes delayed due to errors identified by both groups, 
but they are still moving forward
Payment runs are generated early on occassion and it is tough to cancel a 
payment (they are blocking all payments now to avoid this issue)
Unify to SAP interface - files are not being picked up at least once a week 
(certain files 'drop off'); Mary Tyler Marz (ENA) and Teresa Mira (ISC) are 
working on this issue 

Leslie Reeves
Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Areas Leslie would like assistance from the ISC:
Further editing on reports; understanding what information is available and 
how they can extract the information from SAP
Further training (coaching sessions) by members of the ISC Solution Teams to 
help with the following areas:
How to pull data from SAP (data mining)
Explanation of how to find all the pieces required to complete their monthly 
reconciliation process (balancing cost centers, reconciling the P&L to the G/L
Explanation of the interface reconciliation process for financial out of 
balances
Explanation of the steps required for new accounts, business areas, cost 
centers, allocation process (needs to fully understand the process in SAP)
Follow up with Debbie Brackett in Credit to determine if she is receiving the 
credit information from SAP in a timely manner
I told Leslie that I would follow up with Susan B. and Brandee and ask them 
to call her directly.  Leslie would like to meet with each of them and then 
determine the correct individuals on her team to become involved in the 
process.

Both Bryce and Leslie were very appreciative of the customer focused 
attention from the ISC.  They both thought it was great that we scheduled 
time to visit with them and understand their questions/issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary

Subject: Feedback for the ISC

Greg,

Thank you for taking time to meet with me today about the ISC and SAP.  I 
appreciated your explanations and your feedback.  Please see if I have 
captured the main points below.  If so, no need to reply.  If not, please 
provide corrections or elaborations.  

I will talk with Sheila and Brandee about the best course of action to get 
Laura Scott's feedback about the issues in Canada.  I'll also check on the 
status of Hyperion.

I passed along your comments about Michael Gilmore to both Michael and his 
manager Vince Cacaro.  Both were pleased to receive positive customer 
feedback.

Regards,
Rebecca

----------------------

ENA's (Financial) SAP "Wish List"

Earlier inter-company cutoffs in month-end close, to facilitate the overall 
close process.
Clarity around the status of Hyperion -- will it be here beyond the end of 
the year?  If so, will the process for mapping between FI/CO and Hyperion be 
addressed?
Getting all the information for our customers into the same repository.  Brio 
should be the answer to many of our issues, as it should ultimately integrate 
data from the Tag database (ERMS), Empower, Unify, CPI, and Solark.  
A different type or level of support during month-end close, at least through 
1Q 2001.  In order of criticality, the issues/needs to be addressed are:
security (making sure people have the correct security and have it prior to 
month-end close)
cost center & profit center set-up (ultimately, centralized set-up is the 
right thing, but the process during close needs work)
reporting (quicker/better access to the right data post close)

Enron Transportation Services (ETS) is looking to expand the use of 
structured products both from a physical and financial perspective. To 
support these initiatives ETS needs a trading/risk management system.   The 
attached Statement of Work overviews our current and proposed business 
environments.  We have looked at the possibility of utilizing an internal 
Enron trading/risk management system, but to date have not been able to find 
a feasible alternative.  Portability, security, and functionality have been 
the major hurdles.  After further discussions it was suggested a 
communication be sent to each of you to see if you could shed further light 
on this subject, with the potential of using a preexisting Enron system.

If we are unable to find an internal system we will look to purchase the 
Caminus package.  As a trading/risk management system is seen as a critical 
step in meeting future revenue targets we will be making a final decision on 
a trading/risk management system for ETS in the next two weeks.

If you have any comments of suggestions please forward them to Lee Ferrell 
(x35197).

Thank you.

Sally, Brent and Gary,

In a meeting with Bryan, Jeff, Gary and Markus on Monday, November 20th, I 
showed Bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book 
administrator's Price Verification Comparison Spreadsheet .  I also showed 
Brent this information later in the day, as he had to leave before we all 
left.

Therefore, I find Bryan's Operations' bullet  wrong and misleading.  This is 
not the statement that was made and agreed to on Monday when we all met.  
This statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the 
attachment.  You will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for 
the last six months on Monday.

Please call me or Theresa with questions.
Sheila

Bryan,
I think the second bullet is misleading.  The bullet is not reflective of 
what is actually stated in the attached document.
There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.  
Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is 
greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.  Trader 
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the 
illiquid position.
The Price Verifiaction Comparison Spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and 
maintained by Risk Management.

The Operations break-down in the process relates to:
 Triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not 
escalated, prioritized to management
 Telewest  pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually 
sourced and not current
 Price Verification Comparison results should be formalized and distributed 
to senior management.

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Debt Trading Losses


We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Subject: Deals booked to New Counterparty

The attached file represents deals booked to New Counterparty as of close of 
business, December 8. In order to correctly report and manage credit 
exposure, these deals need to be rebooked to reflect the actual counterparty 
on the transaction.  



 Please forward this to the appropriate person within your organization who 
can rebook the deals to the proper counterparty, or call me at X35856 if you 
have questions.

Thanks,

Debbie

This system was just implemented for ENA etal as a Global system.  We are 
working on convincing Europe to incorporate into their EnVision plan.  There 
could be potential to include this in the Commodity Logic family as a way to 
aggregate and serve time series price information to users.  A direct 
competitor of this product would be FAME Energy which I looked at earlier 
this week.  On the surface, it would appear our system is more robust than 
the one offered by FAME.

Dear All,

Please be aware that earlier today the MKM system was pushed to production. 

http://mkm.corp.enron.com

We are currently in the process of moving the system from the UK to our 
clustered servers in Houston. This early release will give us some useful 
feedback on the visual interface and help promote the MKM approach to other 
business and application development groups. I will keep you informed of our 
progess.

Any questions please call x37747.

Thanks,

Stuart

As discussed before John has asked us to send out this reminder of our 
standards - clearly as we gather the data for Shona's daily reporting we will 
discuss with the office of the chair

Cheers

John Sherriff writes.......

Enron Trading is all about a unique combination of being "tight" and 
"loose".  We give the managers of our trading books tremendous freedom 
("loose")
to make decisions on the spot and manage for profitability.  We can do this 
because we have a standard way of controlling ("tight") that is consistent
from trading book to trading book.

Summarized below are the highlights of our fundamental risk management 
standards.  These standards are an integral part of our trading discipline 
and culture and we expect all our employees both commercial and noncommercial 
to absolutely understand these control standards.  These standards will 
evolve over time (especially as we move to new electronic trading methods) 
but the basics of separation of duties and accurate reporting are at the 
cornerstone of
our business.  So please ask plenty of questions about these standards, make 
sure you understand them and let us know when we are not living up to them.  

Questions and feedback should be directed to Mike Jordan on extension 34703.



RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS IN A TRADING ENVIRONMENT

To manage operational risk in a trading environment Enron has designed and 
implemented operational control standards. These standards, which are common 
for all businesses, aim to prevent errors and inaccuracies and ensure the 
timely recording of trading transactions. 

What standards does Enron have in place?

Enron has six fundamental standards for risk management that cover:
- Recording transactions
- Reporting daily profit & loss and risk positions
- Confirmation and execution of transactions
- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the general 
ledger
- Implementation of business and control infrastructure

What else is important when controls are implemented?

Implementing segregation of duties within the trading environment ensures 
that no individual has control over all phases of a transaction.   This 
allows incompatible functional responsibilities to be kept separate, 
specifically:
- Authorization and execution of transactions
- Recording and performance of transactions
- Monitoring and review of trading activities 

Why do we need to standardised controls?

To assimilate new or build existing commodity businesses Enron needs to be 
nimble and responsive. A robust and stable control process can be duplicated 
or flexed quickly and confidently, providing scalability and the capability 
to assess and manage operational risk.

How do we measure successful control?

By identifying and reporting metrics for all standards we build an 
understanding of compliance across all businesses and seek continual 
improvement. This compliments the qualitative cross-checking process 
facilitated by communication between Commercial, Risk Management Operations 
and RAC.

The control measurement process will be part of a global initiative across 
all commodities and locations.

Where can you find details of our fundamental standards?
