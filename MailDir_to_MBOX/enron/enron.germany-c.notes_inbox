I am working with the EOL system development group on improving the reporting 
capabilities of EOL so that Internal EOL traders can personalised and save 
report formats.  Currently the system only saves the last report format.  If 
you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The 
goal would be to give you the ability to view the information when you need 
it and in the required format.

Subject: Dominion Transmission Gathering Charges

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG 
Transmission)  announced that they have reached a five year agreement on 
gathering rates.  Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval, 
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001.  Under the agreement, 
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for 
gathering or processing.  Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention 
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing.  They are:

                                                       1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003   
                 7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry                                       
0                                                          0
Transmission Wet                                  
3.91%                                                  3.51%
Gathering Dry                                           
9.34%                                                   9.34%
Gathering Wet                                          
13.25%                                               12.85%           

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate  the 
production information to the producer and/or his agent.  My guess is that 
they will send a  monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each 
meter.  The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter 
(a gross volume) .  This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage 
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or 
processing).  The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer 
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing.  There will be no 
additional charges.  ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

John

Subject: Volunteer

I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New 
Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  

Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more 
about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.



I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 
4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 
4/1/2001.

Pros
Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing 
guru like myself.
Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over 
until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. 
Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)
Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the 
desk P&L.



Cons
Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.  
I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm 
very detail oriented.
I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the 
job very serious.

Subject: CGAS deal 213360

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

Subject: CGAS deal 213360

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Terry - Dominion is still showing activity for 8G0A61 and 8T1064 this month.  
But the
imbalance is transferred to ENA contracts.

 Under section four it shows where we cashed Account 6&7 to pay Mary.  It 
shows
entire balance but we only paid out $40,000.


Next question, we moved the money out of Dad's IRA's prior to death,  so we do
not have to show this right.

Kathy,  If I remember this correctly,  this is gas purchased by John Singer 
behind the citygate that CES actually nommed directly.  We simply put the 
deals into the system as buy/sells.  I talked to Chris and he said that B & B 
will have the paper you need.  I hope this helps.Victor

The deal 226556 with volume of 4991 was billed and paid separately.  Volume 
was supposed to be 5000  (B&B still wants the 9 difference).  I just talked 
to John Singer and he is checking with B&B and with  National Fuel Gas for 
some paper.  He also indicated that this citygate gas was nommed into CES's 
pool.  If so, someone should be billing CES for it .


WRP










Victor and Robert, 
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one.  The only deal with 
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have 
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in 
navigator.  The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is 
showing a zero volume in unify.  

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but 
with different prices.  The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume 
of 4991.  Is  possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal 
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kathy

Subject: Belden & Blake May-00 NFGD PA Invoice

 Volume Management (Angel Fuller), has been unable to locate any volumes for 
Belden & Blake for May-00 NFGD PA (National Fuel Gas) gas under Columbia Gas 
Transmission.  She researched her actuals and looked on Columbia Navigator 
under ENA and NFGD PA  and was unable to find volumes as invoiced. B&B is 
invoicing for 1302 mcf.  The Sitara deal that was used for March used CGAS 
Point  21 NYSEG  02 Constrained Citygate and has pricing of $3.30 as per the 
invoice. 

Can you give us any more clues as to where we might find this gas?  Some 
place else on Navigator? Can B&B supply us with some kind of statement?

Please let me know.

Thanks  WRP

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

I'm off to Paris tomorrow until the 29th.  Please feel free to call Greg 
Maliken in my absence 716-857- 7634 and check the website for daily 
postings.  I can't promise that this email will be daily.

I have 10,000 dth available for ISS on the east side of my system and 25,000 
available at Colden (which requires Tenn Zone 5 capacity).  I'm not sure what 
the weekend is looking like but Greg should be able to tell you tomorrow 
morning.

Transportation paths are open and I can move 100,000 dth on my Niagara to 
Leidy line today, tomorrow, into the foreseeable future!

Advance is available, you're guess is as good as mine with the daily pricing 
lately.  Merrill Lynch is forecasting electric demand price spikes this 
summer , while Salomon Smith Barney sees near time pricing "subsiding."

Au revoir,
Abigail

Chris,
 Just to confirm with you about activity with Egan Hub, there was nothing for 
September production, however there was a park and loan deal for October.  If 
this is correct, could you please forward you spreadsheet with the details?  
I have not received anything from Egan confirming this or billing me for any 
fees associated with this deal.   Also, just to let you be aware of the 
imbalance left on the other storage activity that was bought from Columbia; 
we had an ending imbalance of 101 mmbtu due ENA.  If you need a copy of the 
Egan statement with this, please let me know, so I can forward a copy to you 
or whomever may need it.

Thanks,
Marlo

Chris ---

We agreed to a capacity release deal with Tim Landstrom at Indeck Silver 
Springs.  Indeck will release non-recallable capacity to ENA for $0.10/dt.

 Term:  December 1-31, 2000
 Receipt: Hastings Agg
 Delivery: Silver Springs facility (North citygate)
 Rate:  $0.10 demand
 Volume: 9,549 dt delivered (9,772 @ SP)

According to Tim, he's never had problems taking this to any north citygates 
except NIMO East.  But, it is secondary.  Mr. Goodell has volunteered to 
handle the release, but I wanted you to know about it.  We also bought 9,772 
dt at South Point for December.

Scott

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.
Victor

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type

60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

CES was billed $1,597,000 in demand reimbursement for 6/00 prod.  Can you 
split this amount between East and MktEast?

Thanks!

It's not a short pay that I am concerned with.  They are a netout customer.  
They only billed us for  $2,717,153.94. We show that we owe them 
$5,479,867.12.  I thought that you were checking on a buy/sale that was 
supposed to cancel off some of this payable amount.  They paid us 
$17,705,483.84, which is the net of what they owed us and what they think we 
owed them.

Call if that doesn't make sense.

Do you have a total dollar amount that New Power paid for Oct production?  
According to David Scott at New Power, they did not make any adjustments to 
the bill.  He said they may not have received all of the bill, there might 
have been some Michcon activity missing.

I need to get from you a detailed list of contracts on TCO that have been 
assigned to ENA from either CES or NPC. Specifically I am looking for RPs, 
DPs and the associated primary volumes. The monthly contract list tracks 
demand charges OK, but is not good enough for pathing gas in Winter. Give me 
a call when you get back to discuss.

Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually "rubber-stamped" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  
http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Re:  Texas Gas Rate Changes Effective 1/1/01

On November 30, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-
135-000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement in Docket No.
RP97-344, in which the Commission required Texas Gas to
reduce certain Account No. 858 contracts.  In the instant
filing Texas Gas proposes to reflect rate reductions
resulting from the termination of the HIOS T-17 contract.
Included in the filing were revised rates under Texas Gas'
Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render service to
its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.  The revised
tariff sheets have a proposed effective date of January 1,
2001.  If accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas tariff
sheets would result in the following changes in Transco's
current Rate Schedule FT-NT Rates:


Zone SL Demand Charge -  $0.0192 decrease
Zone 1 Demand Charge  -  $0.0192 decrease

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

NEWS FLASH!!!!

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. Finding 
enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!
...Chuck

Is the $10,000/month scheduling fee part of the $1,193,725? Is the demand 
charge for all of the reimbursements on all pipelines combined?

Subject: New Power Demand Charge

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.

High Level Penalty Summary

Date(s) of Flow

 November 18 - 21, 2000

Contract Involved:

 38088  ENA delivered 33,250 to Hopewell on this contract for dates below.  
VNG needed volume below to balance at gate, attempted to pull    and contract 
was overrun.

  18 VNG took 29,782 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 14,002 
overrun.

  19 VNG took 44,476 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 28,696 
overrun.

  20 VNG took 37,643 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 21,863 
overrun.

  21 VNG took 56,881 from storage, result of both ENA and VNG was 18,876 
overrun
   ______

 Total Overrun: 83,437 @ $0.1992 =  $16,620.65

 60536  ENA delivered 11,451 back into the VNG storage as payback when VNG 
pulled all 14,625 and overran the contract.  

  21 14,306 overrun
   ______

 Total Overrun: 14,306 @ $0.1992 = $2,849.76

 TFE  Total Firm Entitlement Penalty

  18-21 97,743 @ $5.6684 = $554,050.00

   Total Overrun on both contracts and penalty due to market area 
restrictions when overrun occurred.

******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************
****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract 
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November 
20th about the overrun situation above.  The VNG gas control experienced  the 
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first 
priority.  This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating 
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum  volumes from   storage 
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery 
points.  Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the  
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day 
with no-notice contracts.  Ranking has zero effect with the late night   
schedulers.

5) Enron dropped the Hopewell nomination from the VNG contract(s) effective 
11/22.

Subject: Columbia Gas Transmission (TCO) penalties - November 2000


** High Priority **

I received a call this afternoon from the VNG - TCO Account Manager.  VNG 
incurred pipeline overrun charges from  Nov 17th - 21st.  TCO stated ENA used 
VNG capacity to deliver to other markets {Hopewell Power Plant}.  TCO 
notified Enron and VNG of the allocation problem during the month of 
November, 2000.  Although TCO assured Enron that the predetermined allocation 
methodology would be corrected to allow VNG rights to pull under the contract 
first, however, based on the conversation with TCO, corrections were not 
made.  Therefore, VNG incurred overrun charges under the VNG contract @ 
$10.00/dth totaling $560,000+.

Please notify pipeline to reconcile and provide AGLES with pipeline invoices 
for November, 2000.  ENA is responsible for all penalties associated with 
this transaction.

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

Hey Chris,

Does this amount look correct to you??  Do we actually owe New Power $5MM ?  
they haven't mentioned it to me, but it's showing up as a balance due to 
them.  could you please verify ASAP?

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

I spoke with Charles Taylor about this breakfast and he is checking with his 
assistant to 
get a head count.  The day he mentioned is Wednesday, Dec. 13th if that works 
for us.  He
will get back to me tomorrow.  Obviously, all of the schedulers won't be able 
to attend, but we
should be back in the office by 9:00, so two of you could possibly go if one 
could be here to check 
reports for that day before trading gets crazy.  

Judy, Chris, Scott -
Let me know who you want included from the customer service group.  I already 
told them to include Ingrid.

I will keep you posted.

  Beverly/Jesse, 

  Victor has mentioned that he thought it would be nice to schedule a

  We had a breakfast at TETCO this morning and it was a huge success.  

   Could you all work with Transco/Tennesee and let me know what would be a 
good morning for them?

   I will need the following...

   Date: 
   Address & Room #:
   Contact Name @ Transco/Tennessee and Phone #:  
   Setup time: (7:30am?)
   Eat time:  (8:00am?)
   Headcount:  - please include those attending from Enron. 

   Your assistance with this would be greatly appreciated, 

   Many thanks!

Columbia is taking expressions of interest in a project they are calling the 
Homestead expansion for firm (or possibly off-peak or seasonal firm) 
transportation into Operating Areas 1 and 10.  The open season will end on 
1/19/01.  The project could include Columbia working with another pipeline in 
the region, such as Transco to deliver more volumes using Transco's South 
Virginia lateral or CNG to deliver more volumes on the PL-1 line.  The 
project could include expanding Columbia's own line into Market Areas 33 and 
34 through looping or added compression.  Columbia is also considering 
building a line away from Loudoun, where LNG volumes will be delivered from 
the Cove Point pipeline, to power projects in Loudoun or Fauquier Counties in 
Virginia.  Columbia has also considered an idea in the past to build a line 
from the Cove Point terminal to BG&E through Calvert and Anne Arundel 
Counties.  Columbia indicated that they have talked with Bill Fox of 
VNG/ALG.  Columbia would like to talk with us concerning VNG, Hopewell or any 
other needs that we might have.

I ran a total on the Medicare Bills that I will be submitting to Dad's 
alternate
Insurance Co.   Most of these bills have been paid by Dow insurance so we are 
in
good shape as of $$ still owed.   Anyway when I finished compiling the list,
total was about $12,145.   I'm waiting on MD Anderson to sent me a copy of the
pathology report before I actually file.

Thought you guys might be interested to know this tad bit of info.

Sitara #418415 is a transport capacity deal for a demand charge on Transco.  
It is pointed to the IM VNG desk which we have not started using yet.  Can 
you change that to IM-East?

Bill At The Ballgame

It was the first game of the season. President Clinton and

the First Lady were invited to opening day at Yankee

Stadium. Right before the game started, the President

picked up Hillary and threw her onto the field. George

Steinbrenner turned around and shouted, "No, Mr. President,

Thanks for your help.

Hey guys,

I am starting to look a little closer at the sythetic storage and actual 
storage deals being done on the Southeast.

I am capturing the sitara deals and their pricing in order to get a better 
understanding of how sythetic and actual deals are priced differently.

I am also taking a look at how we are pathing this activity in Unify.  In 
order to avoid rework for the schedulers, I have been verifying our pathing 
procedures with Donna Greif (Unify guru) prior to pathing.

As more storage deals are done, I will be sure to distribute any new 
information to you all.

Please feel free to add any helpful hints to my spreadsheets.



Thanks
Trish

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Kathy/Scott,

I don't know exactly what Chris wanted but here's my stab at it and remember 
my limited mental abilities are making a bunch of assumptions.....

Deal 459233 is the exchange offset to 459214 and should probably be zerod 
out.  459193 is the exchange offset to 459175 and should probably be zerod 
out as well.  

Scott, 459188 and 459231 seem to be the New Power buys needed. I don't know 
which are the New Power sales needed to hook up with transport to capture 
transportation costs. Please verify...Maybe they are 377254 or 377264 or 
377268 or 454060.....

460591 is the exchange offset to Oglethorpe deal 460623.  They are totally 
different and legite and outside of this discussion.

 I hope this helps.  Let's meet and make appropriate changes quickly so 
Transco folks will have plenty of time to get changes in Unify  for the month.

Thanks

Subject: New Power Company on Transco

Hello!

Can we try to get together sometime Tuesday afternoon to discuss the New 
Power Company on Transco?  Chris Germany mentioned to me this afternoon that 
there was a New Power Company deal starting with November production on 
Transco and that it was similar to the one on Columbia Gas in that the sale 
occurs at the storage facility.  So, I decided to take a look and I can't 
swear to everything, but I believe we may need to make a few changes.  Deals 
459214 and 459175 appear to be beginning balances that have been entered as 
exchanges.  I believe that these need to be killed.  As far as I know, I 
don't believe that there is any reason for logistics to need for a beginning 
balance to come into unify.  Beginning balances are entered into unify 
manually by my group through a special screen.  We just need to know what 
that balance is before the December accounting month is closed so that we can 
upload it.  

Next, could you please get back to me with what the exchange deals of 459193 
and 460623 are?  I'm not quite sure what these exchanges were trying to 
accomplish.

What I was thinking that I would see is something similar to how we have this 
on Columbia Gas.  Perhaps Robert can help us on this.  I believe that is a 
transport contract moving to a title transfer (external pool), then a storage 
injection on the storage contract into the storage imbalance account, then 
using the point functionality to show a buy/sell at storage to the New Power 
Company.  

Anyway, let me know when you are available.  If we need to make adjustments, 
it would be best to get this done soon.

Thanks!

Kathy

CES and CEM will still exist for awhile, maybe forever due to legal issues. I 
wouldn't begin canceling anything as the Choice customers are still in CES's 
name and we don't want any capacity returning or other problems. They should 
begin to be transferred to NPC soon. Why don't you hold off for now. Larry 
Friedeman (419/878-4760) is actually the last CES employee and can be reached 
in his Toledo office through 3/31/01.

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

My house is finally ready for its first party!  Please join me for some 
cocktails, finger foods, music, and overall good spirits!

It's going to be Saturday, May 19 starting anytime after 6:00PM until Sunday 
7:30AM.  (That's when I go to church.)  May 19 is not this weekend.  It's 
next weekend.

I'll have a mix a domestic beers (including light), with some hard liquor, 
soft drinks, vegetable tray, and munchies.  (Feel free to bring any 
'specialized' booze that you may desire.)  Join in me in the fun!  Bring a 
friend.

Please RSVP so I can get an idea of how of you rapscallions will show up.  
Email me or call me at the phone numbers at the bottom.

   The start of spring

   To meet Moz and Josie, my 89-year old neighbor

Let's meet at Sullivan's just inside the 610 West loop on Westheimer at 7 PM  
because
a) It's central to the 3 Enron parties going on that night.
b) Matt and I haven't been kicked out of that place yet.
c) I can make fun of the people that are older than even me..
See you Saturday

I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well.  
I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?

We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know.
