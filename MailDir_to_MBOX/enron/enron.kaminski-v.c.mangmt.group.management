Discussions with Lance during his hire were intended to have Lance start 
prior to bonus and merit eligibility.  Therefore, Lance accepted the position 
under the impression he would be eligible for both Bonus and Merit.

Vasant-

I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered 
from the long flight back.

I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my 
intentions here at Enron.

Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged 
to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In 
addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on 
a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a 
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how 
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit 
purposes.

These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for 
which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines 
elucidating the structure of the data.

I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.

With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has 
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if 
the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been 
researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine 
will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be 
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is 
Compaq-specific.

I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.

I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not 
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the 
other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there 
wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In 
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power 
trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were 
ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they 
have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, 
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; 
during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to 
how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time 
data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with "well, we 
have it, but we haven't really tested it yet." An example is the weather: we 
still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES 
satellite.

My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only 
if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the 
Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the 
areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the 
Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people 
at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't 
directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, 
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.

As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting 
person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to 
George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are 
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their 
traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with 
Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were 
disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They 
also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid 
on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all 
work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but 
merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years 
as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a 
state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me 
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, 
including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to 
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I 
have learned here.

So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be 
a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you 
in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL 
database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their 
documentation.

As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, 
and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by 
email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data 
warehouse for floor trader support.

Clayton.

According to Alex,  Li Xiao gave your email address to Alex.  Did Li Xiao 
talk to you first about Alex? I don't know for certain.  Alex contacted you 
in March, interviewed once, but nothing came of it.  After Gary left, Li Xiao 
suggested to Alex that he try again, and the rest is history.

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

Hi, Norma

What happened to Grant? Did he leave Enron for a competetor?

I assume Vince is still interested in Anjam even though Anjam still hasn't 
agreed the offer. Please confirm as I presume Anjam is waiting until the last 
possible minute to accept.

thanks
Tara

Vince,

I am going to have the team look at the problem.   Hopefully it will be an 
easy fix.  Otherwise, we can work off the worksheets that you complete over 
the weekend.  You have my cell number if you have any questions.

Subject: Merit increases

Norma,

It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and
merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the 
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.

As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity 
raises.
The column totals are misleading.

I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).


Vince

Hello everyone:

They are:

Alexios Kollaros 502373  Now with the new Power Co.
Farouk Lalji  501609  Analyst rotated out 
Ainsley Gaddis  400250  Summer Intern returned to School (last day the 11th)
Mandeep Chahal 502876  Now with the new Power Co.
James Aimone  514849  Summer Intern returned to School (Last day the 11th)
Roman Zadorozhny 501778  Now with another co. in Enron

Please let me know if I need to do anything.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hello everyone:

Thanks to Krishna we have come up with a plan that I believe is going to 
save everyone some time.   We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with 
the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical 
order 
by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet.  

The spreadsheet is saved in O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets\MMM-DD.
(MMM = month and DD = 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time
period is 7/16 - 7/31/00).  The regular 8 hour days have already been entered 
for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type 
in 
your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save 
it.

If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and 
show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time, 
family 
time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes 
have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the 
spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever 
applies.  

If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time 
or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked 
and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time.  
There is no code for non-exempt overtime.

This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to
fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will
try and remind you by email the day before.

I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any 
other 
off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket 
for any 
reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your 
timesheet for you.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Dear All,

On 25th October I announced my resignation from Enron Europe to pursue other 
opportunities.  I just wanted to say that the past 3 1/2 years has been a 
very interesting and positive experience for me, having been a key part of 
such a dynamic and fast-moving organisation.  Enron is by far the best 
organisation I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have had the 
opportunity to work here and become a shareholder.  I have found it a real 
pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as 
exist within Enron Europe and Enron Corp in Houston & Portland and I 
genuinely wish you the best of success going forward.  I would also like to 
take this opportunity to thank Vince Kaminski, John Sherriff and Richard 
Lewis for hiring me in April 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and 
challenging projects to work on.

I have made some excellent friends at Enron and hope to keep them - I have a 
base in London and will probably be visiting Houston soon, so please feel 
free to stay in touch!

CONTACT:
E-mail:   citywhizkid@hotmail.com (easy to remember!)
Mobile:   0961 111 192
Home:    020 8877 9741
Address: Apt 213, Compass House, Riverside West, Smugglers Way, Wandsworth, 
London SW18

I will be at the Talbot pub tomorrow Friday 27th October from 6pm where I 
hope to catch up with you as a final farewell!

Best wishes for the future!

Anjam

Vince,

A reminder that I'm gone on Tuesday to Spearman.

Status of projects:

1.  Compound option for power structuring (Bernie, Edith Cross, Nick ?)
 Alex has finished the model.   Paulo has done some validation so we can 
probably release it.
 This is will be used for an exotic book, so we may have to help with VAR 
interface, etc.

2.  Followed up with Laine Borgman on DG contract.  We still need legal's 
sign off.

3.  Left a message and email about Tom Barkley with Molly Magee and told Tom 
that an offer would be coming by next week.

Good morning all:

I don't know where this request should go, would you please direct me in
the right direction?

Conference room EB 19C1 has one whole wall that is a white marker board.
We would like to see about having a wall like this installed in 19C2.  Please
let me know the costs and time involved.  Vince Kaminski has approved.

Thanks and have a great day!

I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the 
call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying to 
conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I 
mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me 
compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to 
quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent 
information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in 
many extra hours to help us out on this project.

I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.

Regards,

Craig

Stinson,

The spreadsheet below shows the allocations I made for EBS.
The numbers in magenta show percentage allocations,
Of course, Samir and Samer are gone, ad so is Roman.
The problem is that once I give the percentages to accounting they become 
fixed for one year.

Dr. Kaminski,
I can stop by any Thursday or Friday to meet Grant. I think that will
be great for me to understand better what you are doing in your group
and I will be doing this summer. Could you let me know which day would
work for you, please?

Don't forget to label each envelope, e.g. "Columbia", etc., and to sign
each envelope over the adhesive seal. I must receive the package

Thank you for your time, and happy holidays.

Sandeep:  Vince has asked me to coordinate with Margaret Daffin in our 
international group to ensure that we acquire an L1 visa for Anshuman.  This 
visa has to be in place before he will be able to work in the United States 
in any capacity.   (Anshuman cannot work in the US on a B-1 visa--he can only 
come here for business meetings or training.)  There are still several items 
remaining to be completed for the L-1 process.  The first is a fairly 
detailed job description for Anshuman.   Secondly, we will need to know 
whether or not he will either be in a managerial position or whether he will 
be managing a project while he is here in Houston.  Vince thought that you 
would be best able to provide this information to us, and we would really 
appreciate anything you can do to help us expedite this process.   

If you have any questions, please give me a call at x34804.  Thank you for 
your help.

Hi Kevin:

I was out of the office on Thursday and Friday.   I have discussed this with
Vince Kaminski and he says the charges are correct.  Jason Sokolov 
reports to Tanya Tamarchenko in the Research group and all of their
costs are charged to RAC.  

If you need further verification, please contact Vince Kaminski at 3-3848.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator

Subject: Sokolov EIS Expenses

Anita, the other day I called you to get Jason Sokolov's cost center.  Some 
of his EIS expenses (market data, long distance) for Jan and Feb 2001 were 
charged to the Enron Corp. RAC cost center.  In order for our accountants to 
reclass the expenses, we need your approval that the expenses can be moved.  

If this is okay, just reply back and let me know.

See the attached files for the detail of the expenses to be moved for Jan and 
Feb.


Thanks for your help,
Kevin

Vince,

Thanks for your support.   We will continue the Friday lunch series, which I 
think
is very useful for us to keep up with the lastest development in various 
areas.

Subject: Friday Brown Bag Lunch on Option Pricing

Zimin,

I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars 
will
crowd out the brown bag lunches.

The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and
have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.

For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag 
lunches
are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.

Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.

Vince

Subject: Friday Brown Bag Lunch on Option Pricing

Vince,
This is a brief summary of last year's Friday Brown Bag Lunch Option Pricing 
series.
We had about 15 lectures, given by the following people:
Grant, Stinston, Vasant, Krishna, Zimin, Maureen, Clayton, Paulo, Chonawee,  
myself, and
some outside speakers. We were able to attract some outside audience as well. 
Overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it. 

In light of the presently scheduled seminars on "Energy Derivatives", it 
seems our Friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on "Energy Derivatives" on 
two Fridays
and FBBLOP on other Fridays. What's your suggestion? Should we discontinue
the FBBLOP ?

We also have scheduled January 19 for Tom Halliburton's visitor Leon Lasdon 
from UT Austin
to talk on non-linear programming. Should we cancel it?

Best,
Zimin & Alex

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

Shirley:

Don't panic, but we have a new employee,  Chonawee Supatgiat, who is starting 
on Feb. 8th (yes, today).    Sorry about the short notice, but he just 
accepted on the 7th at 5 P.M.     He will be primarily supporting EBS (Enron 
Broadband Services) and reporting to Ravi, but we will need to find a spot 
for him on the 19th floor.   He can even use my office temporarily if needed 
since I have a desk on 44 as well.

I'll talk to you about the specifics in the morning.

thanks,

Bob,

I have asked Martin, Zimin, and Paulo to prepare short presentations on the 
power, gas, and crude markets, respectively.   This will take probably 45 
minutes of class time.    In addition I will prepare some lecture 
material.    If we don't have enough class time to cover all assigned 
problems, we can just roll them to the next class.

Thanks,

Stinson

Norma,

I would like to proceed on two fronts with Sevile (both H1 visa and
the Green Card. I shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy
here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements.
They can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them.

Sorry for the rescheduling.  Shalesh is unable to make it until late this 
afternoon.  Since what we have is informal and not urgent, perhaps we can 
catch you for a few minutes just sometime late today or tomorrow before you 
leave.  Otherwise, it can wait until you return.

I agree with what you say - my view is that Research can:
- assess a model;
- state what the model does;
- give a view of how closely the model achieves its objectives;
- assess what the risks of using the model are.  

It is for RAC to determine whether Enron is prepared to accept this risk.  I 
discussed this issue with Ted, and he seems to agree with this broad 
splitting of responsibilities.

Subject: Re: Research sign off  

Steve,

I understand your comments but the 'sign off' is a cross functional thing and 
research are effectively only being asked to sign off their part which is 
broadly as you describe below. If you have doubts as to the interpretation of 
a research sign off then it should be qualified to state what you are 
prepared to sign off on. Other functions should be asked to do like wise for 
their area which will mean that when all areas have signed off their part  
the picture is complete. Somebody needs to coordinate this and usually in 
London it is the Risk Management guy.

Does this make sense ?

Subject: Research sign off

Hi Sharad

I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to 
sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to 
do from time to time.

I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what 
it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and 
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot 
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I 
feel falls firmly within RAC territory.

This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other 
groups after all?  To "sign off" means to accept something, which our opinion 
in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical 
note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving 
the formal "sign off" to those best placed to assess these risks for our 
company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view 
on what is acceptable risk for the company.

Steve

Hello All:

I am afraid I did not allow enough time to do the time sheets by asking for
them by the 15th and 31st.  I really need these sheets by the 13th and 28th
of each month as it takes a good half day to enter all the new times in the
time sheets.

I am resending this, because as of now I have received very few timesheets
and I really need to start imputting the time.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hello everyone:

Well it is almost that time again!  I am going to try something different.  I 
am
forwarding you the time sheet by email.  Save the document to whatever
drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you 
had 
and return to me by email.   I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31st) of 
each
month.

This may work better than hand delivering.

Let me know what you think.

drill as last time, looking for someone whose done the quant track but with 
excellent writing skills.  I think I sent you a job description a few months

Can you help identify some candidates, and send their resumes our way?  Molly 
Magee is our recruiting expert and she can help setup the interviews with 
Maureen.  Maureen is still in London on secondment but is available to 
interview people of the phone.  

Thanks for your help.

I want to keep you informed about my visa status.
My current H1B visa expires on 15th January, 2000.  My H1B visa extension 
application has been submitted to INS by Milenia Soto, Enron's immigration 
attorney.  I spoke with Milenia Soto yesterday and came to know that she has 
not received the receipt yet, however, she told me that it is perfectly legal 
to work based on the fact that application for extension has been submitted 
to INS.

Milenia Soto has received the receipts from INS of my change of status 
application package which includes submission of applications for change of 
status,  work permit, advanced parole and finger print.  Earlier, my I-140 
application was approved by INS during the first week of September, 1999.

If you need additional information and/or want to contact Milenia Soto, her 
phone number is (713) 522 0141.

Sincerely,
Amitava Dhar

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

Zimin,

I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars 
will
crowd out the brown bag lunches.

The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and
have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.

For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag 
lunches
are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.

Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.

Subject: Friday Brown Bag Lunch on Option Pricing

Vince,
This is a brief summary of last year's Friday Brown Bag Lunch Option Pricing 
series.
We had about 15 lectures, given by the following people:
Grant, Stinston, Vasant, Krishna, Zimin, Maureen, Clayton, Paulo, Chonawee,  
myself, and
some outside speakers. We were able to attract some outside audience as well. 
Overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it. 

In light of the presently scheduled seminars on "Energy Derivatives", it 
seems our Friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on "Energy Derivatives" on 
two Fridays
and FBBLOP on other Fridays. What's your suggestion? Should we discontinue
the FBBLOP ?

We also have scheduled January 19 for Tom Halliburton's visitor Leon Lasdon 
from UT Austin
to talk on non-linear programming. Should we cancel it?

Best,
Zimin & Alex

Dear guys

Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the 
victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from 
its "hiding place" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep 
the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the 
drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on 
or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone 
sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my 
desk extensively reshuffled last week.

Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen 
from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a 
random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so 
interested in a Research guy's belongings!

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious 
activity around my desk?

Cheers,
Steve

Better late than never -- I again wanted to thank both of you for taking the 
time and making the effort to make the RAROC and Real Options presentations 
in Seoul earlier this month.  Both presentations were well received and I had 
a number of favorable comments and expressions of thanks form our hosts after 
the presentations.  I know you both have very busy schedules -- especially 
around this time of year -- and very much appreciate your help.   Regards.

Hi Lupe!

There are approximately 25 boxes, several small file cabinets and 2 plants (a 
3ft and  a 9ft plant) that are ready to be moved from 29 to 19.  This is part 
of the 29th floor 12/17 churn.

The items are located in various offices of the "Fishbowl" area on the 29th 
floor.  They are labeled with the 19th floor designated location.  

There are 2 larger file cabinets that are located in the hallway.

The 2 plants need to be taken to EB1944.

Is there anyway to work this in your schedule on tommorrow?

Thanks
Linda

Brad,

As per our previous discussions, Vince wanted me to give you the background 
on our request to bring Patricia Tlapek into the Research Group at the very 
top end of the manager group.  The justification for this was not only her 
extraordinary performance in setting up our Technical Analysis Section but 
also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope.

This memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning.

This past year Patricia was extremely successful in building internal 
clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on 
by gas, power, crude and equity marketers, as well as traders from the 
Calgary office.  In addition, she developed and presented seminars to bring 
traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis.

Also this last year Patricia built and populates daily the Research Group's 
intranet site on technical analysis.

As a crowning achievement (but just the beginning), Patricia was given the 
authority to actually trade natural gas as Jeff Shankman, Managing Director, 
authorized her book for technical analysis trading.  

Currently, we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel-wise 
and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade 
live books on other energy commodities and energy-related equities.

For these reasons, we want to peg Patricia's salary at the top of the pay 
scale.

Thanks for expediting this effort.

--- Mike

Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

Bhala,

I double checked with HR, and the offer you received is in line with what we 
are offering to other graduate level summer interns.   If you have better 
offers, I certainly wouldn't hold it against you for taking them over what we 
are offering, but we can't really justify raising the offer at this time.

We can re-imburse you for shipping expenses up to a reasonable amount, say 
$500, if you need to ship things down.   You can just save the receipts for 
these expenses and Shirley can fill out the necessary expense forms.

Best regards,

Stinson

The Enron Europe Research group has experienced rapid growth over the last 
year as it has become clear that there are tremendous opportunities to 
utilize their unique quantitative skills in supporting both new and ongoing 
business efforts in the London offices.  Because of this, we are appointing a 
group leader with the view to leveraging the group better across the many 
business areas in Enron Europe which are benefiting from research support.

Effective immediately, Steven Leppard will take responsibility for 
spearheading research efforts in London and managing the London based 
research team.  Steve joined Enron in early 1999 and has distinguished 
himself through his many contributions including analysis of the "Supergoal" 
scheduling system and development of a diagrammatic approach for real options 
analysis.  He holds a PhD. in Mathematical Physics from Kings College London 
and an honours degree in Mathematics from Imperial College.   Steve is also a 
black-belt level instructor in Kungfu.

Please join us in congratulating Steve on his new responsibilities.

Vince and Stinson,

I would like to thank you for helping me trying to find an Internship. I
really appreciate the attention you gave to me.

I am happy to tell you that I found an internship in my area of interest
with MFRGroup.  It is a consulting company that provides management
consulting, advisory, finance, operations management and information
technology services.  I will be helping them to develop a new business
related with e-commerce B-to-B.

>From now on, I will be concentrating my efforts in finding a full time
position, because I will graduate at the end of the year.  I do not want to
miss Enron's deadline, and I am still very interested in EnronOnline
business.  Please keep me updated if any opportunity arises.

Thanks again

Carla Di Castro

PS: Vince, I tried to call you today, but it looks like you will be out of
the office until Monday. I just wanted to say thank you.

Dear Youyi:

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.

Craig-

Thanks for the feedback.

I've received similar reports from other research customers on various 
non-recurring and on-going projects Elena has been able to help out on.

The most recent member of a long line of Rice MBA candidates who have "made a 
difference" in our research efforts, Elena will be staying with us throughout 
this next (her final) year.

She'll be working the morning shift.

Please let us know if she, or any other member of our group can assist you in 
any way.

- Mike

Ken,

Either is really fine with me.   I'm glad to have you coming.   I will be out 
of the office on Nov. 21 and the 22nd is likely to be a short day for most 
people, so starting on Nov. 27 would probably work the best for us.

Stinson,

I have talked with folks here at FN, and I am happy to say that may be able
to start at Enron as soon as Monday November 20, the week of Thanksgiving.
I am in the process of wrapping up my existing projects, but it appears that
things are coming together well, and I may be able to leave a little earlier
than I had thought.  Would you prefer that I start the week after
Thanksgiving?

It makes also sense to ask Paulo every time to say a few words.

Vince,

Thanks for your reply.   That is what I feel too: Vince knows what we are 
doing, so he does not have to ask us again.

In another dimension,  I want to make sure that people like Paulo get enough 
incentive to perform.   The group meeting, I
think, will provide a sense of accomplishment when other members in the group 
know what we have been through.

Thanks again for your understanding.

Zimin,

Sorry if you get this impression. The real reason is that I treat
the lunch meetings as an opportunity to get updates on things
that are going on at more remote locations. I interact with each of the
members of your group daily and I know what's going on.

I agree with you, however, that the lunch meetings are not exclusively
for my benefit,  but also for the benefit of  the other members of
the group. I shall make sure that you have the opportunity
to communicate  your contribution to the company.

Vince and Stinson,

The valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months.  The 
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing.   However, when comes to the
staff meeting (Thursday lunch meeting), we are often left out for updating 
our projects.
This makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth 
mentioning.

I am hoping that we can get  more exposure, despite we are still in the old 
economy.

I will be working from my home this afternoon after 1:30 PM.  My extension 
will be forwarded to my home.  If I happen to be away from the phone taking 
care of my mother, leave a message and I will return your call immediately.  
There is a generic message on my home phone, "Please leave message after 
tone", so don't worry that you have the wrong number.  You may reach me by 
email at adupont@pdq.net.  In the next several days, I will be set up to dial 
in and you will be able to use my regualr Enron email address.  I will be at 
my desk most days, but until we have mother settled in the Rehab facility 
there may be some days or afternoons that I will be working at home.  Please 
do not hesitate to contact me if you need meetings set up or any other thing 
that you would normally request of me.  Thanks.  Anita

Norma,

Thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for Martin 
Lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for 
him.   As I mentioned during our meeting, just my small team within research 
has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years, and we have had a hard time 
recruiting good candidates.   Last year we made an offer to a person 
graduating from UT (MS in computational finance) of 75K plus 25K signing 
bonus.   He replied that he would like to work at Enron but was already in 
the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $100K.    
Martin is a very skilled individual with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering 
and almost two years experience at Enron.   He would be very difficult (and 
expensive) to replace.    For this reason I feel it necessary to be proactive 
in finding ways of retaining him as an employee.

Please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1-year 
retention bonus of 10K and a raise to 87K base salary for Mr. Lin.  I would 
plan to then give Martin an additional raise at his next review period.

Regards,

Stinson

Thanks for the update. Two points.

Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated
with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.

I shall choose Neil.

Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke 
earlier.   It really doesn't make any difference since he will need to get an 
L1 visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his

Hi Norma,

	Sevil's primary project has been the Generation Bidding Analysis for the East Power Desk.  She worked closely with the Power Fundamentals group and the IT group in collecting and organizing the data, and then developing the analysis.  Sha has focused on the PJM area and plans to expand the analysis to other regions in the East.
	Sevil has also investigated the issue of Risk Premia in Power Prices compared to Marginal Cost.

Norma:

Ted Murphy would like to have Jason removed from his cost center 
effective  December 16th.  Vince said that it would be ok to have him 
added to our cost center, effective that date.  He is not supposed to start 
with the Research Group until the 28th, but needs a home from the 16th to 
the 28th, so we will pick him up.

Can you take care of this?

Thanks!

Rabi,

You and Tanya  should go ahead with the course you have already registered 
for.
I have just mentioned it  FYI.

I don't see too many problems  with the  course Stinson
may help to arrange. The alternative course can be scheduled on premises, 
late in the day
and distributed over longer  time period.

Vince,
Tanya and I are registered for the offsite (Productivity Point) Java Class 
(Feb12-16).   Before I go ahead and try to cancel the reservation, I need 
some guidance from you (and/or Tanya) in light of the following issues:

1.  Do you really want 15 people from the same group be unavailable at the 
same time?  

2.  Enron gets 30% discount from  the list price ($2125) of the Productivity 
Point Java class.  Hence cost difference is $500 per person and not $1100 as 
originally thought. 

3.  Contents of the in-house class can be be tailored to match the skill  
level of a more homegenous group.  

Plese advise.  Thanks,

Rabi

Vince,

Norma called and said that Rakish had requested stock options instead of a 
signing bonus.    She suggested giving $30K worth of options which would vest 
over a 3 year period, and I told her that I am sure this would be fine with 
you.   It should cost us less than the offered cash bonus of $20k.

Hello all:

If you think any of your people would be interested in the following - plea=

Thanks!

Message One

Dear everyone,=20

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working=
=20
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all=
=20
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find=
=20
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,=
=20
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep=
=20
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, le=
t=20
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of=
=20
this group.=20

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag=
=20
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. =
=20
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20
technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that w=
e do=20
not have to reinvent the wheels. =20

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us wil=
l=20
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from=
=20
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing=
,=20
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything=
=20
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have=
=20
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20
presentation style.  It could be =20
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style=
=20
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon th=
e=20
responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin o=
r=20
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and=
=20
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to=
=20
hear your presentation.=20

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give=
 a=20
talk or just sit in.=20

(precise title

make this a new Enron tradition!

Best regards.

Oh Dear!

I thought it was all straight.  EB1931 was my room on the original floor 
plan, 
but somehow they changed the numbers.  We were all packed, everything 
was ready for the move and I just happened to come to the 19th floor the
day of the move and noticed that they had renumbered all of the rooms!
The move team hurredly put stickers (with the old numbers) on the doors
of each room.

I am now in EB 1961.  Vince Kaminski is in 1962.  If you need the names
for all of the other rooms, let me know.

Sorry!

Shirley,

Although the rent for your locations on the 19th floor has been updated, I've 
just received a relocation update for some folks moving from the 45th floor 
to the 19th floor tonight.  The odd thing is that among many other locations, 
the following locations were included (which you've already requested be 
assigned to 0011/100038):

EB 1930
EB 1931
EB 1932
EB 1933
EB 1934
EB 1935
EB 1936

Please let me know if they should stay assigned to your group or should they 
be assigned to this other group's R/C.

Thank you.

The following locations on the 29th floor are still assigned to 0011/100038.  
They were not listed on the December 17th Churn Relocation Request.  So, are 
the personnel in these locations still reporting to 0011/100038 or are they 
moving later.  Please advise:

On Saturday I came to work and did some things that I needed to do.
Also, there were some things  left undone that  I felt I should do. 

Mainly the conference room - We will schedule all birthday's and meetings in 
the large conference room therefore , I made the room look more spacious.

Also on Monday - we need to check with the painters too see if they are going 
to repair our walls.

We also need to get the additional pictures from the cage and get 
them placed on the wall whereby the move can be completed.

If either of you have any questions or know of more things to do please
let's get together and discuss.


                                                                Thanks

Or, may be we can get better speaker phone?

Hi Tanya,

in my view it is very good if Stig and Kirstee are involved in your VaR meetings. Therefore, I think it is very useful for them to call Houston.

Could we get a little bit better equipment to allow them to hear everything well?

many thanks,

Slava

Subject:	VaR meetings in Houston   

Hi Slava,

Kirstee and I find it useful to listen in on the VaR meetings in Houston on Wednesdays. 
However, it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical problem: we hear little or nothing at times. 
A possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install a "spider phone" in the VaR meeting room. 
What I mean is a phone similar to the one in the RAC morning meetings which have several remote speakers going out 
from the main phone (do you understand what I mean?). If this is done, we would  hear everyone around the table, 
not just those seated close to the phone. 

What is you opinion on 
A. us in  London calling in  to these meetings
B. getting some better equipment which would make it easier to follow the conversation ("spider phone" or  bigger speaker ..)

Please let me know what your thoughts are,

Best regards,

Stig

I'm scheduled to attend the quarterly new-hire orientation all day on 16 
March.  I had planned to work the morning rush and then go over there.  Can 
we cover the noon and 2:00 p.m. tasks?

Sam

I think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead.
I don't see a  justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
Monday.

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
meetings to take place?

Dear Vince,

When we talked last, you mentioned you were considering making additions to 
your office staff.  If you are still considering these additions, I would 
like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me.  It would be 
wonderful to work with a group such as yours.

It has been great working in recruiting, but the time has come for me to try 
something else.  I am beginning to look around, but wanted to talk to you 
first.  If my skill sets match a position you might be adding, please 
consider me.  I have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what 
I have done.

Thank you for your consideration.  Have a great Thanksgiving!

Enron supports employees' involvement in civic organization
and I think you should continue tour involvement with LWF.
It's important that we give  something back  to society.
You don't have to take a day off to attend workshops.

Vince,

I am currently a candidate member of Leadership Fort Worth through August of 
2001.  I don't know if you are familiar with Leadership Houston or any other 
Leadership group, but it is basically a civic organization that provides a 
forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for 
civic leadership.  For their first year, members are candidates and must 
attend about 1 full-day workshop a month in FW, normally on a Thursday.  
After that, members can transfer to other Leadership cities.  I talked with 
Stinson about the group and he thought I should talk with you about whether 
or not I should stay involved with LFW.  The attached email describes the 
December meeting scheduled for 12/14.  Thanks 

ken

Also, please plan for a trip to London in 3-4 weeks.

Hi Stinson,

broadband area.

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

Molly,

We would like to go ahead with an offer to Kenneth.    After talking to him 
again, I think he will accept.

We would like to offer him the equivalent package to an incoming Associate, 
which I understand would be $76K base and a signing bonus of $20K.

He position would be a specialist or senior specialist (whichever fits the 
salary) reporting to me.

agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution.

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.

Christian,

Our Spring/Fall window of "<nactivity"is rapidly eluding us...

We need to get our internal model operational without delay.

Along these lines, let's go ahead and plan your visit to Houston as soon as 
possible, 
but by all means get you in at least 4 weeks before hurricane season.

That would mean the month of May looks good.

Please inform me what duties you could not perform from here to support the 
Sydney office, 
we'll figure out how to keep that office whole.

(it's working without a hitch to have Steve Bennett in London, but continuing 
his Houston duties)

If the first week in May (for the whole month) will work, please respond asap 
and we'll get housing arrangements finalized.

Looking forward to your visit,

- - - Mike

Mark,

First let me say thank you for your assistance in making it possible for meteorologists Tony Hamilton and Stephen Bennett to hit the groung running this week when they came over to London from Houston.  When we came into our offices in Houston Monday morning, Tony and Steve had already gathered and analyzed their data, prepared reports and were ready for the Avistar briefings! The cross-Atlantic communication and data-sharing and manipulation went seamlessly!  We have great expectations for continued synergy with this new set-up.

The Research Weather Group is excited about our expanded responsibilities in London. We are committed to maximizing the value added we can provide to the Weather Derivatives, Crude & Products, UK Trading, Continental Power, and Analytics efforts.  We are, however,  also extremely dependent on computers and communication, associated software and peripherals.  Plus the datastreams we access and the reports we generate are very time-critical in their value to traders.  We need a very stable environment, with reliable back-up and 24-hour support to fulfill our commitments to providing the trading operation with timely, never-fail research and information flows.

So, thanks again, and  please do whatever you can to continue this high level of support by passing this letter of praise and thanks to your team, and show them our appreciation for your efforts.

Mike Roberts

Vince,

The A/A program does not have a contract in place with Melly Language 
Services.  It appears that by the note below from my contact in the A/A-HR 
department, the reimbursement policy appears to be driven by department, not 
Enron at large.

As I mentioned earlier, if I continue with my current tutor, but outside of 
the Melly Language Services, the cost to the department will decrease for me 
to take French classes.

Pls advise if Research will be able to continue to fund my lessons.

Many thanks,

Gwyn Koepke

Gwyn,

In the past the Associate & Analyst program use to pick-up the cost for the 
classes, but they stopped doing so effective 1/99.  (Although, some business 
units decided to continue paying for it - you may want to double check with 
your business unit to whether or not they have a contract.  The A/A dept does 
not.)   Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thank you for your patience.

Ivonne,

I am currently enrolled in a french language class thru Enron and Melly's 
Language Services, and my group is paying the cost directly.

I am considering quitting the Melly's Language Program in favor of an outside 
private tutor, for a number of reasons.  It will be cheaper too.

I would like to know:

1.  Does Enron have a contract in place with Melly's Language Service, to be 
the exclusive provider of language services to Enron?

2.  Will Enron pay the costs of my language classes if they are held outside 
of the Melly contract (if any)?

I just want to make sure that if I decide to "drop out" of the Melly classes 
and sign up for other private tutoring courses, which will be less expensive 
than the Melly Svc, that Enron will not have a problem picking up the tab.  
Vince Kaminski, the MD, wants to know this, to ensure there is no legal 
restriction on who must provide these language services in order to secure 
Enron reimbursement.

Thanks for your help.

Gwyn Koepke

Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is 
moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I 
met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up 
a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so 
that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during 
the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me 
this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so 
that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look 
forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff 
meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Dave,

No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.

Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group
who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).

I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He 
wants to come back 
after 2 months.

My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite 
competent.
I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other 
side
of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. "The 
Return of Grant 
Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth 
opportunities (and that
I am good manager).

Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the
hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just 
re-instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required 
to hire a VP.

Shijie:

I spoke with Vince and he said Friday the 28th of July would be fine for
your visit to Enron.

Please let me know your itinerary when you have it confirmed.  There
are two hotels downtown Houston, The Doubletree and the Hyatt Regency
that are very close to the Enron Bldg.

If you need help with anything, please let me know.

Look forward to having you at Enron.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Stinson,

Thank you for following up promptly with support on Martin Lin.  I spoke with 
Vince regarding a conversation I had with Compenstation yesterday.  
Compensation has recently comleted an analysis for Vince's group and 
determined that the appropriate salary for Managers in Research should be 
90,000.

The following will be his pay structure:

Effective   August 1, 2000
Job Title   Manager
Base Salary  $90,000  
Retention Bonus $10,000 (ending 8/1/2001)

Please provide a job title that you would feel appropriate for this positon. 
If you would like to discuss please let me know.

Subject: Martin Lin

Norma,

Thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for Martin 
Lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for 
him.   As I mentioned during our meeting, just my small team within research 
has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years, and we have had a hard time 
recruiting good candidates.   Last year we made an offer to a person 
graduating from UT (MS in computational finance) of 75K plus 25K signing 
bonus.   He replied that he would like to work at Enron but was already in 
the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $100K.    
Martin is a very skilled individual with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering 
and almost two years experience at Enron.   He would be very difficult (and 
expensive) to replace.    For this reason I feel it necessary to be proactive 
in finding ways of retaining him as an employee.

Please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1-year 
retention bonus of 10K and a raise to 87K base salary for Mr. Lin.  I would 
plan to then give Martin an additional raise at his next review period.

Regards,

Stinson

The interviews conducted on February 2 are just exploratory interviews to
see where Punit might fit within Enron.  Vince thought he might fit in John's
group. 

The title and $$ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he
should be (if at all).  If John is interested after the interview, then he and
Vince can get together to discuss $$ and title.

If you or John have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Would John be interested in interviewing him?  I am attaching his resume

Subject: Volumetric Optionality Model Changes

As a result of meetings with Zimin Lu (Houston Research) and Anjam Ahmad in 
early June, the gas desk together with research will be revising the models 
for pricing options on volume (swing) and similar products. 

The idea is to have a consistent method that can be applied to all contracts. 
This will affect:
 flat price gas swing options
 indexed gas swing options
 J-Block contract
 modified Thermbank contract
 EnBank (virtual storage)
 
The new feature that will be introduced into all models is ability for 
real-time MTM (and prospectively - sensitivities calculations).

The work will be carried out as follows:

Natasha Danilochkina: problem definition, contracts/products summary, 
functional specification
Anjam Ahmad:  Zimin's model modifications/implementation and Houston/London 
interaction

start date:  June 16th, 2000
end date: TBC

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks

Vince, 
 Today is the last day of my internship here this summer.  I have had a 
terrific summer.  Thank you so much for all of your support!  I have talked 
with my supervisor from this group and I am pleased that he feels strongly 
and positively about my performance.  Of course, my job decision is a very 
important one for me and as I consider job offers in the upcoming months, a 
variety of factors will be influencing my choice.  Certainly one of them will 
be the positive experiece I have had with Enron.  But regardless of my 
decision in future, I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to glimpse 
into Enron's business and culture.  I have met some amazing people here, and 
my experience with Enron is something I will always take with me whereever I 
go.  

I hope to hear from you again.  Please feel free to contact me at any time.  
My email remains: vngo@rice.edu and I will leave Shirley my phone number as 
soon as I know it!

Deepest regards,
Van

Sandeep:  further to my voice mail to you today, I will meet with Anshuman at 
10:30 am and will keep his documents in a file.

However, without some type of job offer in the US, we cannot move forward 
with an L1 visa for him and if you believe he will not be returning to the US 
to work, then we really do not need to get him the L1 at this time.

If the circumstances change, please let me know.

Margaret

Please find attached the resume of Anshuman, as well as the form needed for

Copies of all required material for the visa, has already been put into

Please do call me at 713-857-6826.  I want to reschedule today's meeting for 
another time, since we are working on a deadline here.

Hi,

     Thanks for the Fed Ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent
information about Enron.

     I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of
other forms.  You should receive these documents via Fed Ex on tomorrow
morning.

     Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in California, I won't
be able to start until March 1st.  I hope that is okay.

     Thanks so much.

Regards,
Iris

Jim,

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS
came from Ravi Thuraisingham. My understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy
him. I shall be glad to keep him in the Research Group in his current role.

Have a good 4th of July.

Vince

Norma,

It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and
merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the 
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.

As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity 
raises.
The column totals are misleading.

I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).

Could all of you please give access to your calendars (Lotus Organizer) to 
Anita DuPont, and also make sure that if you step away from your desk that 
your calendar indicates where you will be?  It has happened a few times 
recently that people have come for appointments and the person has been away 
from his/her desk and Anita could not get hold of the person.  This does not 
portray a good image of the group.  Also, if you have cell phones, please 
make sure Anita has the number.

Also, please make sure to complete your self-assessment performance review, 
and either indicate list of projects worked on since June in there or at 
least separately e-mail me a list.

Thanks,
 Vasant

Hi Maureen,

Thanks very much for presenting yesterday. Your presentation created much 
interest and as always we look forward to your return to London office for 
another talk.  The viewing statistics on IPTV were excellent and are as 
follows:

Current: 85
Cumulative: 110

I have spoken to the audio visual team regarding the possibility of showing 
your presenting on IPTV in Houston. It will take a couple of days to encode 
the videotape, but as soon as this done, I will send a copy to you in 
Houston. They are also looking send the file to the relevant person in 
Houston so they can put in on IPTV. 

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to call me.

Kind regards and thanks again

The Research Group:

It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be
leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today.

Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and
stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed.

We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with
all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I
will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and
Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An
announcement will be forthcoming at a later date.

Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".

Sincerely,

Vince

Jeff,

I met with Li Sun last night and I shall take her for the first rotation.
She comes across as a very smart and highly motivated person.

I am planning to go with Mark Palmer to Wharton in October to
finalize the deal.

i've asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince's 
group.  this issue needs to  be resolved by week's end--we look like we don't 
have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to 
make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new 
wharton recruit disgruntled.

vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up 
with our meeting with skilling?  thanks very much...

Just wanted to check with you to see if you have a preference as to when you 
would like to have your mid-year PRC meeting.  If you and your team are 
available, I would prefer to have it on either June 12th, 13th or 14th.  I am 
very flexible though, so please just let me know so that I can start making 
the necessary accommodations.

I will be working from my home this afternoon after 1:30 PM.  My extension will be forwarded to my home.  If I happen to be away from the phone taking care of my mother, leave a message and I will return your call immediately.  There is a generic message on my home phone, "Please leave message after tone", so don't worry that you have the wrong number.  You may reach me by email at adupont@pdq.net.  In the next several days, I will be set up to dial in and you will be able to use my regualr Enron email address.  I will be at my desk most days, but until we have mother settled in the Rehab facility there may be some days or afternoons that I will be working at home.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need meetings set up or any other thing that you would normally request of me.  Thanks.  Anita

Hi Vince,  I already spoke with Maureen and we discussed timing.  Yana will 
stay until a replacement is found and trained.   As for the permanent

Andrea,

It's fine with me. Few points:

1. As a courtesy to Maureen Raymond, please, discuss the timing with her.

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATION.
     She was hired directly and   this means that we transfer her

I spoke to Yana today and understand that you are supportive of Yana rotating 
through our group, EIM Fundamental Analysis.  We are very pleased that Yana 
will be joining us.  Her skill set will be particularly helpful as we build 
the steel business.

I was hoping that Yana could begin working with us mid December.   Does a 
start date in EIM of Dec. 18 work for you?  Please let me know.

Once again, thank you for your support.

Hello Celeste:

Plans are in the works to rotate Roy Ibasco from the Research Group into 
Henry Arora's group.  Vanessa Carranza is handling the churn request.  I am 
not sure of the rotation date, but we need his desk by the 15th for Gwyn 
Koepke.

You probably already know all of this, but just in case.

The computer will be moved  to desk in our area
until the new hire arrives.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for your prompt response.  I do realize
that the A&A Program has finished accepting
candidates for this summer; I was inquiring about
the possibility of hiring on an individual basis.

Again, I greatly appreciate your time.  I look
forward to seeing you soon!

Hi Vince,  
   Yannis of the Weather desk is planning to develop relationship with Prof 
Rene Carmona in doing weather analysis.  To start this off, they are planning 
to pay  Prof Carmona to give a training class as outlined below, and they 
want to know if Research is willing to send people and bear part of the costs.

 We can talk more at 4:00 pm, but while there is no doubt that getting people 
from outside to present new ideas is always important and interesting, I 
think Research Group members can easily give most of these talks.  
Apparently, people are interested in these topics and are willing to pay to 
listen.  My thought is that if the intent is to develop relationships, that 
is fine, but the Research Group should also be given the opportunity to 
provide more training and get more visibility.  I have already communicated 
this to Joe and to Yannis.

Vasant

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks

Dear Ron,

My boss, Enron's chief international economist, is interested in talking with SAIS grads who might want to come to Houston and do economics work.  Same drill as last time, looking for someone whose done the quant track but with excellent writing skills.  I think I sent you a job description a few months back.

Can you help identify some candidates, and send their resumes our way?  Molly Magee is our recruiting expert and she can help setup the interviews with Maureen.  Maureen is still in London on secondment but is available to interview people of the phone.  

Thanks for your help.

Hi, Vince,

I was told by Molly that she hasn't received the recommendation form from you 
yet.

Since I got admission late from the school, now I am short of time of getting 
I-20 which needs loan approval,
and getting visa status transferred (from H-1 to F-1) which requires I-20 and 
loan approval 
and normally takes around 45 days through INS (Immigration Naturalization 
Service).

Now, I am trying to push every step to speed up the process in order to 
catch up the school opening at beginning of Sept.

I know I just told you this late last week. Nevertheless, I am writing to see
if you can squeeze some time to finish the recommendation form anytime soon. 
It will be a big help.

Thank you very much, Vince.
Have a good day.

Sincerely,

All

On Monday 21st February a new analyst will be joining Enron Europe, and will 
have his first rotation in the London Research Group.

Matthew Williams has a PhD in high energy physics, having carried out his 
research at Imperial College London and CERN.  His academic experience 
includes extensive monte carlo simulation as part of his research on the 
phenomenology of supersymmetry theories.

Matthew will be working with me on issues arising from the optimisation and 
control of dynamic systems, which we expect to include power generation 
scheduling and gas flow.

Steve

Thanks for the interest so many of you have shown in Trash Bash.  Several of 
you are of the mistaken idea that TRASH BASH is tomorrow.  It is not until 
SATURDAY, MARCH 31, 2001.   Registration will be in Sam Houston Park and 
trash will be picked up along Buffalo Bayou from So. Shephard to the Wortham 
Center.   The work areas will be divided into 8 to 10 Sections.  When you 
check in, you will be assigned to a work section.  If you are going to work 
at the Registration Desk, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 7:30 AM.  If 
you are going to pick-up trash, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 8:00 AM.

There will be a pre-registration desk set up in the Lobby of the Enron Bldg. 
sometime during the week of March 26th and I will let you know the exact 
dates when they are given to me.  If you pre-register, you won't have to 
stand in the long lines at Sam Houston Park.

Thanks again for your interest and help.

Anita

Hi Shalesh:

The move team has informed me that they will not be able to move your
telephone until Wednesday, the 23rd.    I have asked them to bring you
boxes by Friday, but I have not heard back from them.  Your computer
is here, but without a telehone, you may not want to move down here
until the 23rd.

Just to let you know.

Have a great day!

Hi Mel

Further to our earlier discussions here's the full list of actions we'd like 
to put into place regarding Anjam's departure:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1 
is completed (cataloguing his work).
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.
3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in 
the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.
5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail.
6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.

Vince has OK'd this lot, so let's do it ASAP.

Many thanks,
Steve

Hi Stinson, as per my discussion, here is e-mail to let Vince know about the 
subject.

We have requested the following office spaces for Network planning (Jim 
Irvine)--optimization work, etc. and other EBS support personnel.

For network planning and traffic Engineering: 

-  1 director level space ( to be used by Jim and other EBS research people 
as needed when Jim is not there) and  four other cube space (Chonowee, Martin 
Lin, and two students.

For other EBS activities:
- 3 or 4 summer interns and analysts level space for other EBS people (Roman 
and other students).

This is what Kristy is going to request and get it into the office space 
request loop. We should be able to get into most of the space that I have 
requested.

Ravi.

Hi, Vince,

How are you? 

Just last week, I got admission from U. of Chicago MBA program, so did Yvan, 
by the way.

Now, I am applying loan from Enron A/A pool.
The person who is in charge of this told me that it needs three 
recommendations from current boss and previous boss for the application, and 
that the requirement includes all PRC rankings in either 'excellent' or 
'superior', that I didn't achieve in the first rotation in Research.

Getting loan is cricial at the stage. I wonder if you can be one of my 
recommenders.
This will be a big help.

Thank you.

Dave,

I would like to recommend to you Sandeep Kohli who is likely to approach you 
regarding a
position in your area.

I have  been working with Sandeep for a number of years and I was always 
impressed with his
skills, intelligence and mature, thoughtful approach to solving business 
problems.

He is currently located in India (our DPC unit) and is looking for a 
permanent position with Enron in Houston
for family reasons (his wife is from Houston and has a family here). Of 
course, there are
some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.

In case I forget by Monday:  Hector Campos asked if he can take a course in

I discovered that Clewlow and Strickland have at least two books,
"Implementing Derivative Models," and "Exotic Options."  I gather that "Exotic
Options" is the one you intend to use in your class, correct?

By the way, I queried participants in my class, and I heard that the case
study approach we occaisionally used was appreciated by several.  The VAR
class I taught was from Jorian's book, which has no exercises and which
assumes a particular background in finance and statistics.  I created a
problem (not exactly a case study) that required participant to learn some
statistics and try some different approaches.  From this, participants got a
better idea of why one bothers with certain issues.  Some liked the "real
world" flavor of this kind of approach.  (Without the case approach, you could
provide good counterexampes as a partial remedy.)

Best regards and Season's Greetings,
Michael

Iain:

We went and looked at the Toshiba copier on the 32nd floor and while it
does not appear to be extremely fast, I believe it will work for the 19th
floor.  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and he agreed with our getting this
copier. 

We noticed this copier has a button that says "Network connection"
and were wondering it this copier could be hooked up to the network and
we could run copies from our computer?  Please let us know.  

Thanks for all your help and have a wonderful Christmas and New

Shirley ,

Following up on the telephone conversation, please see the attached 
spreadsheet for pricing information PLUS important information about "True 
World" copy speeds. 

Pricing was centered on the 42.315K per month volume band so that you can get 
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes. I have 
left the spreadsheet "unprotected" so that you can play with the volume 
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the "Cost Per Image" 
is affected by volume changes.

? Pricing Spreadsheet: Under "NOTES" towards under the pictures.

The "True World" copy speed information has been supplied by Buyers Lab 
Incorporated, which is an independent testing house that rates office 
equipment, including copiers and publishes their findings on a quarterly 
basis. Unfortunately they have not released their findings on the Canon IR550 
as testing is not yet complete.

? Copier Speeds: @ the end of the Notes-Mail
{These include 1-1, 1-2 and duplexing + detail on completion of "sets"}

As you will see, duplexing speeds are widely different across the various 
manufacturers equipment & the "True World" copy speeds are a soft $ expense 
which impacts the true cost of running a copier.

Here is the PRICING SPREADSHEET for your records: --> 

The highlighted rows on the spreadsheet reflect you current average monthly 
volume.

FYI --> Target CPI or Cost Per Image is in the region $0.017 up to and 
including $0.023. 


Copier Model Monthly Volume Capacities
Model        Manufacturer Max Rec/Level  Realistic Level {Up to}
Toshiba 5570     340K        115K
Toshiba 6570     400K        135K

Canon IR550    200K          100K
Canon IR600    250K          100K

FYI: We currently have a Toshiba 6570 @ EB32K1 that is averaging 69,332 
images per month with the top month producing 86,673 images and a Toshiba 
5570 @ EB3080 area that is averaging 39,309 per month. Both of these machines 
are in the Enron North America Trading environment.

The copiers quoted are all "Digital".
Digital: Scan once print many = 99 copies of one sheet? 1 Scan!
Analog: Scan for every image made = 99 copies of 1 sheet? 99 Scans = Possible 
noise issue.

Copier Speeds = Total print time
This comparison gives the speed @ which the document set is printed

Norma,

I have attached an updated org chart for my team.    




I think the following changes need to be made
1.  Paulo Issler is reporting to Zimin Lu
2.  Shalesh Ganjoo is reporting to me (who does the system show as his 
supervisor, Zimin?)

Also, I just found out that Chonawee did not get his mid-year review.     I 
didn't realize that Samer Takriti never gave him a review.   I have found all 
of the mid-year feedback for Chonawee, but I don't have an official "form" to 
fill out for him to sign.   Can you send one to me, or what should I do?

Thanks,

Stinson

Richard has agreed to pay for Matt's visit, so here's the schedule so far:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
      (No crossover with Matt, ensures power cover in London office.)
Matt  A couple of weeks in August. (Preferably the hottest ones.)
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.

Vince,

Please check the University of California Energy Institute web site (
http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/). You may already be aware of it but if 
you are not, there are lots of paper that I am using as a reference and that 
you might be interested in reading them. Also, every year they are holding a 
one day power conference in UC Berkeley. I'd like to attend the one in March 
of 2001. Is that fine?

Gentlemen,

Thank you for your time and consideration yesterday.  I am excited about
working for Enron and gladly accept your offer.

To reiterate our consensus today, I will be working an average of 10 hours a
week, mostly early mornings from around 5 to 7.  Another option for me might
be to work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from around 5 to 8 or 9.

Toni Graham was my contact in HR six months ago.  She is probably more
familiar with my previous file than anyone else.  If you have any questions
or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,
Chris Pernoud

The Research Group:

It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be
leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today.

Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and
stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed.

We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with
all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I
will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and
Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An
announcement will be forthcoming at a later date.

Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".

Sincerely,

Vince

I hardly know what to say!!!  What a great turnout from the Research 
Department.   We had 15 including spouses and children who worked Check-in 
and picked up trash.  Thanks so much.  Everyone from Community Relations was 
blown away by the turnout we had from Research.  I heard very nice comments 
about our effort and about the fact that Vince came out and worked.  Thanks 
again for all your support.  I personally appreciated it and I know everyone 
else from Enron that was involved in this event appreciated it because I got 
so many comments about our participation.  I don't know what else to say but 
that you are a GREAT GROUP.   Anita

Hi Reggie,
We spoke regarding the chairs on Monday.
Please,  we need these chairs as soon as possible ,without being charged.
We paid for all new chairs each time we moved and it's not fair we pay again.

Reggie,

There may already be a request floating around for a standard black office 
chair for EB1972d.  It was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago.  In 
addition to that one, my own chair at EB3132A was stolen this past weekend.  
Could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us?

If you need to charge them to us, our numbers are 0011 and 100038.  As 
always, call me if you need to at x58322.

Thanks!

Sam Smith

to contribute to the growth of our city and to make sure that Enron is not 
embarrassed  if other energy companies show 
up in strength.

Subject: Enron Earth Day "Trash Bash"

Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.  The first annual 
Enron "Trash Bash" to clean up the banks of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd 
Drive and Sam Houston Park. 

I am chairing the Check-In Team which consists of:
Registering all of the Volunteers
Handing out Enron T-Shirts and Caps
Passing out Gloves and Garbage Bags
Making Clean Up Section Assignments
For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext. 
30329.


Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along Buffalo Bayou and pick up 
trash.  This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs 
youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop.  It will also be fun.  They 
will have live bands, lyou get an Enron T-shirt and Enron Baseball Cap, lunch 
will be served at Sam Houston Park and there are a lot of good door prizes.   
If you want to volunteer for the "Trash Bash" clean up, just show up at Sam 
Houston Park on Saturday, March 31, 2001, at 8 AM to Register.  Clean up 
starts at 9 AM and lunch will be served at 11:00 AM and after lunch door 
prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your 
part for Houston's Waterway Environment.

I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. and help 
Enron clean up the Environment.

Thanks, Anita

Vince,

I am planning to make my resignation from Enron so that June 5th would be my last day at work.   I am interested in the trading opportunity this fall and will talk again with Andy about it.    It will still make sense for me to resign in the mean time in order that I may start burning my non-compete period to open up my other options.   In addition, it  will allow me to be rehired without the burden of the noncompete should I come back in the fall.

Regards,

Stinson

Vince --

We have been working the last few days to get ENA's United Way participation 
rate up as high as possible.  I called earlier about your Cost Center because 
the following 16 employees were listed in Power Trading, but I believe are 
part of the Research organization.

If you have a chance, could you encourage them to log onto 
http://unitedway.enron.com on the intranet and make a contribution to the 
United Way.  The deadline is today.

Thanks.

Eric

Do you know who Todd Kimberlain is?  Is he supposed to be in the Research
Group and charged to our cost center?  He is.

I have never heard of him, but when you pull his name up, it shows that he
is reporting to Mark Tawny, but is in the Research Group and being charged
to our cost center.  

He is also on our time site, but I have not been doing his time.  I hope 
somebody
has!

Let me know,

Hi Vince,
I have been working on and/or planning to work on the following projects:
1.  Finished a gas daily swing option model for commodity structuring 
group (Sanjeev Khanna).  The model uses American Monte Carlo 
Simulation and dynamic programming techniques. 

2. Continue working on PSIM model. This includes reading power generation
and operation books as well as thinking about ways to model power plant and
its operation. The standard approach (i.e. turn the plant on if power 
price>total
generation cost, else turn the plant off) is not particularly good if the 
regional
demand is very high and the plant still has some un-utilized generation 
capacity.
That is, the generation criteria is quite different depending on we model 
power 
plant from regional point view or from plant point of view.  Plan to have 
meetings
with Tom and Lance. 

3.  Started working on stochastic process parameter estimation.  I will 
concentrate
on four processes: GBM, mean reverting, jump diffusion, and jump diffusion 
with
mean reverting.  I have looked at Tanya's earlier  work and decided to 
discretize
the processes slightly differently.  It is hoped that this will give a more 
stable
estimation. 

Best,
Alex

Subject: Update / Event Time Change

Thanks to everyone for attending the meeting today! 

EVENT TIME CHANGE!!!
I just spoke with the Office of the Chairman and have learned that Ken and 
Jeff are actually available during the morning of December 19th from 8:00am 
until 11:00am.  As a result, our plans have changed just a little and I have 
requested whether or not they are willing to pose for Polaroid pictures with 
employees - I'll let you know what I find out!  We will still have the jazz 
duet and informational poster displays in the lobby throughout the day and 
instead of dessert items, we'll order breakfast stuff.

ASSIGNMENTS / BUDGET!!!!
Please note assignments below; for each team, collaborate between now and our 
next meeting to determine what purchases need to be made - budgets will be 
discussed at that meeting.  Again, it will be on Wednesday, December 6th from 
9:30am until 10:30am with the location TBD.

Vince, Anita and Kevin: 

I went to the dentist yesterday afternoon, and unfortunately, I am going to
have to have some oral surgery.

It is scheduled for 9:30 AM on Thursday the 21st of September, so I will 
probably 
be out the rest of the day.  Hopefully, I will return on Friday, the 22nd if 
all goes
well.

Just wanted to let you know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Good morning all:

Maureen Raymond Castaneda is officed in EB1939.  She has terrible migraine
headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on
having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed 
the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some
one may see that they are out and request they be replaced. 

I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch 
installed.

Please let me know.

Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038.

Thanks!

I shall talk to John Sherriff about such issues. My intention
is to vest you with maximum decision making powers. It makes most sense to
me to make decisions where the information resides.

Please, invite Anjam or alternatively make reservations for dinner and
let Shirley know. Shirley can send an invitation to everybody  in the group
on my behalf. It would be really bad to exclude Anjam from the dinner.

ask him, given our current relationship.

One other thing, have you had thoughts on reporting lines, who signs 
expenses, etc. etc., or are these issues to be resolved when you come over?

Hi Dawn:

The Research Group has moved around so much that we do not know
who to contact for accounting issues.  We need to reverse some money
back to one of the groups we are supporting, but do not know who to contact.
Do you have a clue?

We are also still using an SAP Corp. Co# and RC# because we do not
know where to go to get the new ENA #'s.

If you could help in this we would really appreciate it.

Thanks!

We will have to get him the L1 visa in order for him to work in the US.

I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project 
as a person
delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the L1 visa.

Subject: Re: Transition to Research Group - An Update  

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a 
project.     If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job 
description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.  

As for Sandeep, I have been told that he is a U.S. resident so there should 
be no problems with him.   Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be 
absolutely sure.

Thanks,

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a 
while
once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him 
longer,
given the priority of the project.

I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.

Thank you for the update, Vince.  I have been working with Margaret Daffin 
with regard to Anshuman's visa status.   We will have to get an L1 visa in 
place before he can come to the United States, even in a temporary 
capacity.    Do you  want to move forward with that effort at this time, or 
is the possibility of him coming to the U.S. so remote that it wouldn't be 
worth the time and money right now?

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here.

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,

Molly,

Giuseppe is finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford and worked for us last summer.   We would like to make him an offer to bring him as a manager.   Vince would like to offer $110 k base plus a $20k signing bonus and whatever would be the appropriate relocation package (He is single.).     He is leaving on Monday for Europe, so it would be preferable if we can get an offer letter in his hands by Friday or Saturday.    I have verbally given him this offer already, but told him that you would be the expert regarding what is covered in the relocation part.    He should be sending me his current address by email which I will forward to you a.s.a.p.

thanks,

Stinso, nice to hear from you. Things are going well here. The only
annoyance comes from the INS. I applied for curricular practical
training, and it will take about three months to have the work permit.
Receiving an H-1 takes understably much longer. Other than this, I would
like to know how are things in the research group and EBS.
I will leave for Italy next Monday and will stay there two weeks. I hope
to hear from you before my departure.

Our Spring/Fall window of "?nactivity"is rapidly eluding us...

We need to get our internal model operational without delay.

Along these lines, let's go ahead and plan your visit to Houston as soon as possible, 
but by all means get you in at least 4 weeks before hurricane season.

That would mean the month of May looks good.

Please inform me what duties you could not perform from here to support the Sydney office, 
we'll figure out how to keep that office whole.

(it's working without a hitch to have Steve Bennett in London, but continuing his Houston duties)

If the first week in May (for the whole month) will work, please respond asap and we'll get housing arrangements finalized.

Looking forward to your visit,

- - - Mike

Toni,
I spoke with Ben today and he is planning to pay for a trip to bring his
wife to Houston this weekend and show her around in hopes of overcoming her
hesitiation on moving.  His question is whether Enron will give him the time
to bring her down here and then give  an answer next week?  If you will let
me know how you, Grant, and Vince feel about that.

thanks,

Mike

Vince:  As you requested, I have obtained some information from Norma 
relating to the salary parameters of the Sr. Director position.   The minimum 
salary is $83,800, and the maximum is $168,000 (huge range, isn't it?).   
However, Norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention:  the 
lowest salary of a VP in your group is currently $140,000, and the average 
director's salary in your group is $120,000.    Those numbers narrow the 
range considerably.   Of course, there is no equity issue since there is no 
other senior director in your group.

Hope this information helps,
Molly

Elizabeth,

Can you please direct me to someone to assist us in making an offer to a 
young lady we just interviewed?  We would like to bring her in as a summer 
intern the same way that we brought in James Bradley Aimone.

She will be reporting to Stinson Gibner and I believe she is available right
away.

I am attaching her resume.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: "Enron Day" to be declared in Spearman, Texas

Cindy,

You may or may not remember that I sent a short note to you last May 
outlining a fundraising effort for the Hansford County Library in Spearman, 
Texas.   The community was challenged to raise $20,000 which I offered to 
match 2 to 1.   With Enron foundations employee match, this grows to a total 
mathching ratio of $4 for every $1 raised by the community.  (Of course, 
because of the $15,000/year limit, I have to spread my gifts over several 
years in order to get the total amount matched by Enron.)

Sherry Benton, the librarian in Spearman just called and gave me the great 
news that the $20,000 in community donations has been achieved.   In fact, I 
expect that the total community number will come to almost $25,000 once all 
of the donations are received.

In order to recognize our part in all this, the mayor of the town is planning 
to declare October 17th as "Stinson Gibner and Enron Day" in Spearman, and 
they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition.   
There will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and, 
possibly, by the Amarillo newspaper as well.    

They are asking if a representative from Enron (other than myself) would be 
interested in coming to Spearman for this event.    Please let me know if you 
or anyone else would be interested in doing this.    Spearman is about a 90 
minute drive north from the airport in Amarillo, and it is possible to get 
there and back to Houston on the same day.

Thanks,

Stinson Gibner

P.S. Is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $15,000/year 
matching cap so that I can have $40,000 matched in just two years instead of 
three?

Cindy,  

I just received notification of Enron's match of my $8000 donation to the 
Hansford County Library in Spearman, Texas.   (All old pipeline hands know 
Spearman because both Northern Natural and Transwestern pipelines run near by 
the city.)     

You may be interested to know what I am trying to accomplish there.  The 
Library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of Texas 
as it is owned neither by the county nor city.   It's budget is met through a 
combination of city, county, and private contributions.   A big part of their 
income comes from the "Thrift Shop,"   Spearman's version of the Blue Bird 
Circle.   In order to help the Library continue to provide quality services 
to the community (our library in Spearman, population 3000, is by all 
accounts much better than the one in nearby Perryton, population 15000),  I 
am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund.    We have set a 
goal of raising $100,000 over the next 3 years.   With Enron's matching, I am 
planning to provide about $80,000 of that amount with the other $20,000 
coming from contributions from others in the local community.

I am also investigating if the Library can get any type of matching grant 
from other foundations, but it looks like most prefer to fund specific 
projects rather than put funds towards endowments.    Let me know if you have 
any suggestions for us.


Thanks,

Stinson

Kevin,
If you guys had Aerons(mesh) and/or Vecta (Leather) chairs, my group 
typically will not be  responsible for the replacement of those chairs as I'm 
not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone. My group 
does not stock these chairs, therefore we order as requested by business 
units and charge your Co/RC. There will be two chairs delivered to the 
locations mentioned below, however, they will not be the Vecta or Aeron 
chairs.

You may want to contact Enron Security and maybe they can investigate further.

Thanks,
Reggie

We spoke regarding the chairs on Monday.
Please,  we need these chairs as soon as possible ,without being charged.
We paid for all new chairs each time we moved and it's not fair we pay again.

There may already be a request floating around for a standard black office 
chair for EB1972d.  It was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago.  In 
addition to that one, my own chair at EB3132A was stolen this past weekend.  
Could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us?

If you need to charge them to us, our numbers are 0011 and 100038.  As 
always, call me if you need to at x58322.

Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this 
year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

George-

Here's the story.

Research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for JAVA 
training by an outside person, weeklong classes for true Beginners and for 
those with decent programming experience in other languages (esp C++). Vince 
had pre-agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it. But, the response 
they got was so "overwhelming" they reconsidered, for financial reasons, and 
decided it would be better to just hire a Professor to teach a class for a 
week here. The costs would be around $15,000, and there should be room for 
around 15 people in the class. They have 6-8 people, and wonder if we might 
have some people who would want to do it (a no-brainer- JAVA is a big-time 
resume pad these days) and would be willing to share the costs with them. 
What is your opinion on this? Personally, I think it's a relatively 
inexpensive investment in our people, although, selfishly, it does increase 
their 'market value' so to speak. (Of course, nothing keeps Directors from 
going to the class as well :))

Clayton,

We can discuss your request  when I come back to the office on Monday.

Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an  explicit prior 
permission from your boss,
myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence.
In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.


Vince

Vasant-

I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered 
from the long flight back.

I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my 
intentions here at Enron.

Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged 
to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In 
addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on 
a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a 
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how 
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit 
purposes.

These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for 
which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines 
elucidating the structure of the data.

I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.

With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has 
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if 
the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been 
researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine 
will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be 
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is 
Compaq-specific.

I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.

I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not 
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the 
other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there 
wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In 
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power 
trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were 
ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they 
have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, 
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; 
during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to 
how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time 
data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with "well, we 
have it, but we haven't really tested it yet." An example is the weather: we 
still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES 
satellite.

My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only 
if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the 
Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the 
areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the 
Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people 
at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't 
directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, 
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.

As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting 
person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to 
George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are 
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their 
traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with 
Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were 
disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They 
also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid 
on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all 
work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but 
merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years 
as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a 
state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me 
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, 
including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to 
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I 
have learned here.

So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be 
a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you 
in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL 
database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their 
documentation.

As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, 
and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by 
email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data 
warehouse for floor trader support.

Clayton.

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

Molly,

We would like to bring this student as a summer intern (the last one,
we are running out of space).

I shall send you another message regarding his proposed dates.

Thanks. I hope you have a very Happy Easter.

Vince has asked that I forward the following:

************************************************************************

We will begin a seminar devoted to the book on "Energy 
Derivatives", written by Clewlow and Strickland, every first and 
third Friday of each month, beginning  January 19th.  Stinson 
Gibner has volunteered to act as the seminar coordinator.  

On January 19th only, the seminar will be held in EB30C1.   
Every session thereafter will be in EB49C1.  The seminar will be 
conducted like a "brown bag"  (everyone bring their own lunch).

The seminar is mandatory for every member of the group who 
started after January 1, 2000.   However, all other members of 
the group are invited to participate.

The books have been ordered and hopefully will arrive by the 
day of the first meeting.

Susan Kennedy and Judy Schlesinger (Order all of our subscriptions)
Demonica Lipscomb (Video Scheduling - should include Stuart)
Dave Delainey 
Mail Room 
Help Desk (Our Tech is:  Doug Doring)
Facilities Help Desk (don't know who)
Marriott (Trina - she takes care of all the Lunches we order)

I don't think we need to give the Ozarka guy one, we have several
who deliver down here, it is not always the same one.

Vince probably has more, I will let you know.

Goodmorning everyone ,

Last year we did quite a bit of Christmas baskets, during the time we were in 
the process of
another major move.
We are currently settled on all floors now , therefore our Christmas Basket 
List will be cut more than half.

Here are a list of the names that received baskets last year.

Matt Rodgers
Chris Hyde
Darren Prager

Charlie Notis
Harvey Freese
Jon Davis
Maryam Golnarghi



Delores Sustaita      Rodney Keys                  Iain

Guy                   Move -Team
 


Greg Whalley
Richard Weeks
Mary Sue Rose

There are several names boldly printed that probably will not receive the 
baskets this year.
The Christmas season is approaching therefore we must start preparing
.
Please note that I will be out on vacation Dec 13th -18th , if possible I 
would like your list of names
before my vacation begins whereby all baskets can arrive at their 
destinations on time.

Dinner on Sunday OK all round.  Do you want Anjam along too? I can't really 
ask him, given our current relationship.

One other thing, have you had thoughts on reporting lines, who signs

In the morning we were talking about the El Paso candidate who thinks he is 
above something and is not
willing to take certain project or responsibility.   In real life, we also 
occasionally have similar stiuation. (an
example is attached).

I would like to have your guidance when such a situation occurs.

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

Vince,

Thanks for the Tradespark article.  

I very much appreciate being able to participate in the Applied Learning 
projects.  It has been very stimulating for me.  I've really enjoyed all the 
projects I've worked on with the research group, and ever since my interview 
I have had plenty of second thoughts about going back to graduate school.  
I'm sure MIT will be a good and unique experience, but I wonder if it can 
help me find a job and a community I enjoy as much as I already have here.

If possible, I would like to talk with you and/or Stinson about the 
possibility of my staying on the research team, or coming back after the 
Fall.  

Thanks for your time.

Celeste,

Thanks a lot. Please, let us know whom you are willing to take based on the 
campus interviews,
and I shall absorb the overflow. My experience with the Teams 1 & 3 is that 
they are outstanding students
and we shall be able to offer them a fulfilling summer internship.

Last year we took 8 summer interns into research and all of them very happy 
with the program.

Vince

Subject: Hiring of Wharton Tiger Teams members for summer associate positions 
in Research

Vince:

Just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the Wharton 
Tiger Teams 1& 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer 
associate program.  You stated that you could take all members into your 
research group for the summer.  Kristin Gandy is now in the process of 
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the 
individuals on teams 1 & 3.  Some of these individuals may have interviewed 
with us during the campus process.  If they did and were turned down by the 
team for a summer position, we will not extend offers to those individuals.  
Otherwise, if you are willing to take the additional Tiger Team Members into 
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working 
with these students, then the Associate Program will facilitate those offers.

At mid summer and the end of the summer, these Wharton MBAs' performance will 
be evaluated and cross-calibrated with other summer associates to determine 
whether they receive an offer to join the full-time Associate Program.  
Offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high 
performance ratings.

As soon as Kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines 
which members did not already interview, she will get out both a verbal and 
offer to them.

As follow-up, Jana Giovannini, Manager of Staffing in Career Development, 
will staff those that accept our offer from this Tiger Team list into your 
group for the summer.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.

Thank you.

Molly,

I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project 
as a person
delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the L1 visa.

Subject: Re: Transition to Research Group - An Update  

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a 
project.     If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job 
description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.  

As for Sandeep, I have been told that he is a U.S. resident so there should 
be no problems with him.   Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be 
absolutely sure.

Thanks,

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a 
while
once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him 
longer,
given the priority of the project.

I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.

Thanks.

Thank you for the update, Vince.  I have been working with Margaret Daffin 
with regard to Anshuman's visa status.   We will have to get an L1 visa in 
place before he can come to the United States, even in a temporary 
capacity.    Do you  want to move forward with that effort at this time, or 
is the possibility of him coming to the U.S. so remote that it wouldn't be 
worth the time and money right now?

Molly,

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here. 

Vince

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here

due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Kevin,

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
aware of it, because I have
serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.

Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much.

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.
FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.

Vince:  I received a phone call yesterday afternoon from Iris, with a special 
request of you.  She says that she will have to break her lease when she 
comes to Houston.   She will have a three-month period during which she will 
have to pay rent (March, April and May), at the monthly rate of $1,175.  She 
is asking if we would be willing to pay $3,525 to compensate her for this 
extra expense.

I have a phone call in to the Relocation Department to find out how much cash 
Iris will be receiving from us under the normal relocation benefits, and will 
let you know as soon as I hear from them.  I would imagine that it is a 
fairly substantial amount, since she is moving from California and since our 
relocation benefit is very generous.

Jeff,

I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston.
I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next 
two years
until all the business problems are successfully resolved.

Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to
attack the Dhabol modeling challenge. He understands the Indian markets as 
well
as international fuel markets. He has also a very good grasp
of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power 
plant.

Subject: Help on DPC LNG Options

Vince,

This is a follow-up of our meeting with Jeff Shankman on Friday, as well as 
our discussions with the Global Assets Group on DPC issues.

As you see, there is a need for developing a comprehensive fuel strategy for 
DPC that encompasses both the LNG phase, and the naphtha side.  Furthermore, 
any fuel strategy we develop will have to be in consonance with the power 
side of the business.  There is a lot of analytical work that will be 
required in this context over the next several months, and we will need a 
person who understands both the power and the fuel side of the business at 
DPC.

I believe Anshuman is just such a person.  He has worked closely with me over 
the last 2 yrs., and has been trained in the derivatives side of the business 
(he has attended all three levels of Derivatives classes offered at Enron).  
Over the last month, his presence in Houston has greatly helped me in melding 
the Henwood study with the picture on the LNG/fuel side.  I believe his 
presence in Houston will be critical to us developing a comprehensive 
fuel/LNG strategy for Dabhol, together with the Global Markets and Asset  
groups.

I am therefore requesting you to explore the possibility of Anshuman being 
moved on a more permanent basis to Houston.  As you are aware, Anshuman 
himself would welcome such an arrangement.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Norma:  you are correct in that Sevil and I have spoken about her Green Card, 
and before we can proceed with this, we need to transfer her from the F1 visa 
to an HIB visa, which we will do later this year.

Sevil:  please contact me approx. June or July so that we can start the HIB 
process.
Thanks
Margaret

Subject: RE: green card

Sevil,

I believe you and Margret Daffin have spoken about the next steps for your 
Green Card.   You will need to start working on you HIB at the begining of 
October 2001.  

If there is any confusion on my part please let me know.

Norma Villarreal
X31545

Below is dicussion between Margret Daffin and Sevil in an e:mail January 26, 
2001:

"Sevil:  First of all we have to get you an HIB visa before we can work on 
getting you the Green Card.

After you get your OPT, contact me sometime in the summer and I will start 
working on your HIB visa which we will obtain in approx. October, 2001.  We 
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an F1 visa - you 
have to be on an HIB visa.  There is no rush - you will have six years on the 
HIB visa - plenty of time in which to get the Green Card."

This was in reference to her note to me, as follows:

"I think I'll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and 
opt. this makes almost two years. if we can start green card process now, do 
you think that I would get it before I need H1. In every case, can't we start 
green card before I get H1? Because I don't want to waste these two years 
given the fact that green card process is a long process."

Teresa,

It's OK to hire S. Tamarchenko as a summer temporary employee.
We need all the help we can get this summer.

I assume it will be 40 hrs a week, as long as ut conforms with all the

We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names 
and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me 
how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp 
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).  
Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore, 
they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001, 
which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call.  
Thanx.

With the new year,  we would like to institute some rules within the Research 
Group.  This applies to everybody in Research and is at the express request 
of Vince, but I am just sending it to my reports (and their reports) as of 
now.

People are expected to report to work in the morning around 8:00 am to 8:30 
am but NO LATER than 8:30 am.  This is primarily because our clients from 
other groups typically start calling around 8:00 am and we need to be 
responsive.  Of course, once in a while if something urgent comes up then 
this may be relaxed but you are responsible for letting both your supervisor 
and your assistant (Anita and/or Shirley) know in advance.

I am trying to come up with a schedule that will allow me to get updated on 
all the work that you guys are doing, and I will probably set this up next 
week after Vince finishes drawing up the overall directions for the group for 
2001.

Thanks,
Vasant

this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this, 
I will have the recruiter contact Shirley so Shirley can give us a job

Subject: Light Switch for EB 1939

Good morning all:

Maureen Raymond Castaneda is officed in EB1939.  She has terrible migraine
headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on
having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed 
the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some
one may see that they are out and request they be replaced. 

I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch 
installed.

Please let me know.

Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is 100038.

Thanks!

Good morning all:

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has "personal days", that, 
you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, 
sick child, etc.

I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is "no", but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over
with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed
two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.

If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),
please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an 
emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you 
are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.

These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral 
leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being 
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.  
These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by 
all of us.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Krishna, 

Attached is a spreadsheet with the figures we discussed earlier.  For 
July-Dec, ETS will keep half of the amount allocated (equivalent to 1.5 
employees, $135.6) from the corporate allocations to ETS.  If this looks OK 
to you, I would like to have Vera work with Shirley to handle the accounting 
adjustment similar to mid year.  Many thanks, Kim.


Vera,

Here is the Year 2000 spreadsheet.  As you will see, we will need to work 
with Shirley Crenshaw (X35290) with Enron Research Group to coordinate a 
similar accounting adjustment to the one we made mid year.  I will send the 
Year 2001 Budgeted spreadsheet to you in the next few days (just in case it 
changes with the approval of the science workorder).  Please call me if you 
have any questions about this spreadsheet.  Thanks, Kim.

Dear Vince & Grant,

Thanks very much for the offer to go to Houston as a Manager to work with 
Tanya Tamarchenko on VAR and credit risk within the Houston Research Group, 
as we discussed on the phone yesterday.  I felt that it would be useful to 
bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this 
morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in 
Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine 
from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an 
urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has 
kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of 
the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I 
expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign 
assignment representative in the near future.

I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to 
make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make 
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working 
with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in 
terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.  
The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron 
Corp is too dramatic and requires me to "burn bridges" and my return to Enron 
Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support 
structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs 
(flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely 
reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they 
justify making the contract a three year (local) one.

I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience & 
value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have 
identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an 
"Excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also 
"Excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my 
existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off 
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,

Anjam

Just because the A/A program does not have a contract does not mean
that Enron does not.  Do you have a telephone number for Melly's
and I will call them directly and ask her if she has a contract.

Vince,

The A/A program does not have a contract in place with Melly Language 
Services.  It appears that by the note below from my contact in the A/A-HR 
department, the reimbursement policy appears to be driven by department, not 
Enron at large.

As I mentioned earlier, if I continue with my current tutor, but outside of 
the Melly Language Services, the cost to the department will decrease for me 
to take French classes.

Pls advise if Research will be able to continue to fund my lessons.

Many thanks,

Gwyn Koepke

In the past the Associate & Analyst program use to pick-up the cost for the 
classes, but they stopped doing so effective 1/99.  (Although, some business 
units decided to continue paying for it - you may want to double check with 
your business unit to whether or not they have a contract.  The A/A dept does 
not.)   Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thank you for your patience.

Subject: A/A program question

Ivonne,

I am currently enrolled in a french language class thru Enron and Melly's 
Language Services, and my group is paying the cost directly.

I am considering quitting the Melly's Language Program in favor of an outside 
private tutor, for a number of reasons.  It will be cheaper too.

I would like to know:

1.  Does Enron have a contract in place with Melly's Language Service, to be 
the exclusive provider of language services to Enron?

2.  Will Enron pay the costs of my language classes if they are held outside 
of the Melly contract (if any)?

I just want to make sure that if I decide to "drop out" of the Melly classes 
and sign up for other private tutoring courses, which will be less expensive 
than the Melly Svc, that Enron will not have a problem picking up the tab.  
Vince Kaminski, the MD, wants to know this, to ensure there is no legal 
restriction on who must provide these language services in order to secure 
Enron reimbursement.

Thanks for your help.

Gwyn Koepke

Ranendra:  I have been asked to begin the visa process for the above 
individual, located in India.

I believe Mr. Shrivastava has been working as Assistant Manager with Enron 
since May 10, 1998.  If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into 
the US on an L1 intracompany visa under the Blanklet L for Enron.  

Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him 
the required visa questionnaire to begin the process.

Many thanks
Margaret

Hi Julie,

    It is so nice to hear from you.  I have had several conversations with 
the Houston compliance people regarding how to keep my SFA licenses current.  

     As per your request, I will respond to your questions in your email:

Subject: SFA Individual registrations

Iris

Your mails regarding SFA registration finally made their way to me, as I look 
after all Enron's individual registrations with the SFA.

At present, we are able to register overseas based individuals, although this 
may change towards the end of the year when the FSA takes over from the SFA 
as lead regulator in the UK.   


  I am sort of overseas.  However I will be spending some time in the London 
office (which is another reason why I don't want to lose my SFA 
designations).  As a matter of fact, I will be coming to London office in a 
week or two - and staying there for a while.   


There is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding how the FSA will implement 
individual registrations, but it has stated that anyone registered with the 
SFA at the point at which the FSA takes over, will be automatically 
'grandfathered' across to the new regulator.  Time will tell, what will 
happen thereafter.

What we need to do as far as your registration is concerned, is to submit a 
transfer form to the SFA to move your registration to Enron.  I shall put a 
form in the mail to you (please let me know where to send it) for signature 
and update of personal details.  

My Enron office address in Houston is as follows:
  Iris Mack
  Research Department
  1400 Smith Street, 1972d
  Houston, Texas  77002  USA  


As we have to submit the form to the SFA with original signatures, please 
return it to me at Enron House and I can get it authorised by our SFA 
compliance officer, Jonathan Marsh.  I will then inform you when I receive 
confirmation of your acc

Could you respond to the following by return e-mail;
name of the SFA regulated firm where you were last registered; 
 Banque Nationale de Paris Paribas at 10 Harewood Avenue in London 


date (approximation) when you left the above;
 August 2000

type of registration you held - please note we can only register you in the 
following registers; General Representative, Futures and Options 
Representative, Securities Representative or Corporate Finance Representative 
  I passed three exams:  Derivatives, Securities and Regulations 

The final question is whether you are going to be based in Houston 
permanently or whether you know at this stage if/when you will be returning 
to the UK. 

  Right now I will be spending time in both Houston and London.  See above 
explanation.





    Hopefully I have answered all your questions.  Please let me know if you 
require additional information.

Kind regards,
Iris  

Look forward to hearing from you

Best regards
Julie

Kevin,

Please, talk to Jeff Shankman's secretary about including all the Research 
Group members on
the 31st floor  in the company provided lunches (when they are available).

If an additional  lunch is needed from time to time, it's fine, but it should 
be seen as a something done
under exceptional circumstances.

Vince, Alice has strong qualities for a Sr Admin Asst.  Vince, have we posted 
this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this, 
I will have the recruiter contact Shirley so Shirley can give us a job 
description.  Then we can post and interview Anita simultaneously.  Please 
let me know ASAP if this has been posted.  Thanks.

Subject: Stephen Bennett


Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research=20
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment=
=20
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as =
a=20
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly =
an=20
"under hire."  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more =
of=20
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of=
=20
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "promotion.=
"

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20
designated as "Professional Meteorologist."  In fact, the most recent simil=
ar=20
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist=
,=20
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While=
=20
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin=
al=20
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected=
=20
at this time.

Although a "new-hire" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro=
n=20
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager=
=20
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather=
=20
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio=
n=20
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly=
=20
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a=
=20
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  =
He=20
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research=
=20
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather=
=20
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and=
=20
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion=
=20
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg=
ular=20
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail=
,=20
to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.  Recently, with the=
=20
advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntaril=
y=20
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As hi=
s=20
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I d=
o=20
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations=20
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was=
=20
Enron=01,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - =
a=20
meteorologist, coupled with Stephen=01,s desire to work for our company in =
spite=20
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professiona=
l=20
title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly=
=20
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving=
=20
of this immediate and retroactive promotion.

Dear everyone,=20

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working=
=20
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all=
=20
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find=
=20
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,=
=20
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep=
=20
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, le=
t=20
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of=
=20
this group.=20

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag=
=20
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. =
=20
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20
technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that w=
e do=20
not have to reinvent the wheels. =20

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us wil=
l=20
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from=
=20
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing=
,=20
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything=
=20
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have=
=20
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20
presentation style.  It could be =20
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style=
=20
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon th=
e=20
responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin o=

Thanks. Shirley is checking my calendar and will call you about the schedule.
The entire week of the 11th does not look good for me.

Vince,

Just wanted to check with you to see if you have a preference as to when you would like to have your mid-year PRC meeting.  If you and your team are available, I would prefer to have it on either June 12th, 13th or 14th.  I am very flexible though, so please just let me know so that I can start making the necessary accommodations.

Thanks,
Anne

Sheila,

I am forwarding you a message I received a few days ago. I want to ask you 
for advice how to handle this case.

My first  reaction was to ignore it. The longer I think about it, the more 
convinced I become that some action 
is required.

Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a 
female employee
was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months 
later about
the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar 
cases, courts  subsequently 
found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such 
complaints.

The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is 
immaterial. 
If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double 
standard in
handling sexual harassment cases.

My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and 
sexual harassment prevention class.

Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.


Vince

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

Hello Norma:

In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information.

There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research
list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she
is shown as an "Adm Coord".  This was done so that she could be considered
non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst.

Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again
and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Stinson,

As you requested, I spoke with Brad McSherry concerning the position, salary, 
and immediate supervisor. I asked Brad to provide a formal letter of offer 
and informed him that I needed it before the end of business Friday. 
Unfortunately, I have not received the letter thus far. Although the job was 
well defined, I felt that the administrative details of the position were not 
clearly laid out. For example, I specifically asked last week who my manager 
would be and was told that it would be you. However, I later found out (by 
chance) that this was not the case. Also, it was unclear whether I would be 
in the research group or in Enron communications. 
Although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances 
would be resolved, given previous confusion regarding my role and 
compensation with the research group, I feel less comfortable accepting the 
position. To be specific, there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my 
interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus. In 
general I feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and 
respect.
Therefore I feel that I am left with the decision not to make the move to 
Enron and feel that it would be in everyone's best interest not to pursue 
this any further. Thank you.

-Samer


[Brad, as I indicated on Friday please do NOT perform any kind of transfer. 
Thanks.]

Hi,

     Thanks for the Fed Ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent
information about Enron.

     I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of
other forms.  You should receive these documents via Fed Ex on tomorrow
morning.

     Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in California, I won't
be able to start until March 1st.  I hope that is okay.

     Thanks so much.

Regards,
Iris

Sevil,

I believe you and Margret Daffin have spoken about the next steps for your 
Green Card.   You will need to start working on you HIB at the begining of 
October 2001.  

If there is any confusion on my part please let me know.

Norma Villarreal
X31545

Below is dicussion between Margret Daffin and Sevil in an e:mail January 26, 
2001:

"Sevil:  First of all we have to get you an HIB visa before we can work on 
getting you the Green Card.

After you get your OPT, contact me sometime in the summer and I will start 
working on your HIB visa which we will obtain in approx. October, 2001.  We 
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an F1 visa - you 
have to be on an HIB visa.  There is no rush - you will have six years on the 
HIB visa - plenty of time in which to get the Green Card."

This was in reference to her note to me, as follows:

"I think I'll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and 
opt. this makes almost two years. if we can start green card process now, do 
you think that I would get it before I need H1. In every case, can't we start 
green card before I get H1? Because I don't want to waste these two years 
given the fact that green card process is a long process."

Molly:  for your information, I received this reply from Anshuman today.

As I mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from Neil 
McGregor, there is no possible way that Anshuman could be in the US to work 
on February 5th.  Until I receive all of his documents, and the necessary 
information from you regarding his position in the US, I do not have the 
information to send to the attorneys for the visa application.

Once they receive the paperwork, they will need to prepare the documents in 
triplicate, and send to me.  At this stage, I will send the documents to 
Anshuman in India and he will need to make an appointment at the US Consulate 
in order to have the L1 visa stamped into his passport.  He will not be able 
to come to the States to work without this visa in his passport!  All of this 
could take approx. 3-4 weeks to accomplish.  I think March would be a more 
realistic timeframe!

Please let me have your thoughts.
Thanks

Margaret

Subject: rotational opportunities within your group

Dear Vince,

I am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities 
within your group. I have worked in RAC and am currently in Financial 
Trading. I believe the Associate/Analyst program may forward you my CV, but I 
thought it good to get in touch personally. 
Please let me know if there is someone with whom I could speak about the 
group and its needs for associates. 

With best regards,
Kate

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor 
or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal 
customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that 
Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but 
have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I 
hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I 
just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through 
Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your 
expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

EVENT TIME CHANGE!!!
I just spoke with the Office of the Chairman and have learned that Ken and 
Jeff are actually available during the morning of December 19th from 8:00am 
until 11:00am.  As a result, our plans have changed just a little and I have 
requested whether or not they are willing to pose for Polaroid pictures with 
employees - I'll let you know what I find out!  We will still have the jazz 
duet and informational poster displays in the lobby throughout the day and 
instead of dessert items, we'll order breakfast stuff.

ASSIGNMENTS / BUDGET!!!!
Please note assignments below; for each team, collaborate between now and our 
next meeting to determine what purchases need to be made - budgets will be 
discussed at that meeting.  Again, it will be on Wednesday, December 6th from 
9:30am until 10:30am with the location TBD.

As we discussed earlier, I attached the copy of the petition for my summer 
internship with Enron Analyst and Associate group.
I also have the hard copy of the letter, which I will deliver to you 
presonally.

I am looking forward to, finally, become an official Enron employee.  Thank 
you very much for your valuable contributions to
my experience with the company.

Hello everyone:

Attached is the churn relocation request for some office exchanges within 
the Research group on the 19th Floor.  I have grouped them in sets of two
which are the exchanges.

This is a very RUSH order.  We would appreciate your getting to this as
soon as possible - the 15th of August would be great, if possible.

Let me know if there is something that you do not understand.  Thanks!

Shirley

Osman,

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.

I had a message on my phone this morning from WIlliam indicating that
he had changed his mind and will be taking another job. He also mentions that
the other organization will give him time to publish his  thesis and he assumes 
Enron would not do that.

I am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so.

Hi Shirley &  Vince:

 Happy New Year! I am in our Bombay offices for a couple of days, so am able 
to contact you. For some reason, the modem dialup from my computer hasn't 
been working. Hope everything is going well in Houston. Anitha & I have  good 
news. We are having our second baby. It was confirmed after we came to India. 

Shirley, I have a favor to ask you on this matter. Can you make an 
appointment for Anitha with her doctor? The details are as follows:

Dr.  Dolar Patolia 
Tel:  713-756-5500
Name:  Anitha Kakani
Dates:  Jan 29th or 31st. 
Times:  In order of preferance, after 3PM, 12-3PM, 10AM-12Noon. 
Reason: Pregnant with due date of Aug 8th. Needs a full checkup.

Anitha is having severe nausea, so she is taking rest most of the time. 
Pallavi and I are enjoing our vacation thoroughly. 

Thanks and best wishes,
Krishna.
Ph. 011-91-40-7114833

Tani Nath who heads up the Structuring and Research teams rang this morning 
to get more information on Tony.

Can you tell me who he reports to in Houston and whether that person will 
continue to manage him remotely?

What cost centre he should be charged to ? whose headcount he appears on, and 
for what group he will be providing services for, Tani was unsure on all of 
the above and wants clarification.

Hi

Tony is a UK employee who starts next Monday 12th March 2001, we have done a 
quick start in Nest today for him.

Tony will be working his first month in the Houston office, however we still 
need to set up a log on and notes account here. 

Can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to Kevin as he 
will be meeting with Tony on Monday morning in the Houston office.

Tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in 
approximately a month so no actual PC is necessary until then. 

One question - with a UK log on and notes account, will Tony be able to 
access these from Houston? if it's complicated can you please let Kevin know 
how to do this. 

any problems let me know

thanks

Desleigh

Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

I have some concerns regarding Vernon being able to transfer even if he is 
temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him.  According to Enron 
policy, an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or 
better.  This is to prevent  problem employees  being moved from one 
organization to the another.  This sounds like a "work ethic" issue to me and 
the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he 
is temporarily successful.  But if Kevin Presto knows the situation and he 
still wants Vernon in the end, I will push for an exception as this satisfies 
our obligation to be forthright.  Please keep me informed of Clayton's 
progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem 
employee.  Thanks. 

Sheila

Kevin,

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
aware of it, because I have
serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.

Chonawee: Further to our telephone conversation this morning, I am attaching 
a visa questionnaire that I need you to complete and return to me 
immediately, together with the documents listed at the bottom of the form.

As explained, I will send everything to our attorney's office in the hope 
that they can file for the H-IB prior to reaching the cap, but in the event 
this does not go through, your H-IB will not be available until October, 
2000.  As your OPT does not expire until November 1, 2000, we will still have 
the opportunity to get you an H-IB before your OPT runs out.

Please bring these documents to me in EB3694.

Vince,
I had a lunch meeting with Rudi and Vladi from RAC, and I also met with Ted 
Murphy.
They are supposed to get back with me by Friday to confirm the proposed 
summer rotation.

So far I have a very positive impression of the group, and the projects that 
they are involved in.
They also told me that RAC and Research people are often working on projects 
together, so I am sure that my ties with Research are not going to go away 
with me rotating to RAC.

I will keep you posted on further developments.

Coordially,

Jason Sokolov

Vince,

Last Monday, I sent the VP's an e-mail asking for their help (from them, or 
from one of the people working with them) in providing a Technical Corner 
article by today.  To date, Sandeep and Mike have responded but cannot do one 
for this coming week.  I didn't get a response from the other three.  Do you 
have something that could be easily adapted for the Monday issue?

And, any suggestions about how to motivate a VP would be appreciated.  My 
usual approach is to ask politely, which usually gets a positive response.  I 
know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work, but surely as 
much as our people like to publish their ideas, one person out of 
forty-some-odd would be able to do something in a week's time, right?

As always, I appreciate your help.  And, if you would care to share some 
advice on how I can do this in a better way, I will always listen and learn.

Sam

Hi Samer!

Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving!

I found out the "scoop" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non-
refundable tickets cannot be transferred.  It was just your seat that
Maureen's husband used. 

I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50.
The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
the check from us.

Sorry for the confusion!

Cheers!

Shirley

Shirley,
How are you? Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in;
this process seems to be taking forever.
I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from
American Express related to my Enron account. The charge amount is $330.50,
which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the Travel
Agency in the Park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was
supposed to have used to fly to Colorado. However, the ticket was used by
Maurine's husband and Maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, I
remember calling the TAP and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you
help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to
pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected.
I appreciate your help. Thanks.
-Samer

Hello everyone:

Vince has asked me to send the following as a reminder:

******************************************************************************
****************

This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for
cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enron
a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.

Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch 
boxes
on the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that 
your mothers 
don't work here.

Vince

Dear Tanya,

Thank you very much for the offer.

Basically, I can start at anytime if the condition is acceptable.

Currently I'm in the middle of a decision that I can extend my internship or
accept a job offer at here. But I think that decision should be done soon
since my original internship expires this week. So the exact time to start
work at Enron depends on how quickly I can get your official offer including
employment condition.

I hope this will help to your question. If you have any question on me, please
feel free to contact me.

Again, I appreciate your decision.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Hi Vanessa:

You will need to fill out a "Churn Request" and forward it to the "Move Team"
they will take care of everything that you put on the form.  I am attaching a 
copy 
of the form for your information.  The receiving department is responsible 
for 
doing this.  He will need boxes to pack his belongings (ask him how many 
he needs - he will have to do the packing).  The only item that moves other
than his personal items, is his telephone.  The computer, chair, etc.  
belongs to 
the Research Group.

If you have any questions, or need help, please let me know.

Thanks!

Hello, Vince!

I was planning to stop by Damian's this evening, but I think I'll go home 
instead.  I've contracted a sneezy cold, and I don't want to spread it around 
anymore than I already have.  

Thank you for putting this together.  I'll have to make the one in January 
for sure!

Geynille,

I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH. I am forwarding to 
you the resume 
of one of the students  of the University of Houston.

She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was 
most
impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude. I used
to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am
still helping their local chapter.

As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.

Shelly,

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed 
up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Margaret,

Thanks for reminding me this issue. I think I'll be fine until I start full 
time here in the research group. As you know right now I am using curricular 
practical training as work permission. And until I graduate I am allowed do 
as many as part time CPT I want to do. Because of tax purposes I think I'll 
use this right given to me. In this case, what I need to do is that after I 
and Vince make sure about my full time start date (this may happen in the 
beginning of 2002), I'll let you know and send you the necessary document you 
require to initiate my H1B visa application process. Thanks again.

Sevil,

Hi Paul and Anad, please make the appropriate arrangements (via Enron Corp. 
AA pool) to "rotate" Martin Lin into my group. As you know, I am heading up 
the EBS research unit that is reporting to Vince Kaminski and Stinson Gibner 
(MD & VP of Enron Research Group, respectively).  Martin will work for Jim 
Irvine and report to him on a day-to-day basis.  Martin will spend most of 
his time at Jim's office location.  This arrangement is very similar to Samar 
Khleif's role in Portland with John McClain's broadband delivery group.  

Martin has already discussed his rotation with Jim Irvine and scheduled to 
start on March 1, 00.   EBS Research will be working very closely with Jim 
Irvine and John Griebling in the area of Network Planning and Model 
Development (Traffic Engineering in telecom-speak).  Martin has a Ph.D. in 
Electrical Engineering and has been working within Research supporting 
electricity transmission analysis and modeling.

Regards,

Ravi.

Tony,

Earl Harvey and I are located on the 19th floor inside the Corporate Research
Group's area, which is in a secured area.  They are a very supportive and
cooperative group, and conditions here are ideal for research, analysis, and
writing.  I don't want to jeopardize their security in any way, but, if
possible, I would like to be added to the after hours and weekend access list
for situations such as meeting deadlines and research & development.

The Research Group's director is Vince Kaminski (Ext. 3-3848) and Shirley
Crenshaw (Ext. 3-5290) is the group's administrative coordinator.  Their
security procedures require that Mr. Kaminski authorize Shirley to add people 
to
the access list.  If you concur with my request, could you please extend the
request to Mr. Kaminski?

I have discussed my request with Shirley and am copying her with this memo, 
but
I didn't want to copy Mr. Kaminski because I believe that you would see that 
as
your responsibility; and that if you did not concur with my request, then 
there
would be no reason to copy him at all.

Thanks,

JAY

I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the 
call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying to 
conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I 
mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me 
compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to 
quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent 
information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in 
many extra hours to help us out on this project.

I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.

Regards,

Craig

Stinson,

I am going to do the PRC review for Bob and Paulo.
If your time permits, please join me for these two meetings.

Bob:     9:00 am

Paulo: 10:00 am

I attended the PRC training, they suggested letting employees
read their review before the meeting.  So I did that.  Here are the
two files attached.

Anita, the other day I called you to get Jason Sokolov's cost center.  Some 
of his EIS expenses (market data, long distance) for Jan and Feb 2001 were 
charged to the Enron Corp. RAC cost center.  In order for our accountants to 
reclass the expenses, we need your approval that the expenses can be moved.  

If this is okay, just reply back and let me know.

See the attached files for the detail of the expenses to be moved for Jan and 
Feb.


Thanks for your help,
Kevin

Vince, Alice has strong qualities for a Sr Admin Asst.  Vince, have we posted 
this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this, 
I will have the recruiter contact Shirley so Shirley can give us a job

Dear Vince:
?
After a very great deal of thought, I have decided  to stick it out with El 
Paso. 
?
Please be assured that this exercise was not a  "fishing expedition" to 
extract concessions from El Paso.? Rather, it is  simply that, although I 
continue to harbor doubts about some of El Paso's  methods and about the 
people running the business, I have concluded that two  months is not enough 
time to fully judge the company.? I feel that I have  not yet given El Paso 
(or myself for that matter) a fair chance.? After  all, if I disagree with 
the way the business is run, I should regard that as an  opportunity to 
effect changes and not an excuse to run away.
?
Please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to  all those who worked so 
hard over the holidays to produce the offer: David  Oxley, Sheila Walton, and 
especially Norma Villarreal.
?
And thanks also to you Vince for your patience,  humor, and good advice.? As 
I've said before, I consider it an honor to be  able to call you a colleague 
and friend.
?
With Best  Regards,
Grant.

Hello everyone:

Well it is almost that time again!  I am going to try something different.  I 
am
forwarding you the time sheet by email.  Save the document to whatever
drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you 
had 
and return to me by email.   I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31st) of 
each
month.

This may work better than hand delivering.

Let me know what you think.

Try to reduce the number of potential candidates to 3, before I shall

Also, I contacted HR regarding your promotion.

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire 
an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to 
get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before 
I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you 
that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or 
associate economist level.

Thank you.

this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this,

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

Vince:

Is the following all right to send to the group?

******************************************************************************
********
Good morning all:

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has "personal days", that, 
you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, 
sick child, etc.

I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is "no", but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over
with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed
two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.

If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),
please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an 
emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you 
are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.

These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral 
leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being 
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.  
These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by 
all of us.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Shirley

asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

Hi Louis:

We will have several employees from the London office coming to Houston
this summer (they will be rotating) beginning 7/31/00.  Can we get a parking
space at 777 Clay for them?  We only need one for 7/31/00 - 11/30/00 (4 
months).

The other alternative would be the stickers for Allen Center.  Do you still 
have
them?  

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Molly,

Giuseppe is finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford and worked for us last summer.   
We would like to make him an offer to bring him as a manager.   Vince would 
like to offer $110 k base plus a $20k signing bonus and whatever would be the 
appropriate relocation package (He is single.).     He is leaving on Monday 
for Europe, so it would be preferable if we can get an offer letter in his 
hands by Friday or Saturday.    I have verbally given him this offer already, 
but told him that you would be the expert regarding what is covered in the 
relocation part.    He should be sending me his current address by email 
which I will forward to you a.s.a.p.

thanks,

Stinson

P.S.   Regarding Jinbaek.  We would be happy to pay his air ticket.

Stinso, nice to hear from you. Things are going well here. The only
annoyance comes from the INS. I applied for curricular practical
training, and it will take about three months to have the work permit.
Receiving an H-1 takes understably much longer. Other than this, I would
like to know how are things in the research group and EBS.
I will leave for Italy next Monday and will stay there two weeks. I hope
to hear from you before my departure.

We have been working the last few days to get ENA's United Way participation 
rate up as high as possible.  I called earlier about your Cost Center because 
the following 16 employees were listed in Power Trading, but I believe are 
part of the Research organization.

If you have a chance, could you encourage them to log onto 
http://unitedway.enron.com on the intranet and make a contribution to the 
United Way.  The deadline is today.

Thanks.

Eric

Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Vince,

We would like to continue to receive the IIF service for a cost to the 
Research Group of $15,000 per annum.  Can I ask you to approve this charge?  
Please let me know if you'd like to discuss.  We decided to cancel the Oxford 
Analytica service (daily country briefs and access to the website) as we are 
getting consensus forecasts for FX and inflation from another source, so we 
will not be subject to the $10,000 fee referenced below. 

Thanks,

Gwyn

Subject: IIF/OxAn

Hi Maureen and Gwyn-

On the Oxford Analytica front, I'm glad you have found the service useful.  
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more 
users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per 
year.  We can charge $10K back to you.

On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here 
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of 
our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.

Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of 
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I 
need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.

Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on 
your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our 
colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and 
John Sherriff on that project from London.

RJ

invite to the going away party.

Ted Murphy
George Hopley
Bernie Aucoin
Edith Cross
Vlady Gorny
Naveen Andrews
Debbie Brackett.

The above are the essentials.  I also like to invite the following, but I
recognize that Vince may want to control costs, so I will leave it up to you
and him to invite or not.

Bill Bradford
Jim Simpson (structuring, works for Bernie)
Rudi Zipter
Greg Woulfe (EBS trader, not a Portland marketer!)
Scott Tholan
Kevin Golden
Rebecca ???  (works with Vlady).

I will also try to invite Terry Lohrenz unless instructed not to.

Give me a call at home if you have questions.

Regards,
Grant.

Hello everyone!

Not very many of you have filled out your timesheet in the excel spreadsheet

If you cannot access the "O" drive. you will need to fill out one by hand 
until
you can get access.

Whichever way - I need them today!!

Thanks!

Subject: Rollover of my vacation days to 2001

Vince:
 I would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of 
this year to 2001. I could not use us all of my available vacation this year 
because of the following reasons:

1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron 
India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects 
that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business 
knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron.

2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I 
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. 
Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them 
didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in 
recruiting, training and mentoring.

3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a 
business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I 
could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an 
extended period of time.

So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a 
result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to 
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. 

Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to 
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year.

Thank you,
Krishna.

Iris:

I forwarded the information to Donna Lowry in our Compliance Dept.  However,
I am afraid she had bad news.  

Enron would sponsor the renewals, but the US Securities group does not
recognize UK Securities exams without further testing here in the US.

She said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail.  But,
from what I understand, you will need to take some exam here before renewing.

When you hear from her let me know.

Dear all:

A few words about Tom.  He is a power engineer type who has previously worked 
at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including 
asset planning and hydro scheduling.  He was hired by EI Structuring to 
oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent 
implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he 
is looking for a new home. He has some  finance background  from having to 
do  asset evaluation for utility rate filings.  He has almost no options 
experience.  He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR 
problems.  

Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to 
see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects.  
And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine.

This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore 
the formalities of such a transfer.


Thanks,
Grant.

However, without some type of job offer in the US, we cannot move forward

Toni:

We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.

Grant.

My supervising professors from UT and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that

1.  Should I submit it with my affiliation as The University of Texas at

2.  What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?

A draft of the paper for your review is attached.

Hi Niclas,

I am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now, so it might be 
more productive to speak by phone (503-464-8430).  Please leave your number, 
if you get my voicemail.

To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS 
database of plant forced and planned availability.  It seems others in 
Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your 
disposal.  The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR 
available for free (http://www.nerc.com/~esd/).  I know Alexios in RE/EES has 
this.  If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access 
the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.  It 
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you 
could aggregate up.

The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place 
to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious 
"self-reporting" error.  It is available in pdf form from the web site 
http://www.wscc.com/.  Other sources that should be more near-term, but more 
accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the 
BPA Whitebook (http://www.transmission.bpa.gov).

As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the 
reported utility forecasts for loads, or you can go to fundamental data.  The 
ultimate source of the census data collected by the US Dept of Commerce, 
which you can buy on CDROM for cheap.  It would have this kind of information 
by SIC code, by ZIP code.  You may also have access to one of the economic 
forecasting businesses (Wharton's WEFA, DRI, etc.)  They have this in highly 
digested and complete form.

BTW, Tim Heizenrader, who runs Fundamental Analysis and Research on the West 
Desk, is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control.  Is your 
client aware of this resource?

Give me a buzz and we can talk more,
Michael

>>> Niclas Egmar/HOU/EES@ENRON 08/14/00 12:49PM >>>
Michael,

I'm an analyst in the research group. I would like your help with finding 
some information specific for the West Coast. A new analyst on the West Power 
desk needs information on planned outages and planned new generation. He is 
studying the long-term fundamentals of electricity volatility on the West 
Coastso so he also needs info on housing starts, computer sales or industrial 
production figures for computer manufacturing, growth of start-up companies, 
and population stats.

Any help in finding the needed info would be greatly appreciated. Contact me 
or Daniel Kang (new analyst).

Vince,
I just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the 
computer system
(it says that I have 0 C/over days).

It was November 3, 1999 when I asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation 
days to the next year .
I was thinking that if you (or HR) do not approve I could at least take these 
days in 1999. 

I know that your tried to help me and sent to  Brad McSherry the 
justification for me to carry over 10 days.
I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your 
response was optimistic
I did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.

Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake. 
I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/00 to 3/17/00).

What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response 
from HR in November or
December last year would be better than loosing vacation days.

I really appreciate your help,
Tanya.

Hi, Vince,
sorry to bother again with my question.

I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).

Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry 
over my 10  vacation days to the next year? 
If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations 
anyhow. I would really prefer not to take off
most of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.

Thank you for your help in resolving this question.

Tanya.

Grant and Vincent can handle urgent matters while I am away.

Vince-

I know you're very busy, so you might not have heard this ...

Apparently, the Board will meet this week to approve the sale of *all* of 
Enron International's assets to a member of hte Saudi royal family, the same 
Prince who once invested heavily in Citicorp to bail it out.

The source of this is someone I trust.

Norma,

Thanks for your mesage.

1. I shall ask Krishna to reduce his rollover to 40 hrs.

2. Any resolution on bonus for Lance (October 2nd start)?
    Anita Dupont is in the same situation.

3. Can you send me a copy of exit interview for Grant Masson?
    There is a special reason I need and I shall explain it to you in
     person.

4. What time next week would be good for lunch? I would be glad 
to invite you Molly and Ramona. What about Friday the 22nd?

Hi Reggie:

Conference Room EB 19C2 is in need of a round black table to hold the
telephone.  Is there one available?

Also we would like a two-drawer lateral file cabinet for EB 19C2.

Hi, Grant,

How are you?  Hope everything is going well.

My wedding ceremony was very good but the whole
process is more complex than I expected.  It might
take several more days.  So I am wondering, if it is
not too much a trouble for you, I would like to extend
my vacation several more days.  Please let me know.

Best regards,

Vincent

Vince,

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding the action items that were 
taken away from yesterday's meeting with you, Mike Roberts, Norma, and myself.

1)  Tony Hamilton
As you know Tony's official start date was March 12, 2001, and he has yet to 
receive a paycheck.  London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and 
they only get paid on the 20th of each month.  Tony did not receive a 
paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put 
into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to 
receive a check on the 20th.  Consequently, Tony will not receive his first 
paycheck until April 20th.  If you would like for me to try and work with the 
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please 
let me know.

2)  Joe Carson
>From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer 
that consisted of a one-year contract.  However, Gary is out of town until 
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal.  Would you like me 
to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for 
me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.

I look forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

you and Krishna informed of the timing and location of the move.  I will also

Hi Kim,

I don't see any problem. For the time being, he can keep his desk on the 19th 
floor as
well ( and the same phone number). It will be helpful when he has to work 
closely with Krishna
under time constraint.

At some point, as we hire more people and run out of space, we can move him 
completely to
your floor.

Please, ask your assistant to call Shirley and arrange the move.

Hi Vince!  

I hope you and a nice Christmas and New Year!  It's nice to be back and in 
the full swing of the new year.  

I have a question for you.  I spoke with Krishna prior to him leaving for 
India about the possibility of moving Youyi up to our floor so that we can 
work closer with him.  Krishna thought that this would be a good idea.   It 
would be great to have Youyi with us soon so that he will be intimately 
involved with the whole approach of our prototype model.  Although Krishna 
will be back at the end of the month, would you mind if I speak with Youyi 
and begin the paperwork for moving him onto our floor?  I'm not sure if 
Krishna has mentioned this to Youyi yet.  I did not want to surprise anyone 
and wanted to run this by you or Krishna for final approval.  

Many thanks, Kim.

In the morning we were talking about the El Paso candidate who thinks he is above something and is not
willing to take certain project or responsibility.   In real life, we also occasionally have similar stiuation. (an
example is attached).

I would like to have your guidance when such a situation occurs.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Per my voice mail to Vince, Martin Lins offer letter will be provided to him 
on Thursday, August 31, 2000. 

However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally 
discussed.  Therefore, based on his PHD and market information we are able to 
offer him a base salary of 98-100K and no retention bonus.  We can discuss 
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me.  Otherwise, 
please approve salary structure of base 98,000 with no bonus.

Thank you.

This is just a short reminder about the four letters of recommendation. 

I have attached an envelope with each recommendation. Once you 
seal each envelope, please don't forget to sign it (over the adhesive 
seal) and to label the front, e.g. "Columbia - Joseph Hrgvocic". Also, 
I will be mailing everything in one package to each university, so

That is all. As always, I really do appreciate the time you're taking to

Back in November of last year, you have indicated that 40% of the 17.5% (40% 
of 17.5 is 7%) that we are allocating to EGM should be billed to Gary 
Hickson's group.  Gary is asking for further broken down of this 40% to his 
world.  Can you check with Vince to see what portion of the 7% should be 
charged to Equity Trading, Rate & Currency Trading, Agricultural Trading & 
Origination and Convertible trading?  And can I get this information back by 
the end of this week because we are going to start closing on Friday.  If you 
have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
Overdyke),
oil trading and coal.

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research

Vince said to allocate it as follows:

Gary Hickerson  40%

Hope this helps!

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

Stephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research=20
group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment=
=20
criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as =
a=20
Senior Specialist.

After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly =
an=20
"under hire."  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more =
of=20
a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of=
=20
this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring=20
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "promotion.=
"

At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron=20
designated as "Professional Meteorologist."  In fact, the most recent simil=
ar=20
hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist=
,=20
who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While=
=20
functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job=20
classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional=20
professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the=20
proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This origin=
al=20
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist=20
category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected=
=20
at this time.

Although a "new-hire" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work=20
experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the=20
Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in=20
Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations,=20
needing no further training and only minimal supervision.

Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enro=
n=20
values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed=20
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager=
=20
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather=
=20
briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparatio=
n=20
as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly=
=20
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a=
=20
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through=20
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.

Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  =
He=20
designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research=
=20
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather=
=20
derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and=
=20
liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion=
=20
and major upgrade of this web page.

These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen=01,s reg=
ular=20
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail=
,=20
to assemble and prepare our trader=01,s weather report.  Recently, with the=

advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntaril=
y=20
on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As hi=
s=20
supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I d=
o=20
not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations=20
assistance.

In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was=

Enron=01,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - =

of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professiona=

of this immediate and retroactive promotion.

Hi,

I'd like to thank you for the opportunity of letting me work here this 
summer.  I've learned a lot in the past three months and hopefully have been 
of some help around here.  I was very impressed with this department, and 
Enron itself, and I really appreciate the chance for me to have worked in 
such an environment.

So anyway, thank you and I wish you and the department well,

Brad

Jeff,

I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at a VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
a support of three senior executives.

I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview
or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma 
Villarreal at H/R.

Thanks.

Chonawee,

This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage
the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) 
on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation
of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s
convictions.

Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only
way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the
company) is by having open communication.  In Enron,
facts are friendly.

By the way, it was an excellent presentation.

Vince

Subject: Sorry.

Hi Vince, I am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions. 
Vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same 
expected revenue to the auctioneer. (Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, 
and second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the 
valuation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, 
everyone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of 
the second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation 
bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the 
winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder.
Thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions.

Grant,  I did talk with Tanya this evening however since I'm on vacation 
Friday I wanted to outline here what Rabi has discussed with me.

1)  Title.....he is currently at a VP level and we are offering him Manager
2)  Sign on Bonus...........the 15K is not coving the lost bonus he will 
receive at he current co ($25K)
3)  Salary...........he will receive a "Risk Premium" of approx 10% befor 
tax.   He is not able to quantify this for us and I was not able to get a 
number out of him as to what he is looking for.  

He is very enthusiastic and wants to work for Enron but wanted to see if we 
could do anything to enhance our offer in these areas.

Hello Everyone ,

Starting Today , 2/22/00  Mike Roberts signed a expense report.

Vince, I need to know from you if this is okay and do you want to see
them ?

Also Shirley , if Mike signs for anything else other than a expense report ,
 I will pass it by your desk whereby you can know exactly what it is.

Vince,
 Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two 
groups that a subscription to the "Institute for International Finance" is 
worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the 
cost.  Is a $16K share OK for your group?  We'll do $32K on our end, and then 
try and sell some of our share to my European counterpart once he gets better 
established with a bigger budget.

Thanks for itemizing the costs.  We have decided to cancel the Oxford 
Analytica, as we receive a consensus forecast for currency and inflation from 
another source.  Regarding IIF, it is an important source for us.  I will 
discuss the costs within the Research Group and advise you of how we will 
proceed.

Hi Maureen and Gwyn-

On the Oxford Analytica front, I'm glad you have found the service useful.  
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more 
users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per 
year.  We can charge $10K back to you.

On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here 
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of 
our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.

Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of 
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I 
need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.

Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on 
your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our 
colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and 
John Sherriff on that project from London.

Vince,

Mark Tawney called and said that he needs to make a salary adjustment for Joe 
Hrgovcic.   It appears that he has an outside offer.   I told him that we 
would support this, within reason, and that you would be the person to 
ultimately O.K. this request on the research side.    He is also interested 
in moving Joe out of research and formally onto the weather desk.   Again, I 
told him that it would have to be discussed with you on your return next week.

Molly,

Thanks for the update. Two points.

Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated
with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.

Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and 
Skilling),
I shall choose Neil.

Krishna,

Osman has informed me that he has been requested to provide research services 
to a larger number of clients in EES, leaving him less time to contribute to 
our work here at the EAM desk. While I am happy for him and believe that the 
company will benefit from his services, I am concerned that he may not be 
available at a crucial time in the development of the EAM option strategy.

The EAM desk is continuing to develop standard models for the bulk of our ECM 
projects. We have hired 4 people in the past month and all of them will be 
working by early September. Osman provides an important link for our new 
staff to several core areas of our business. First, his experience with 
modeling and energy analysis are invaluable. Second, as we move to treating 
our projects as options, and pricing them as such, Osman will be needed to 
assist us in creating auditable methods to assess savings volatility.

I am expecting two of the team members to start in San Francisco in the near 
future. My request is for Osman to be available to this team for one day a 
week for the next several months, preferably until Christmas.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Steve Kromer

 The Research Group is a unique and extraordinarily valuable organization for 
Enron.  The success of the group has led to widespread recognition of Enron's 
leadership in quantitative finance as it relates to the energy markets.  
Therefore, it is with great mixed emotions that I announce my resignation as 
I move on to the next phase of my career.

 I have enjoyed getting to work with each of you and wish you continued 
success for the future.

Highest regards,
Kevin Kindall

PS:   Comments, question, and anecdotes will be addressed in Thursday's 
meeting.
          Shirley will have my contact info.

Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have
our Holiday Party before the first of the year.   We wanted to use the Scout
House in West University like we did last year and it was not available.

Vince suggested that with the move and a lot of people taking vacation that
we wait until after the first of the year.  This way you can take advantage 
of 
"after Christmas sales"  for your gift!

Just remember whose name you have and we will schedule an "offsite"
after the first of the year.

Thanks!

Shirley

Rates are a LITTLE higher in August than they are in April (August is high 
season for summer), but I can do those rooms at $125 (your April rate was 
$105).

What kind of meeting space will you need?  If you can get me a tentative 
agenda, I will get the contract drawn up right away.

Thanks again!

Steve



>>> <Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com> 06/27/00 01:28PM >>>

Let's do it!  August 18 - 20 is our first choice!

Please send me all the information and then we will discuss the
particulars.

I will get Vince to sign it immediately.


Thanks Steve!

Hello again!

I PROMISE I am not running!  The deal that we worked out with the General
Manager (Tom Pratt) is that Enron has a $6000 credit with the Great Divide
Lodge that will expire on 8/1/00.  You can either use that credit for
individual rooms PRIOR to 8/1/00, or we have agreed that we can apply that
amount to a meeting prior to the Thanksgiving holiday in 2000 IF the
contract is SIGNED before 8/1/00.

At this point, August 18-20 is available, but the 25-28 is not.  If we can
get this signed prior to 7/31/00, your $6000 credit would be able to be
applied to this event.

Please let me know if this will work for you.  Thanks!

Steve

Hello Steve:

Please don't run!  I know after the last fiasco with an Enron offsite you
are
probably running for the hills!

I do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even
though we were unable to make the trip.

However, I understand there has been an arrangement made with Enron,
that if we book a time and come before Thanksgiving we can recoup the money
that we forfeited?  Please let me know if I am understanding this
correctly.

If so, we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite.

We are looking at the weekends of August 18, 19 and 20 or August  25,
26 and 27th.  There will be approximately 12 people.

Please let me know your understanding of the arrangement and the
availability of the dates mentioned.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Stinson,

Let's talk about it. It seems like an open personality clash developing 
for the first time in the history of the group.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the 
documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this 
almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on 
Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that 
together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not 
required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating 
his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

Molly:  just to be sure that everyone understands, Anshuman cannot work in 
the US on a B1 visa - he can only come here for business meetings and 
training.

We will have to get him the L1 visa in order for him to work in the US.

Molly,

I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project 
as a person
delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the L1 visa.

Subject: Re: Transition to Research Group - An Update  

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a 
project.     If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job 
description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.  

As for Sandeep, I have been told that he is a U.S. resident so there should 
be no problems with him.   Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be 
absolutely sure.

Thanks,
Molly

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a 
while
once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him 
longer,
given the priority of the project.

I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.

Thanks.

Thank you for the update, Vince.  I have been working with Margaret Daffin 
with regard to Anshuman's visa status.   We will have to get an L1 visa in 
place before he can come to the United States, even in a temporary 
capacity.    Do you  want to move forward with that effort at this time, or 
is the possibility of him coming to the U.S. so remote that it wouldn't be 
worth the time and money right now?

Molly,

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here. 

Vince

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,
Sandeep.

Pat:

Recently, I talked with you about ordering another filing unit.  It turns out that we need 2 more filing units.  Please order them the same size as the floor to ceiling cabinet we have.  Have the inside of the cabinets configured as follows:

1 Cabinet should have 5 shelves
1 Cabinet should have 6 shelves

When Interstore was here today reconfiguing 2 of our existing cabinets, they removed 8 shelves that they are going to use on these new units.

Please price these 2 new units and charge them to Co. # 0413, RC # 107043.  Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date.  Also, let me  know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita

Hello all:

Unfortunately, in the last two weeks we have had two of our Research "chairs"
disappear from their location.  We have reported this to Security, but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate. 

Facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones.   Since they are very expensive,  we have 
decided to "mark" our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name.  
Sam is going to order some "silver or white" markers and we will begin 
marking 
each chair.

It is a shame we have to do this, but know of no other alternative.  We will 
let you 
know when this will take place.

Thanks!

Shirley

The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

I don't know if you are already aware of this, but Maureen Raymond has been 
taken ill and I understand has received medical advice that she should not 
travel before the end of next week at the earliest.  
Tara is the appropriate HR representative in London; I will ask her to keep 
both you and Houston HR informed of the situation.

Many thanks,  Tani

Jason is currently working part-time for Mike Roberts and makes
very valuable contribution  to a number on-going projects.

We are very happy with his performance and see him as a valuable future
Enron employee.

Hi Tanya,

in my view it is very good if Stig and Kirstee are involved in your VaR 
meetings. Therefore, I think it is very useful for them to call Houston.

Could we get a little bit better equipment to allow them to hear everything 
well?

many thanks,

Subject: VaR meetings in Houston  

Hi Slava,

Kirstee and I find it useful to listen in on the VaR meetings in Houston on 
Wednesdays. 
However, it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical 
problem: we hear little or nothing at times. 
A possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install 
a "spider phone" in the VaR meeting room. 
What I mean is a phone similar to the one in the RAC morning meetings which 
have several remote speakers going out 
from the main phone (do you understand what I mean?). If this is done, we 
would  hear everyone around the table, 
not just those seated close to the phone. 

What is you opinion on 
A. us in  London calling in  to these meetings
B. getting some better equipment which would make it easier to follow the 
conversation ("spider phone" or  bigger speaker ..)

Please let me know what your thoughts are,

Best regards,

Stig

Tara:

 I am forwarding it to Vince for his approval.  It looks good although I have 
three questions:
1) I presume that it is clear that Enron pays housing up to 1500/month.  
Anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with.Utility bills are not 
included unless part of the rent, right?  This should be clarified; as you 
know, Houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket-book.
2) Economy class plane.  Can we even do that?  I thought Enron policy was for 
a B-class ticket for flights over 6 hours.
3) 500lbs of transport.  I don't know if this is a big ticket item, but I 
would give him less, 250 say, if it would save Enron considerable expense.

Regards,
Grant.

FYI,  I do not send out a written offer package until the verbal offer issues 
are resolved and a final offer is made.   So, I'd like to put the details 
below in writing and send out to him  for Tuesday delivery.     I'm playing

again in the morning.

Toni:

We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.


Regards,
Grant.

I just received a word from associate & analyst program that the official
starting dates are May 22, and June 2. They seem to be strict about this.
Hopefully I'll make it to May 22.

Toni,
I spoke with Ben this morning and he is asking me what he should do.   He
knows how good the opportunity is
and this is something he really wants to do.  However, his wife is having a
hard time making the commitment. Although he says she is not totally against
it, she is obviously not 100% sold.  Ben feels bad about keeping Vince,
Grant, and other potential team members at Enron waiting. He does not want
to lose the opportunity, yet he needs some help in convincing his wife. I am
open for suggestions.  Is this somebody you really want and if so what can
we do get him?

Thanks,
Mike

Good afternoon Sandeep:

I sent Krishna's expenses for his recent trip to our accounting dept. this 
morning and expensed them to the Research Group's Co and RC#.  
However, we need to be reimbursed for these expenses and I would like 
to know the best way to do this.  Our accounting dept. thought we should 
just send an invoice with the back up material to Dabhol Power Co. asking 
them to cut a check made payable to Enron Corp. and then it would be 
credited to our Co# and RC#.

Please let me know if this is acceptable, and if so, who the invoice should
be made out to and where I should send it.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Have a great day!

Goodmorning everyone ,

Last year we did quite a bit of Christmas baskets, during the time we were in 
the process of
another major move.
We are currently settled on all floors now , therefore our Christmas Basket 
List will be cut more than half.

Here are a list of the names that received baskets last year.

Matt Rodgers
Chris Hyde
Darren Prager

Charlie Notis
Harvey Freese
Jon Davis
Maryam Golnarghi



Delores Sustaita      Rodney Keys                  Iain 
Russell                   Trina Williams                             Todd 
Butler                       Pamela Ford                 Facilities

Robert Knight             Phillip Randle                Mary  
Martinez               Daniel Hornbuckle                    ( Ozarka ) 
Guy                   Move -Team
 


Greg Whalley
Richard Weeks
Mary Sue Rose

There are several names boldly printed that probably will not receive the 
baskets this year.
The Christmas season is approaching therefore we must start preparing
.
Please note that I will be out on vacation Dec 13th -18th , if possible I 
would like your list of names
before my vacation begins whereby all baskets can arrive at their 
destinations on time.

                                                     
                                                                              
     Thanks

Tara:

Thanks for the update. It seems Anjam is playing hard ball a little. My 
initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer, but on 
second thoughts, could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a 
12-month assignment when you have a moment?  Compensation, benefits, 
responsibilities, career path implications, etc.

Many thanks!

Regards,
Grant.

Vince,

Ravi never said a word to me and should have closely coordinated with me - 
otherwise he should have used his own name.  I have a problem with Ravi 
acting in that manner.  No one is questioning Shalesh' integrity but the 
Associate Analyst program called me and stated that Shalesh told them that I 
had requested the move.  If he did that he should not have used my name.  I 
am very sensitive to Analysts moving within a rotation.  It has happened to 
me numerous times and I do not appreciate the disruption it can cause.  If 
you need Shalesh for any reason then he will not be moving. 

Regards

Jim

Jim,

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS
came from Ravi Thuraisingham. My understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy
him. I shall be glad to keep him in the Research Group in his current role.

Have a good 4th of July.

Vince

I will be on the call. I may disconnect around 4:00 to attend the traders' 
daily meeting. 
A couple of issues:
1. Would it be possible to get Gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not 
have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in 
his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay.
2. It is getting noisier here. Gappy and I are wandering if we could get 
office space downstairs (that we share). We will maintain presence on 44, but 
we will be able to discuss when needed.

Vince,
Thanks for initiating this information flow. I think the confusion is coming 
from the question of if an F1 can apply for green card or not. To my 
knowledge and to the knowledge of international student services in my 
university, yes I can apply. Anyway, thanks again and I am sure we'll find a 
good answer for this question since here is Enron.

Sevil,

I believe you and Margret Daffin have spoken about the next steps for your 
Green Card.   You will need to start working on you HIB at the begining of 
October 2001.  

If there is any confusion on my part please let me know.

Norma Villarreal
X31545

Below is dicussion between Margret Daffin and Sevil in an e:mail January 26, 
2001:

"Sevil:  First of all we have to get you an HIB visa before we can work on 
getting you the Green Card.

After you get your OPT, contact me sometime in the summer and I will start 
working on your HIB visa which we will obtain in approx. October, 2001.  We 
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an F1 visa - you 
have to be on an HIB visa.  There is no rush - you will have six years on the 
HIB visa - plenty of time in which to get the Green Card."

This was in reference to her note to me, as follows:

"I think I'll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and 
opt. this makes almost two years. if we can start green card process now, do 
you think that I would get it before I need H1. In every case, can't we start 
green card before I get H1? Because I don't want to waste these two years 
given the fact that green card process is a long process."

Vince,
I just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the 
computer system
(it says that I have 0 C/over days).

It was November 3, 1999 when I asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation 
days to the next year .
I was thinking that if you (or HR) do not approve I could at least take these 
days in 1999. 

I know that your tried to help me and sent to  Brad McSherry the 
justification for me to carry over 10 days.
I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your 
response was optimistic
I did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.

Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake. 
I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/00 to 3/17/00).

What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response 
from HR in November or
December last year would be better than loosing vacation days.

I really appreciate your help,
Tanya.

Hi, Vince,
sorry to bother again with my question.

I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).

Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry 
over my 10  vacation days to the next year? 
If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations 
anyhow. I would really prefer not to take off
most of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.

Thank you for your help in resolving this question.

Tanya.

Steve,

Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal
rules going forward.

My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions
to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full 
picture.
Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no
control long-term.

I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules
for the Research sign-off.

Vince

Subject: Research sign off

Hi Sharad

I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to 
sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to 
do from time to time.

I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what 
it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and 
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot 
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I 
feel falls firmly within RAC territory.

This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other 
groups after all?  To "sign off" means to accept something, which our opinion 
in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical 
note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving 
the formal "sign off" to those best placed to assess these risks for our 
company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view 
on what is acceptable risk for the company.

Steve

Hello again!

I PROMISE I am not running!  The deal that we worked out with the General 
Manager (Tom Pratt) is that Enron has a $6000 credit with the Great Divide 
Lodge that will expire on 8/1/00.  You can either use that credit for 
individual rooms PRIOR to 8/1/00, or we have agreed that we can apply that 
amount to a meeting prior to the Thanksgiving holiday in 2000 IF the contract 
is SIGNED before 8/1/00.

At this point, August 18-20 is available, but the 25-28 is not.  If we can 
get this signed prior to 7/31/00, your $6000 credit would be able to be 
applied to this event.

Please let me know if this will work for you.  Thanks!

Steve

Hello Steve:

Please don't run!  I know after the last fiasco with an Enron offsite you are
probably running for the hills!

I do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even
though we were unable to make the trip.

However, I understand there has been an arrangement made with Enron,
that if we book a time and come before Thanksgiving we can recoup the money
that we forfeited?  Please let me know if I am understanding this correctly.

If so, we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite.

We are looking at the weekends of August 18, 19 and 20 or August  25,
26 and 27th.  There will be approximately 12 people.

Please let me know your understanding of the arrangement and the
availability of the dates mentioned.

Look forward to hearing from you.

I will be in the Houston office from Monday 10th July through Wednesday 19th 
July and stopping in NY on the return leg to meet staff at MG Metals NY on 
Thursday 20th July at the suggestion of Lloyd Fleming who is co-ordinationg 
the RAC activities for the integration of MG metals.  I will probably take a

I think you called his bluff. If he does not fax a copy of his paycheck stub,

Vince:  I left you a voicemail about Charles Shen a week or so ago, but 
wanted to follow up with you.  When I called him to extend our offer to him, 
he expressed surprise at the base salary offer of $110,000, and told me that 
he was currently earning base pay in the amount of $120,000.   I told him 
that the salary figure he had written himself on the application was 
$102,000, but he insisted that he had made an error and that it should have 
been $120,000.   I asked him what base salary he was looking for, and he said 
he would expect at least a 10% increase in his base.   I then told him that I 
was not authorized to make an offer above our initial one, and would contact 
you and get back to him.

I called him later that afternoon and asked him to fax me a copy of his last 
paycheck stub so that we could minimize the confusion about his base pay.  He 
said that he would be happy to do so,  but I never received the fax.  He left 
me a voicemail message during the evening that said he was on vacation and 
didn't have access to the pay stubs,  but would send me a copy when he 
returned.

I have not heard from him since, and wondered if he had contacted you.   If 
not, would you want to get together to discuss our next step?

I'll wait to hear from you,
Molly

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,
Sandeep.

Shirley:

Just a reminder that I had requested time-off on Tuesday, November 21, 2000, 
to attend a school function that I attend every year for a little friend of 
ours.   I know you will be on vacation but Leann will be here to help Vince 
or any of the rest of the department.  I would not normally take off when you 
are gone, but this is really important to Riley and I hate to disappoint 
him.  His school has Grandparents Day the Tuesday before Thanksgiving every 
year.   He does not have Grandparents that can attend so he has always asked 
my husband and I to come as his Special Friends. Usually, Al could just go 
alone but as you know he is in Hawaii taking care of his father and will not 
be here tomorrow.   I have worked enough extra hours to cover the time I will 
be off (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM or 1:30 PM).   I appreciate your consideration and 
thanks in advance if we can work this out.

Anita

Celeste,

We need to make sure that the interns in Vince's group are coordinated and 
incorporated with the rest of the summer associates.  They should be offered 
the same starting dates, I believe they are May 22, 2000 June 5, 2000.  I am 
not sure about the June date.  Would you check and let Vince know.  They 
should also be offered the same starting salary package as the others.  They 
will be included in training (a few days) and any other events we host.
Thanks

Vince:

Here are several items that you need to know about.

1.  Paul Johnson said that Monday night would be fine for the dinner with 
Spyros.

2.  Lucy Deathridge from Risk called and needed your presentation for the
     Boston conference by this evening in order to have copies made.  I told 
her
     you were in meetings and had been very busy, I did not know whether your
     presentation was ready or not.  We can have 500 copies made from the
     copy center and overnight them to her next week, but you won't be here on
     the 9th to do this.  Do you have any suggestions?

3.  I have been trying to schedule a meeting that Mike Roberts called about
     regarding e-online.  He said to schedule it for Friday at 11:30 am.  I 
called
     Mark Palmer and he knew nothing about the meeting, but said he would
     be here at 11:30 am.  However, I have been unable to reach Dan Diamond.
     Mike said that you might have his cell phone?

Thanks!

Dear Vince,

I just wanted to let you know that I'm working here for the summer.  I'm with 
CTG (Commercial Transactions) in the Industrial services group on the 30th 
floor.  I'm excited to be back at Enron and look forward to a great summer.  
I'm also happy to know that it is working out with the new members who have 
joined Research.  I hope you had a very nice Memorial Day weekend and an even 
better birthday.  Happy (belated?) birthday!

Warmest regards,
Van

Hi,

	Here is the title and abstract for Professor Kulatilaka's talk on May 17th at our 11:30 am Research Group luncheon/seminar.

Iris
 


Title: "Using the Mobile Internet to Make New Markets"



Abstract: 

  Professor Kulatilaka will talk about some new ideas that  he is working on which involve
using the micro billing/payments capability of a packet-switched wireless
network to create new markets.  The potential markets range from spot
markets for local spectrum to congestion-based pricing for highways.

Vince,

Sounds good!  It will take two or three days for me to strip out, reformat, 
and assemble the Kaminski columns(since we didn't do this last year, I'm 
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning), so I envision us being 
ready with the completed set the first part of next week.  I assume that you 
would like me to omit those people who have moved on?

Also,  on page three of the first volume, you had written an introduction.  I 
have updated  the content for volume two, but would you perhaps like to do a

Sam,

This is a partial list of people to whom I would like to send the volumes:

Volume 1 & 2

Winokur (Enron Board member, Shirley has his address)
Jeff Skilling
Ken Lay
Mark Frevert
Greg Whalley
Rick Buy
Jeff Shankman

Also, we can add additional volume for Kaminski's columns (just 10 copies),

Vince,

I have successfully integrated Martin's article into Volume II and am 
following Mike's instructions for reproduction.  I'm also having some 
additional Volume I's printed, too.  Would you mind disposing of the other 
set I gave you?  I wouldn't want things to get confused.  Also, I'm doing 20 
Volume I's and 60 Volume II's.  Please let me know how many you personally 
need and I will deliver them to your office.

Thank You,

Sam

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor 
or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal 
customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that 
Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but 
have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I 
hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I 
just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through 
Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your 
expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

Hello all:

Along with the inception of the New SAP time keeping, we also have new
expense account forms.

They will no longer use your social security number as the id on your 
expense accounts,  they want you to use your new employee # that was
sent to you by email to access HRonline.

In order for Anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports, we
will need your new employee #. 

Please send this number to me as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Shirley

I don't know if you are already aware of this, but Maureen Raymond has been taken ill and I understand has received medical advice that she should not travel before the end of next week at the earliest.  
Tara is the appropriate HR representative in London; I will ask her to keep both you and Houston HR informed of the situation.

Many thanks,  Tani

Dear all,

I have decided to attend Carnegie Mellon's Computational Finance program for 
the
2001-2002 academic year. The program starts on May 14th. 

Unfortunately due to the quick arrival of the starting date, my last day at 
Enron will
have to be Friday, April 13th 2001.

I have really enjoyed my last 10 months here at Enron which I've spent with 
the 
Research Group. 

Thank you.

-Hector

Let me read it Friday. We run our papers by our PR

I think you should submit it as an Enron employee with a note
that it was developed when you were at UT.

My supervising professors from UT and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that is based on work done for my PhD.  All of the research was done while I was a grad student.  I have a couple of questions regarding submission of this paper (to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems).

1.  Should I submit it with my affiliation as The University of Texas at Austin or as Enron (ENA, Corp, etc)?

2.  What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?

A draft of the paper for your review is attached.

Thanks,
Martin

Hi Norma,

 Sevil's primary project has been the Generation Bidding Analysis for the 
East Power Desk.  She worked closely with the Power Fundamentals group and 
the IT group in collecting and organizing the data, and then developing the 
analysis.  Sha has focused on the PJM area and plans to expand the analysis 
to other regions in the East.
 Sevil has also investigated the issue of Risk Premia in Power Prices 
compared to Marginal Cost.

Recently, I talked with you about ordering another filing unit.  It turns out 
that we need 2 more filing units.  Please order them the same size as the 
floor to ceiling cabinet we have.  Have the inside of the cabinets configured 
as follows:

1 Cabinet should have 5 shelves
1 Cabinet should have 6 shelves

When Interstore was here today reconfiguing 2 of our existing cabinets, they 
removed 8 shelves that they are going to use on these new units.

Please price these 2 new units and charge them to Co. # 0413, RC # 107043.  
Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date.  Also, let me  know 
if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita

Dear Vince,

As the holidays approach, I am excited by my coming break from classes
but also about the opportunity to see everyone at Enron again and to
work with you and them soon.  I am writing to let you know that I would
be very happy to work at Enron over my break and I would like to plan
out a schedule.

My semester officially ends Dec. 20th but I may be out of town the week
before Christmas.  I will be available the following three weeks, from
Monday, Dec. 27 to Friday, Jan. 14.  Please let me know if during those
three weeks, you would like me to work and for what dates you would need
the most help so that we can arrange a schedule that would be most
helpful to you and so that I can contact Andrea at ProStaff soon.
Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about a
possible work schedule for me.

Give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very happy
holiday season!  I look forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
Van Ngo

Dear Dr. Krishna,

As mentioned during the interviewing process, I plan to start working under
your supervision on earlier January. I'm now ready to start working with
your on Jan 8th, 2001. I have been in contact with the human resource
department to set up the working permit and relocation. I have received the
Optional Practical Training valid from Jan 8th, 2001 to Jan 7th, 2002. I
will go down to Houston to look for an apartment this weekend.
 By the way, I heard from Seksan, currently working under your supervision,
that you will be on vacation soon and will come back to work again late
January. Therefore, I would like to whether who  should I report with on my
starting date? Or do you have any recommendation for me to prepare for the
new work? Please, advise.

Best Regards,
Wichai Narongwanich

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.

I had a message on my phone this morning from WIlliam indicating that
he had changed his mind and will be taking another job. He also mentions that
the other organization will give him time to publish his  thesis and he 
assumes 
Enron would not do that.

I am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so.

Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Vince

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

Back in November of last year, you have indicated that 40% of the 17.5% (40% of 17.5 is 7%) that we are allocating to EGM should be billed to Gary Hickson's group.  Gary is asking for further broken down of this 40% to his world.  Can you check with Vince to see what portion of the 7% should be charged to Equity Trading, Rate & Currency Trading, Agricultural Trading & Origination and Convertible trading?  And can I get this information back by the end of this week because we are going to start closing on Friday.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere Overdyke),

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?

Norma,

I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed
merit and equity increases.

I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
The equity increases address two issues: retention and
and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).

Please, let me know if there are any questions.
I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address
so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.

Neil,

I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep
every few days).

Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month
to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised
me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration
of  his stay.

Sorry for the confusion.

Molly,

It  seems that we got only Bill Bradford so far.

Given that almost everybody will be out that week,
we probably should move the interview to the
beginning of January, even if it means higher
costs.

Sir,

I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2,200K.  This is net of 
Corp Charges and Intercompany billings.  In order to get to this number, we 
have to reduce your budget by 83K.  Do you have any suggestions in which 
category(ies) we need to reduce?

 Budget  10,521,000
 I/C billings   8,238,000
 Subtotal   2,283,000
 Per Delainey   2,200,000
 Need to dec by      83,000

Here are my suggestions based on Oct expenses:

 Category   Oct expense  Budget  Decrease Yearly amount

 Periodical/subscription  5,200   10,000  3,000  36,000
 Tuition and Reimbursement 11,000   21,000  4,000  48,000

This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by Delainey.  Please let me 
know your decision by November 21.  If you have any questions, call me at 
5-7094.  Thanx.

We would like to bring this student as a summer intern (the last one,
we are running out of space).

I shall send you another message regarding his proposed dates.

Thanks. I hope you have a very Happy Easter.

Margaret,

Thanks for reminding me this issue. I think I'll be fine until I start full time here in the research group. As you know right now I am using curricular practical training as work permission. And until I graduate I am allowed do as many as part time CPT I want to do. Because of tax purposes I think I'll use this right given to me. In this case, what I need to do is that after I and Vince make sure about my full time start date (this may happen in the beginning of 2002), I'll let you know and send you the necessary document you require to initiate my H1B visa application process. Thanks again.

Sevil,

Subject: Re: Sorry.  

Chonawee,

This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage
the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else) 
on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation
of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s
convictions.

Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only
way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the
company) is by having open communication.  In Enron,
facts are friendly.

By the way, it was an excellent presentation.

Hi Vince, I am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions. 
Vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same 
expected revenue to the auctioneer. (Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, 
and second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the 
valuation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, 
everyone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of 
the second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation 
bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the 
winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder.
Thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions.

Vince,

A quick update on job candidates:

1)  Nelson Neale:   relayed your request to Norman, and told Nelson that an 
offer is in progress.  Did not mention specific numbers to him.

2) Charles Shen:  left a message for him that we would get back to him next 
week with details of an offer.

3)  Interviewed by phone Tom Barkley at Thunderbird (brought to our attention 
by Enron recruiters there).   He looks very interesting so I am trying to 
schedule a visit to Enron for him.   He will finish T-bird in December (MBA) 
and has a bachelors with honours in Mathematics.


Have a great weekend.

Stinson

I would like to attend the following conference:  "Monetary Policy in the New 
Economy" on October 19th in Washington DC. This is the topic of an Annual 
Conference on Monetary Policy.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is the keynote 
speaker.   Also, former Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and many  prominent 
monetary economists will be attending and participating in the debate on U.S. 
monetary policy.   The cost of the conference is $375.  While in Washington, 
I could also arrange meetings with the IIF economist on our largest 
investment exposures.  In addition, I could interview Mark Giancola and 
possibly some other candidates from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced 
International Studies for our group.

Hi guys!

As most of you know by now today is my last day at Enron North America. It 
has been really great few months and Maureen has most graciously put up with 
my school and exam schedule. As today is also my graduation from the 
University of Houston, I don't have any formal reasons to remain in Houston 
and will be heading to the misty Albion to work for Enron Europe as soon as 
my work permit for the UK is ready. The latter is still a mystery but is 
anticipated some time in early February. Right now I am planning to come back 
to Houston middle of January to wait for the work permit and sell my car, 
some furniture, etc. (stay tuned for great deals :-) So, I will be back to 
see you guys. If you miss me too much try to find consolation in Miss Yana 
Kristal, a U of H student of Slavic origin, who will be taking over my 
responsibilities starting early January. I know I will miss you and am 
planning to sneak in the video conferencing room during the Thursday 
meetings. I know it won't be the same, but it's better than nothing. Or you 
can start planning that trip to London...

Below are the numbers where if you can't reach me there will be information 
where I might be.

Phone numbers:
Houston: 713-213-7733 - cell & voicemail
Sofia: (011) +359 2 74 73 06 - home (+8 hours from Houston)

E-mail: marty@myself.com

Travel schedule:
Leave Houston and go to Sofia December 21;
Come back to Houston January 15 (depending on how the work permit is coming ).

Have very, very Happy Holidays and a great Millenium!

Martina

Tani Nath who heads up the Structuring and Research teams rang this morning 
to get more information on Tony.

Can you tell me who he reports to in Houston and whether that person will 
continue to manage him remotely?

What cost centre he should be charged to ? whose headcount he appears on, and 
for what group he will be providing services for, Tani was unsure on all of 
the above and wants clarification.

Also can you confirm his start date in London

Hi

Tony is a UK employee who starts next Monday 12th March 2001, we have done a 
quick start in Nest today for him.

Tony will be working his first month in the Houston office, however we still 
need to set up a log on and notes account here. 

Can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to Kevin as he 
will be meeting with Tony on Monday morning in the Houston office.

Tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in 
approximately a month so no actual PC is necessary until then. 

One question - with a UK log on and notes account, will Tony be able to 
access these from Houston? if it's complicated can you please let Kevin know 
how to do this. 

any problems let me know

thanks

Desleigh

Vince,
Thanks for your response.  Apparently, we were under the incorrect impression 
that your group would be taking Li (based on Jeff's note below).  We 
apologize for not contacting you last Friday to confirm prior to "placing" Li 
in your group.  I have faxed Li's resume to you and hope that you will have 
time to review it today.  Please call me back as soon as you can to discuss 
Li's opportunities in your group.  

If Vince is not interested in Li for his group, we will consider Li placed in 
ENA - Gas Trading (original placement) in John Lavorato's organization.  Once 
I hear from Vince one way or the other, the program will consider Li's 
placement final in either Research or ENA - Gas Trading.  Hopefully this will 
be resolved by Tuesday morning so that we may communicate to Li her rotation 
information.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank You!

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed

I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Kevin-

I need to apologize to you for speaking out-of-turn yesterday about 
work-in-progress. Any model our group has of the natural gas system remains 
completely untested and unvalidated. I have not been asked by any one of my 
superiors, Vasant or Wince, to give advice to anyone at Enron concerning 
natural gas; I am not an expert in trading natural gas. My work exists within 
a large and professional group, and, to the point, Vince alone will decide 
when, and if, any gas model is suitable for dissemination within Enron.

Sincerely,

Clayton Vernon
Manager, Research

Vince: 
 Looks like an excellent value overall if they cover the same topics in these 
classes as in the Enron internal classes. The website says that registering 
for one of the classes automatically registers you to the expo. I would like 
to recommend them to my team. Did someone from our group already register for 
this? 

Thanks
Krishna.

Shirley,

Please, forward this info to John Sherriff in London on my behalf. Make sure
the entire body of the message is included.

Vince
**********************************************************

John,

I am sending you a proposed draft of the announcement about Steve Leppard.
Sorry for the delay.

When I was leaving London, the question of reporting lines was still
unresolved. It wasn't  decided if Steve would report to Richard Lewis
directly or  to structuring. Steve's preference was reporting to Richard
Lewis. This issue was to be resolved between you and Richard (based on the
last conversation I had with Richard). The 2nd reporting line is to me.
The draft is below.

Vince

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The Enron Europe Research group has experienced rapid growth over the last
year as it has become clear that there are tremendous opportunities to
utilize their unique quantitative skills in supporting both new and ongoing
business efforts in the London offices.  Because of this, we are appointing
a group leader with the view to leveraging the group better across the many
business areas in Enron Europe which are benefiting from research support.

Effective   immediately,   Steven  Leppard  will  take  responsibility  for
spearheading  research  efforts  in  London  and  managing the London based
research  team.   Steve  joined  Enron  in early 1999 and has distinguished
himself   through   his   many  contributions  including  analysis  of  the
"Supergoal"  scheduling  system  and development of a diagrammatic approach
for  real  options  analysis.  He holds a PhD. in Mathematical Physics from
Kings  College  London  and  an honours degree in Mathematics from Imperial
College.   Steve is also a black-belt level instructor in Kungfu.

Please join us in congratulating Steve on his new responsibilities.

 I wanted to submit my notice of rotation to the "Fundamental Analysis" group 
and thank the FX and Country Risk group for giving me an opportunity to work 
in such exiting learning environment. I really enjoyed being part of the 
Research group and hope to keep all of the relationships I have developed 
throughout my rotation.   I am looking forward to my new position as an 
opportunity to learn more about the company and to try my abilities in a new 
environment. "Fundamental Analysis" group is a new and developing group, 
which will give me an opportunity to develop and grow as an employee.
 I understand that it is my responsibility to train the individual who will 
be taking my current position.  In an effort to make a smooth transition to 
my new rotation I will train the new individual and starting December 18th 
will devote my free time to pursue my new job responsibilities.  In agreement 
with Maureen official start date of new rotation is January 2nd  2001.

Sincerely,
Yana Kristal

Hello all:

I have some "good" news and I have some "bad" news.  The "good" news
is that we are growing!  The "bad" news is that we are running out of space.

Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices
on the 19th floor for "summer" interns.

I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be
ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is
over.

I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing
spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left
without any extra spaces.

Thanks!

Shirley

Subject: Rollover of my vacation days to 2001

Vince:
 I would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of 
this year to 2001. I could not use us all of my available vacation this year 
because of the following reasons:

1. As you know, I have been supporting three business units (EES, EPG & Enron 
India) this year. All these units had difficult and relatively long projects 
that required experience in energy markets, derivatives pricing and business 
knowledge that I had gained over the last few years at Enron.

2. There has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me. I 
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year. 
Of the current six members, five joined us only this year and most of them 
didn't have any prior work experience, thus requiring a lot of my time in 
recruiting, training and mentoring.

3. Given that I had to visit our Bombay office in January, 2000 for a 
business trip (10 days) and will need to go there again in January, 2001, I 
could not take leave from my work for the other two units (EES & EPG) for an 
extended period of time.

So, in summary, this year has been a long and challenging one, and as a 
result, I could not take vacation for more than a few days. I request you to 
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year. 

Currently I have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these, I expect to 
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year.

Thank you,
Krishna.

Sheila,

A reminder about promoting Martin Lin from associate to manager.   Do we have 
any leeway on his salary adjustment?   He is currently at 81K, and I 
understand that his new salary can be made retroactive to Aug. 1, 2000.

thanks,

Stinson,

Makes perfect sense. Per head cost is much lower.
We shall have enough candidates.

Vince,

Since a number of individuals in the group are interested in Java training,   
I checked to see what an internal course would cost.   We can have an 
internal class for up to 15 people for a fee of $15k.    Clayton Vernon also 
indicated that we might be able to share some of the cost with his group.   
It seems that anyone dealing with VAR or EOL is likely to need some Java 
skills, so I think it would be a good investment.

Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is 
moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I 
met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up 
a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so 
that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during 
the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me 
this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so 
that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look 
forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff 
meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

If it is all right I would like to take a couple hours vacation in the 
morning.  My
grandson starts "middle school" (6th grade) and he wants me to take him.

I should be in by 10:00 am.

Thanks!

Shirley

Thanks for the e-mail.  Please let me know if Clayton does not honor his 
commitment to complete his current project.  I am giving Clayton an 
opportunity (next 6 months) to prove he can add value to our operation 
creating state of the art decision support tools.  If he fails, I will take 
the necessary steps.

Thank you.
