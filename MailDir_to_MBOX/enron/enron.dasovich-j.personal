Hello all:

At Jeff's request, I called 1-800-CRUISES to get some info. Here is what I
found in summary:

Royal Caribbean, "Vision of the Seas"--glassed in area for viewing
July 17 departure, 7 day cruise                            June 18, 7 day
cruise

$1499/per person, inside room                              $1300/person,
inside room
$1699/per person, ocean view                               $1599/person,
ocean room

Leave out of Vancouver, visit Hubbard Glacier, Skagway, Haines, Misty fjords,
Inside passage, Ketchikan, Juneau.  New ship( built in 1997) 2200 passengers,
 large glassed in area to view scenery/wildlife.

For an extra approximately $900/person, you can add a 3 day land package
which is basically a visit to McKinley and Denali, and probably Fairbanks.
Representative said as long as you are all the way up there, you should go
see the wildlife.

Carnival Cruises goes too but this cruise sounded more suited to mom and dad.
According to the rep, more elegant, good food, etc.

I have a courtesy reservation for the July cruise (figuring it might be
warmer, though she said that June and July are warmest) I got the ocean view
room.

I don't know 1-800 CRUISES   from Adam.  I will try and call my travel agent
tomorrow just to see what she says about Royal Caribbean.

If we do the July cruise and land package, it is $4998 (air fare, cruise,
port costs) for mom and dad which comes to $1300 for each one of us.

I leave Saturday for a week so I'd appreciate some feedback before I go if
possible (not necessarily a commitment, just feedback).  I think they have
this hold for a few days though I don't necessarily think we have to decide
immediately.  If we want to do this, there is a $300/person deposit (didn't
ask if it is refundable or not), with the balance due 75 days before
departure.

What do you think?

Debbie

I'm taking a break from my telecom research on "the last mile."  Whoda
thunk?  My prof repeatedly refers to the RBOCs as dinosaurs and lunkheads.
Gotta love that required Info Systems class.

Life in Texas is pretty swell, despite the midterm anxiety.  The weather
couldn't be more perfect and Friday afternoons are ideal for mountain
biking.  I've decided if you're not falling down, you're not riding hard
enough.  There's great singletrack just down the hill from our place.

Sometimes it feels like a glorified placement agency around here and the
core classes could more aptly be named chore classes, but for the most part
we're having fun.  I have tons (well, 400 actually) of interesting and smart
classmates and I even like the ones fixated on grades (mostly).

I'm writing for the Texas Business Weekly, the student paper for the
b-school.  I did the cover for the next issue and even got to interview the
Dean.  It's fun and challenging -- a nice change from all the number
crunching.

Oh, and I'm playing intramural football.  I got to play QB for one series in
the last game.  We were marching down that field, then ZOWIE, interception!
Not to worry, our team is so bad we lose by the mercy rule.  I didn't know
there was a mercy rule in football.

Ted's doing great.  He started out as a product analyst for voice and a
local telecom firm.  That wasn't so exciting.  But a couple months ago he
got an offer within the same firm to become a Strategic Alliances Manager so
now he fancies himself a deal-maker.  He's much happier and more engaged by
his work, which is a joy for me to see.  And he's building a circle of
friends there.  We're going to a wine-tasting tonight that's being hosted by
one of his co-workers.  Have any recommendations for "Tuscan" wines?

He's also being a trooper about taking care of me and the domestic duties
during this school thing.  Danger:  I could really get used to that.  Nice
to know we still like each other -- we celebrated our 5th anniversary last
month.

How are things with you?  Still bringing enlightenment to the world?

Congratulations on the new car, Kari!

This is Jeff, of course, once again having to decline the Tuesday night dinner
invite. However, this month I am declining from a seat on United's flight 955
from London to San Fran. Isn't that special ;)?  Believe it or not, this is
relevant to you (all of you, not just Kari). That is because, as I was romping
around England trying to escape my everyday working life, I spent three days 
at
Porlock Vale on the West coast of the green isle riding some really nice 
horses.

I am especially sorry that I can not join the dinner to share my experience.

Now, I do recall some talk of taking a group holiday in England or Ireland in
2000. This is an unabashed attempt to persuade those interested in signing on 
to
a stay at the Porlock house. Some of you may have already heard this stuff 
from
Laura who was there a few years ago. The property is now owned by a bright and
professional couple (Helen & Kim) who were frequent guests until they succumb 
to
the dreamy idea that they could escape their hectic London existence for one 
of
country charm. From the return guests who were staying with me, the place 
hasn't
changed much since the change in ownership. No one seemed to miss the former
owners too terribly.

The house and grounds were immaculate. The original house and stables were 
built
in the 1930's for the hunt. It sits within the Exmoor National Forest, 
directly
on the coast. My room's view was of the paddocks that bordered the beach. 
Across
the Bristol channel, I could see South Wales - The local saying goes that, 'If
you can see South Wales, it is going to rain. If you can't see South Wales, it
is already raining'. I had my share of both - I could also see the village of
Porlock through the trees. The house is everything you might think of as the
stereotypical country English manner. Able to accommodate around 23 people, it
is full of dark wood, overstuffed chairs, a fireplace, antique furniture and
artwork. The common areas include three large sitting rooms, a dining room 
and a
well-stocked bar. The guest rooms each have their own private bath (The 
plumbing
works! Something that can not be taken for granted in England), Feather 
duvets,
extra pillows, lots of lace and a coffee/tea service. Phones and TV's are also
included for those who just can't stand it.

The property is about 20 acres. all of it well manicured. Flowering gardens
surround the house. In addition to the original stable, there are a number of
separate stalls, enough to house over 30 horses. Most of the land is in grass
paddocks that also contain the cross country fences/obstacles Any number of
courses could be set up with a tremendous variety of challenges and levels of
difficulty - The property has been the training facility for several Olympic
eventing teams. Also on the property are two indoor riding facilities, 
allowing
for all weather riding. One is larger than a competition dressage arena where
jumping classes are taught. The other is about one half the size of a dressage
arena and used for flat lessons. The footing seemed good in both.

As it sits with in the Exmoor National Forest, hacking in the woods is 
literally
across the road from the house's entrance. Actually, we rode through the local
village on several occasions to access the trails. It's not like there is a 
lot
of traffic to negotiate. The Exmoor is made up of rolling land that borders 
the
coast. We followed small roads and trails up heavily wooded ravines to the
windswept tops of the moors. When the weather allowed, we had fantastic views 
of
the ocean and the valleys with pastoral scenes of green farms dotted by sheep
herds. The hacks always included a wild gallop through the heather. Aside from
the grazing sheep, the moors are inhabited by wild ponies and red deer, both 
of
which I saw.

Back at the house, the guests are never lacking of energy due to poor 
nutrition
(they might be hung-over, but never hungry). You will find better food and 
wine
in San Francisco's restaurant scene, but the quality and variety of the 
Porlock
house is really quite good. Breakfast consisted of fruits and cereal followed 
by
a hot, traditional English fare. Dinner was a a white-linen, 4 course affair
featuring fresh salads, local game and fish and deserts that were, frankly,
obscene. They provide a good selection of wines as well. Casual dress is
appropriate, however, they do ask that you not wear your breeches to the 
table.
And, that's about as stuffy as it gets. For all the tradition in the house, 
the
owners and staff go out of their way to keep the mood lighthearted and jovial.
Unless you've fallen in with the wrong crowd, you are going to have a great
time.

Have I forgotten to mention the horses and instructors? Oh my. I am sorry to
have kept you in suspense ...

The horses were great! For us GGPS folks, they are by far better than anything
we've ridden lately. For you, "Oh, but of course I have my own horse in Marin"
crowd, I don't think you will be disappointed. They are well-schooled,
well-cared-for and happy to work. They are Irish and English bred 
thoroughbreds
and warmbloods. I rode a couple of sensitive thoroughbred mares in flat 
lessons,
and an equine version of a Sherman tank on the trails. I didn't see it myself,
but apparently this guy was one heck of a jumper. With feet the size of dinner
plates, he must land with quite an earth-shaking thud. I mean, this guy was 
BIG!
My only concern about the horses was that (at least the three I rode) they all
seemed heavy in the hands. All the horses I saw wore running martingales. It
seems to be something common in the training there. Ok, ok, so I'm getting
picky.

The instructors, were also great. All the guests seemed happy with their
lessons. Of the two instructors I had, both were better than what we normally
see at GGPS (Will the Marin crowd please loose the smirks), and one was on par
with Lisa McCluskey. I was very pleased. It seems that the instructors talk
amongst themselves about the students. Several of us had the experience of
changing instructors who made comments about our previous lessons. All hacks 
are
led by someone from the stable (for the singers in the group, there is one 
girl
who has some ditty going most of the ride).

So my typical day was up at 7:00 to watch the sun rise (In December, it rises
all day and never quite gets anywhere) and take a walk. At 8:30, breakfast was
served. At 9:30, the first hack went out and the first lessons started. Lunch
could be had at the house or a short drive took us to a couple of small 
villages
where we would find the local pub. One has to remember that Guinness, while 
for
strength, is not for enhancing one's riding in the afternoon. The last lessons
begin at 3:30. Much to my pleasure, that left about 3 hours before dinner.
Plenty of time for a nap, maybe some reading, a hot bath and tea, and then
downstairs to sit by the fire and have cocktails with the other guests. Dinner
was served at 7:30, followed by coffee and after-dinner drinks, again, by the
fire. All-in-all, quite lovely. I am beginning to better understand the why 
the
English so cherish tradition. If you were wealthy, it was a damn fine 
tradition.

There is plenty for non-riders as well. The Exmoor National Forest is just as
accessible to hikers as it is to riders. At least two small villages are 
within
20 minutes walk. With a car, a lot of good touring could be done down the 
coast
towards lands end. If one is low on motivation, hanging around the house would
actually make for a fine day or two.

And so, I've already told them that I will be bringing a small contingent of
ex-colonists next summer. Helen suggested early June, as it is before the 
heavy
tourist season, but late enough that the cross-country courses should be dry 
for
good footing. They do not like to accept groups of more than 8 people, you 
will
need to bring a UK standard certified helmet for all but the flat work, and 
they
have a strict weight limit of 189 pounds (they do turn down guests in excess)
for riders.

Discuss amongst yourselves. I'm sure we could have a good time somewhere else,
but why risk it.

Jeff.

All his complaining turned out to be real after all.  Peter left Landels in
a group of six environmental partners (including Landels' biggest rainmaker)
on Friday and is now a partner at Farella, Braun and Martell.  It is a
medium-size, SF-based firm of about 100 lawyers that did not have an
environmental dept before.  There was a lot of drama at Landels over the
last month as this was taking place, but Peter is very happy to be leaving
and thinks the new firm is going to work out great.  I don't know, but they
do have a wine country office and represent Mondavi and Frog's Leap and a
few others so I might get a weekend trip or at least some wine out of the
deal.  You can read all about it in the SF Legal Recorder and Daily Journal
legal newspapers from last week.  Peter's group is covered in Friday's
editions.  Peter's new office number is 954-4940 and is at pmodlin@fbm.com.

I'm still plugging away for your so-called competition.  How's life?  How's
school?

Jeff,
I will send you a fax tomorrow that outlines the financial planning process.  
I believe you will find that it a worthwhile exercise.  I would also like to 
better understand the phantom stock program.  I will ask a few questions 
around here and see what I can find out for you.

     Hi all,

     Have been copied on the cruise email exchanges and agree with the July
     time frame reminding all of Dad's usual July 4th Keewatin excursion,
     important or not. Will attempt on my end to garnish feedback from
     those I know who have made the same cruise. My cruise is going
     remarkably well amidst Navy wargames etc.

     See you all at Mom's retirement party!

     Steve

My travel agent is sending me some brochures.  1-800-cruises called back with
more info too.  I will look at it all when I get back and we can discuss.
What about dinner out? Do we still want to do that? If so, dates that work
for you all?

Have a great time at Mom's party next week.  Add my best wishes for any and
all toasts.

Debbie

Jeff,

Thanks for the great weekend.  I had a great time with you guys up at
the dome.

I just talked to my friend Curtis Press and he said to have you give him
a call about Annie and Vegas.  From what I know he is a very good vet.
He will also definitely let you know if the surgery makes sense (for
Annie) and who he thinks should do the surgery, etc.

He works most days at the Mission Valley Pet hospital in San Francisco.
The phone number there is 552-1969.  He and his wife also own a pet
hospital in Larkspur.

Sean

Hello everyone,

After much research and some delay, I have the info that I think will work
well for Mom and Dad.  I tried to combine a NICE cruise (good food,
accommodation, itinerary) with cost.

Here's what I have come up with:

Princess Cruises
Dawn Princess (ship), July 17 departure, 7 night cruise
Vancouver-Inside passage-Ketchikan-Juneau-Skagway-Glacier Bay-College Fjord
crossing-Seward(Anchorage)
Outside room with balcony
$2555.45/per person

I also think that they should spend a day in Vancouver before the cruise.
That adds $258/night (I think they should stay 2 nights--they fly up
Saturday, have Saturday night and Sunday, board the ship on Monday).  The
somewhat high price is because they stay at either the Four Seasons or Sutton
Place.

The total is $6026 or $1506 for each of us (if I did the math right--check
it).  This price includes airfare, port charges, all food etc on board. It
doesn't include alcohol or sodas on board, any excursions taken in port
(sightseeing tours), tips for cabin steward, waiter and busboy (about $200
for the trip). So we could also throw in a few hundred dollars of mad money.

This price ($2555.45 per person with the hotel in Vancouver) is really
great--they are doing some kind of special.  Holland America is much more and
a comparable cruise with no balcony is $2440).

I have a reservation for them which is good until Monday.  There is a $500
deposit required with the balance due 60 days before departure.

Let me know what you think--comments, etc.

Debbie

Hi Jeff,

It will be great to see you guys again.? I have a trek July 10-16 with 28 
riders....so that week is definitely out!? We are really becoming extremely 
busy, so I'm glad you are planning early, as some weekends we totally book 
up.? (I presume we're talking about a weekend.....)? So, is July 22, 23 or 
July 29, 30 better for you?? How many will be coming, and for how many days?? 
I have bought 9 new horses this past month....want to try some of them out, 
or stick with the tried and true???? Russia is now a gelding, but I bought 
two Arabian stallions....we'll see which (if any) of them remain so....

We no longer routinely provide lunches on all day rides, by the way, but can 
do so for an additional $15 per lunch, with prior warning.?? 

Jeff Green's telephone number is 707-964-7346.? He's a busy guy, also.? Isn't 
country living supposed to be relaxing?

Re. the NY Times article (and all the reprints in newspapers all over the 
country).....be careful what you wish for!

But getting a message from you reminds me of what I love most about this 
business.....the opportunity to meet and schmooze with folks like you and 
yours!

Ciao,

Lari

Hi Madeleine,

Have a great time in Chili.....  Just a thought, .....my daughter, Kyala,
has a friend who's family runs a river fishing and horseback riding
vacation place in Argentina....email Ky a <amiga@northcoast.com> to ask how
to contact them, if you are interested.

I'd love for you folks to come up again in January, although I will only be
here for a few days out of the month.  However, Helene could "lead" your
ride, and I'll bet Harvey would like to  join you.  I'll be on the
millenium trek from Jan 13th on.   I'm here from FEb 10th to 22nd, then
gone for another couple weeks.  I'm planning for "special" rides once a
month for the next year....would love to have you and yours be here for as
many of them as possible!

Here's the info for them...

Rates: $195 per day/arrange your own lodging & meals/ bring your own lunch/
English or Western horses available/ join other compatable RRR riders.
Sign up for as many/few days each weekend as you like.  Carpool information
from San Francisco Bay area available.

Also available: 3 ($75.00) or 4 hour ($100) rides.  If you would prefer to
have a "private" excursion, just whomever is in your group with a guide,
surcharge of  $25 (3 hours), $35 (4 hours, or $45 (all day) applies.

I've often mentioned Porlock Vale to the group as a great place to visit.
Jeff Walker recently asked me about my impressions.  Curious, I decided to
see if Porlock Vale has a web site up and running and it does.  Just looking
at it makes me long to go back.  I'd say the pictures of the facilities and
the comments are fairly accurate of what one can expect to find there.
Thought you all might be interested in a look see.

Sorry I missed you on Saturday.  Hope to see you soon.

no slams intended on my part - but you have to admit, there is a world of
difference between GGPS and owning or leasing one's own horse, in Marin, or
elsewhere.   Happy Holidays to All!   --Laura

wow, it sounds delightful even to this jaded Marin rider (hey, what's with

i'd tell you all about my bit of time on oahu this past week, but after this

sooner.

Jeff,

Wow!  I thought you were going to Porlock next year.

Your summary of Porlock is just as I remember - Helen and Kim were in place
when I visited. The manor house sounds just the same.  The food, the riding,
the treks, the pubs (...the hangovers).  I even remember the horse with the
dinner plate size feet.  I didn't ride him myself, but I watched him go over
a cross country course.  In fact, I recall using the phrase "dinner plates"
to describe the size of his shoes in my journal.   I've never seen a horse
with feet that big jump anything, let alone jump that well.   It was
definitely a sight to see.    And the gallops through the heather --
awesome.  I've never experienced anything like it before or since.

Once again,  I highly recommend a visit to Porlock.  I think even the Marin
horse crowd will enjoy it.

Cheers!

--Laura

Subject: Re: dinner next tuesday




Congratulations on the new car, Kari!

This is Jeff, of course, once again having to decline the Tuesday night
dinner
invite. However, this month I am declining from a seat on United's flight
955
from London to San Fran. Isn't that special ;)?  Believe it or not, this is
relevant to you (all of you, not just Kari). That is because, as I was
romping
around England trying to escape my everyday working life, I spent three days
at
Porlock Vale on the West coast of the green isle riding some really nice
horses.

I am especially sorry that I can not join the dinner to share my experience.

Now, I do recall some talk of taking a group holiday in England or Ireland
in
2000. This is an unabashed attempt to persuade those interested in signing
on to
a stay at the Porlock house. Some of you may have already heard this stuff
from
Laura who was there a few years ago. The property is now owned by a bright
and
professional couple (Helen & Kim) who were frequent guests until they
succumb to
the dreamy idea that they could escape their hectic London existence for one
of
country charm. From the return guests who were staying with me, the place
hasn't
changed much since the change in ownership. No one seemed to miss the former
owners too terribly.

The house and grounds were immaculate. The original house and stables were
built
in the 1930's for the hunt. It sits within the Exmoor National Forest,
directly
on the coast. My room's view was of the paddocks that bordered the beach.
Across
the Bristol channel, I could see South Wales - The local saying goes that,
'If
you can see South Wales, it is going to rain. If you can't see South Wales,
it
is already raining'. I had my share of both - I could also see the village
of
Porlock through the trees. The house is everything you might think of as the
stereotypical country English manner. Able to accommodate around 23 people,
it
is full of dark wood, overstuffed chairs, a fireplace, antique furniture and
artwork. The common areas include three large sitting rooms, a dining room
and a
well-stocked bar. The guest rooms each have their own private bath (The
plumbing
works! Something that can not be taken for granted in England), Feather
duvets,
extra pillows, lots of lace and a coffee/tea service. Phones and TV's are
also
included for those who just can't stand it.

The property is about 20 acres. all of it well manicured. Flowering gardens
surround the house. In addition to the original stable, there are a number
of
separate stalls, enough to house over 30 horses. Most of the land is in
grass
paddocks that also contain the cross country fences/obstacles Any number of
courses could be set up with a tremendous variety of challenges and levels
of
difficulty - The property has been the training facility for several Olympic
eventing teams. Also on the property are two indoor riding facilities,
allowing
for all weather riding. One is larger than a competition dressage arena
where
jumping classes are taught. The other is about one half the size of a
dressage
arena and used for flat lessons. The footing seemed good in both.

As it sits with in the Exmoor National Forest, hacking in the woods is
literally
across the road from the house's entrance. Actually, we rode through the
local
village on several occasions to access the trails. It's not like there is a
lot
of traffic to negotiate. The Exmoor is made up of rolling land that borders
the
coast. We followed small roads and trails up heavily wooded ravines to the
windswept tops of the moors. When the weather allowed, we had fantastic
views of
the ocean and the valleys with pastoral scenes of green farms dotted by
sheep
herds. The hacks always included a wild gallop through the heather. Aside
from
the grazing sheep, the moors are inhabited by wild ponies and red deer, both
of
which I saw.

Back at the house, the guests are never lacking of energy due to poor
nutrition
(they might be hung-over, but never hungry). You will find better food and
wine
in San Francisco's restaurant scene, but the quality and variety of the
Porlock
house is really quite good. Breakfast consisted of fruits and cereal
followed by
a hot, traditional English fare. Dinner was a a white-linen, 4 course affair
featuring fresh salads, local game and fish and deserts that were, frankly,
obscene. They provide a good selection of wines as well. Casual dress is
appropriate, however, they do ask that you not wear your breeches to the
table.
And, that's about as stuffy as it gets. For all the tradition in the house,
the
owners and staff go out of their way to keep the mood lighthearted and
jovial.
Unless you've fallen in with the wrong crowd, you are going to have a great
time.

Have I forgotten to mention the horses and instructors? Oh my. I am sorry to
have kept you in suspense ...

The horses were great! For us GGPS folks, they are by far better than
anything
we've ridden lately. For you, "Oh, but of course I have my own horse in
Marin"
crowd, I don't think you will be disappointed. They are well-schooled,
well-cared-for and happy to work. They are Irish and English bred
thoroughbreds
and warmbloods. I rode a couple of sensitive thoroughbred mares in flat
lessons,
and an equine version of a Sherman tank on the trails. I didn't see it
myself,
but apparently this guy was one heck of a jumper. With feet the size of
dinner
plates, he must land with quite an earth-shaking thud. I mean, this guy was
BIG!
My only concern about the horses was that (at least the three I rode) they
all
seemed heavy in the hands. All the horses I saw wore running martingales. It
seems to be something common in the training there. Ok, ok, so I'm getting
picky.

The instructors, were also great. All the guests seemed happy with their
lessons. Of the two instructors I had, both were better than what we
normally
see at GGPS (Will the Marin crowd please loose the smirks), and one was on
par
with Lisa McCluskey. I was very pleased. It seems that the instructors talk
amongst themselves about the students. Several of us had the experience of
changing instructors who made comments about our previous lessons. All hacks
are
led by someone from the stable (for the singers in the group, there is one
girl
who has some ditty going most of the ride).

So my typical day was up at 7:00 to watch the sun rise (In December, it
rises
all day and never quite gets anywhere) and take a walk. At 8:30, breakfast
was
served. At 9:30, the first hack went out and the first lessons started.
Lunch
could be had at the house or a short drive took us to a couple of small
villages
where we would find the local pub. One has to remember that Guinness, while
for
strength, is not for enhancing one's riding in the afternoon. The last
lessons
begin at 3:30. Much to my pleasure, that left about 3 hours before dinner.
Plenty of time for a nap, maybe some reading, a hot bath and tea, and then
downstairs to sit by the fire and have cocktails with the other guests.
Dinner
was served at 7:30, followed by coffee and after-dinner drinks, again, by
the
fire. All-in-all, quite lovely. I am beginning to better understand the why
the
English so cherish tradition. If you were wealthy, it was a damn fine
tradition.

There is plenty for non-riders as well. The Exmoor National Forest is just
as
accessible to hikers as it is to riders. At least two small villages are
within
20 minutes walk. With a car, a lot of good touring could be done down the
coast
towards lands end. If one is low on motivation, hanging around the house
would
actually make for a fine day or two.

And so, I've already told them that I will be bringing a small contingent of
ex-colonists next summer. Helen suggested early June, as it is before the
heavy
tourist season, but late enough that the cross-country courses should be dry
for
good footing. They do not like to accept groups of more than 8 people, you
will
need to bring a UK standard certified helmet for all but the flat work, and
they
have a strict weight limit of 189 pounds (they do turn down guests in
excess)
for riders.

Discuss amongst yourselves. I'm sure we could have a good time somewhere
else,
but why risk it.

Jeff.

What about dinner out? Do we still want to do that? If so, dates that work

Have a great time at Mom's party next week.  Add my best wishes for any and

Hi!

I would like to introduce you to a new service that you would find useful:
http://www.jobreviews.com

JobReviews.Com offers interview, salary, and job position reviews so that
any current or aspiring job hunter can get the inside scoop on actual
interview scenarios, salary offers, and prospective jobs.

I think this service is especially appropriate during this time of year
since the recruiting season is in full swing!

Check it out, and if possible, please forward this e-mail to your friends.

Thank you!

Julie Bard
Marketing Associate, JobReviews.com

JobReviews.COM

they
sign the hiring contract, it's too late to back out!

-INTERVIEW REVIEWS from people who have gone through the
process themselves

-SALARY REVIEWS featuring information from actual job offers

-JOB POSITION REVIEWS detailing what a job is actually like

All good - very busy this summer, training and managing 4 research
assistants (thanking God for my LECG and Tilden experience), finishing up my
first big project, and analysing lots of very interesting data.  Went to
Moscow and Berlin for 10 days early this month, and we just bought a house
and moved.  Yikes!

How are you?  How's school, I assume you go straight through the summer?

I'm actually going to be in CA from August 9-21; I'd love to grab lunch one
day if you're around.

Amy

Lari:
Glad to hear you had a great trek...my, my 21 people! You have your
hands full! Sounds like it is time for Ron to buy a house in Mendicino
too. I hope he is doing well.

We'll pick up sandwiches each morning in Westport, what do you and
Harvey like?

It'll be great fun to explore new trails. As far as my mount, Fierra is
always a blast but if you want to give her a rest I'm pleased to ride
Russia, Stoli, San Francisco or anyone you prefer. I am also happy to
ride a different mount each day. What ever is best for you and the
horses. This is such a treat for me...talk about heaven! I know all of
us feel the same way and I hope you know how great we all think you are
and your horses.

I haven't had a second to check in with Jazon regarding Virginia City.
Have you heard anything? I sure wish each race had a web site!

Madeleine

Hello fellow equinephiles,

I received positive responses (Anything other than 'Yes' is bad, very, very 
bad
- downright Negative) from Madeleine & Rob, Nora, and Pat. Carl sounds like he
is interested, but has other things on his mind at the moment. Alice has some
silly concern about a roof over her head, saying that she needs to take care 
of
the house first. If anyone else is considering the trip, please let me know
soon.

The big question is about the timing. Rob and Nora have expressed a preference
for August. Pat is trying to get Intel to spring for her airfare by calling 
it a
business trip (can you say, "Junket"). Because Pat has only the best interest 
of
the company in mind, she feels April would be a good time to go. My preference
is to go just before or after the tourist season, which would be the beginning
of June or September.

The folks at Porlock advised me thus: Depending on the wetness of the winter
season, the outdoor jump arenas and x-country courses open in early May to 
early
June. By mid June, the local tourist season is in full-swing. Bookings will be
more difficult, and we will have to compete with a good bit of traffic on the
roads and trails during hacks. Hikers use the same trails that we will canter.
The tourist season lasts through August, when much of Europe and the UK are
taking Summer holidays.

So, please help me find a time that is suitable for everyone. My vote is to go
at the end of August - Beginning of September. What do you think of that?

Jeff.

PS - Pat, I am only kidding. What's the point of working for a multi-national 
if
you can't get some good trips out of it?

Congratulations to 2 new weekly winners and our first repeat:  JAM took 1st
for the week and Prentice was 3rd.  Nancy had her second weekly win, placing
2nd.

Barrie maintains her rookie of the year honors even though she had a very
bad week, and Donna who ended in last place last year is now in 6th place.

Big ranking swaps - JAM went from 14th to a tie for 3rd and Prentice went
from 11th to a tie for 3rd.  The bottom 5 remained unchanged -

Week 3 results are on the Week #3 tab.  Cumulative payouts are on the Payout
tab.  Cumulative points are on the Total tab.

My regular e-mail is working fine:  eldon@interx.net.  If you send your
picks by e-mail, please use this address.

Washington Times
October 13, 1999 (Circulation: 106,852)

HEADLINE: "Wine of the Week"
AUTHOR: Paul Lukacs
SUMMARY:
Recommended:
* 1997 Robert Mondavi Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon North Coast-This full-bodied 
wine is an excellent value.  It outperforms many $20 cabernets by offering a 
delicious combination of brawn and finesse.  Rich black-fruit flavors combine 
with firm but not oppressive tannins to produce a wine that feels silky but 
tastes rich and powerful.  Drink this cabernet with full-flavored meat 
dishes-steaks and chops, roast beef or rack of lamb. ($12)

Opus vertical tasting ratings:
* 1979 Opus One-(91)
* 1980 Opus One-(90)
* 1981 Opus One-(87)
* 1982 Opus One-(94)
* 1983 Opus One-(88)
* 1984 Opus One-(85)
* 1985 Opus One-(87)
* 1986 Opus One-(87)
* 1987 Opus One-(88)
* 1988 Opus One-(88)
* 1989 Opus One-(90)
* 1990 Opus One-(90)
* 1991 Opus One-(92)
* 1992 Opus One-(93)
* 1993 Opus One-(92)
* 1994 Opus One-(94)
* 1995 Opus One-(95)
* 1996 Opus One-(93) Has very fine cassis, clove, currant, smoke and cedar 
aromas.  Softer then the '95, with great harmony and finesse.  Not for the 
long term, but drinks beautifully now.
* 1997 Opus One-(95) Bottled last spring, it will be released in the fall of 
2000.  Shows lots of toasty oak, with grapey, earthy notes.  Despite its 
youth it's already supple and harmonious.  Really wonderful mouthfeel, with 
sweet tannins.  Great fruit, opulent, very rich, very great quality.
1998 Opus One-(95) Still in barrel.  Almost black in color.  Smells very 
young and jammy.  Has gobs of youthful berry fruit.  Just a scamp now, but 
already rich, complex and opulent.  Should be very fine some day

Jeff:
Great! Give me just a couple of days to confirm the exact date. Go ahead and
write Lari to see when she is available as she'll probably be the hardest
person to juggle around.

Now here is a question for you....Rob has been wanting to go up to RRR and
check it out but he'd probably be 1/2 day on the beach as other non-riders
have been with us in the past. Would this be ok with you or shall I schedule
with him for another time? I'm easy either way. Besides Rob the only other
people could possibly be Jeff or Alice as the girls (Nora, Kari, Pat) are hot
on the summer show circuit. I could always ask, just let me know.

Would you like me to call the B&B we stayed at and get their availability?
What is the name?

Madeleine

For safe keeping today I reserved:solarium room; walden; redwood suite for
22nd, 23th, 24th. Great that Prentice can come! If she doesn't want to go on a
longer ride maybe she and Rob could cut off early...all depends on what she
wants and if Rob comes along. I'm all up for inviting Carl. I think he might
have a consulting gig in VA but I'm not sure. Want me to send an email to the
gang? I'm up for riding on Friday, Sat and 1/2 day on sunday or one day less.
Let me know your preference. Will you coordinate with Lari?

I am so sorry for the delay! I wanted to make sure I had a better idea of my
schedule. I am thinking the following..either the weekend of the 8th, 9th; the
29th or 30th. I may go to Chicago the 15th or 22nd which I'll know about 
within
the next couple of days thus one more weekend may open up. What are your
thoughts? Do you want to check Lari's schedule? Anyone else we should ask?

We missed you on Sunday. The whole gang was there minus Lisa. Carl leaves in 2
weeks. They decided to move because he felt his career with the City would
never go where he wanted it to go. I can explain the rest later.
