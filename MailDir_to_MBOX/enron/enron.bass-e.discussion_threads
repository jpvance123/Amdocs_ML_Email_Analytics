Dear Santa Claus:

We were good boys and girls last year, so please don't bring us a lump of 
coal again.  If you feel the need to bring us something black, the Saint 
Arnold Winter Stout will be available before Christmas.  If you take them out 
of the six pack, they will fit into our stockings, but please let us know so 
we can reinforce the hooks our stockings hang on.  Here are some other things 
on our Christmas list.  Some are events that we would like all of our friends 
to attend.

What I want for Christmas:

1. A case of Christmas Ale, but please buy it quickly because the distributor 
only has a week of inventory left right now.  That won't last until 
Christmas.  I understand that there may be a deal on it at a large warehouse 
store, but I'm not allowed to tell you where.  Do you remember the name of 
the protagonist of "Green Eggs and Ham"?

2. All my friends to come to our Toys for Tots Bratwurst Promotion Friday, 
December 8 at the Midtown Station, 2306 Brazos, 713-522-1041.  It is from 
6pm-9pm.  Bring an unwrapped toy.  The Marines will be there (they administer 
the program) to collect the toys for the underprivileged.  Everyone should 
make a point of doing something charitable during the holiday season.  It 
will make you enjoy it even more.

3. A new St. Arnold Wants You t-shirt.  All my friends already have one.

4. All my friends to come to the 6th Annual Celtic Christmas at the Garden in 
the Heights, Sunday, December 17 from 12:00 noon - 11:00 pm.  If you bring 
this email with you, you get a $2 discount off the door price. Regular 
prices: $12.00 at the door, $8.00 advance, children 12 and under are admitted 
free. Entertainment: Seven Nations, The Flying Fish Sailors, Godfreys 
Rangers, Celtic Rebellion Dancers, The Battle of the Oak King & the Holly 
King.

5. A new St. Arnold fishing hat.  You know, the floppy canvas type with an 
embroidered St. Arnold logo on it.  It's the height of fashion.

6. A president-elect.

7. A six-pack of Amber Ale every week of the year.  

8. A (choose one) nubile young lady or strapping young buck to rub scented 
massage oil into my shoulders.

9. A warm St. Arnold sweatshirt to wear on these cold, December nights in 
case you don't bring me number 8.

10. A Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, or Jolly Kwaanza and a Happy New Year.

Love,

Saint Arnold's Army

Eric-

Here's the 10 year basis curves, per Ed.  Note that the Carthage curve is 
calculated as a differential from Ship.  It's based on an analysis of 1998 
Gas Daily spreads.

Thanks,
James

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)
Total Value =                                   $172,000

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

suggestion... make a playbook that just shows individual routes.. that way 
Luis can just customize  in the huddle....

Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc...     


also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll 
out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... 

AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel....

as they=01,re  expecting snow in Denver but I=01,m not too worried about ho=
w it=01,ll=20
effect  Anderson.

Ron Dayne (NYG) vs  Steeler Defense?? This was the type of game they  draft=
ed=20
Dayne for.? A ground war vs  Pittsburgh in December.? It=01,s not  likely t=
he=20
Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode  whic=
h=20
means pretty much no Dayne.?  This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit=
h=20
Bettis on one side and  Warren on the other.

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Sammy Morris  / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs Colts Defense??  Keep an eye on who c=
an=20
go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will  likely have some good=
=20
rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana.? There were some semi encouraging=
=20
signs  that Morris might be back. The Colts rank just # 25 over the last 4=
=20
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? They=01,re  soft on the run and=
=20
someone could make a big splash on Monday  Night.?

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense?? Just as they are with their pass =
=20
defense, the Saints rush defense is overrated.? Over the last four weeks,=
=20
they rank # 23  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? And  Garner is liable =
to=20
explode at any time.?  He=01,s too good in both the rushing and passing gam=
e to=20
consider sitting  down unless you=01,re just loaded.?

Warrick Dunn  (TB) vs Miami Defense?? It was surprising to me to see the =
=20
Dolphins slide this far on rush defense.?  Over the last four weeks, they=
=20
rank # 23 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? Doesn=01,t seem  right but t=
hat=01,s=20
what the numbers say.?  Either way, Dunn=01,s a must start given what he=01=
,s done=20
lately.?=20

Robert Smith  (Min) vs Ram Defense?? Like the passing defense, the Rams  ru=
sh=20
defense has improved over the year.?  It doesn=01,t matter though.?  You=01=
,ve got=20
to start Robert Smith.?  End of story.? He may be the  best RB in the leagu=
e=20
if truth be told.???

Emmitt Smith  (Dal) vs Redskin Defense?? I think I may be the only one who =
=20
sees it this way, but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real=20
statement  for Smith.? Sure, he still may not  get the 3rd down carries as=
=20
they get a look at Michael Wiley but  Emmitt is pretty much working without=
 a=20
net here.? He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a=
=20
tough Tampa team.?  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in=
=20
their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when=20
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing=
=20
yards allowed per  game so they=01,re very beatable.?

Tony  Richardson (KC) vs Panther Defense??  Another week, another RB shakeu=
p=20
in KC as this time it=01,s Kimble Anders  who=01,s out of the mix.? I hones=
tly =20
have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it=
=20
looks  like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now.? The Panthe=
rs=20
can be run on.? Keep an eye on the weather in this one  as the passing game=
=20
could be limited.



James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense?? What a mess Chicago finds itself =
=20
in.? The messiah QB is now healthy  but still on the bench while the =01&gu=
ru=018=20
offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both=
=20
starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries.? James Allen may be the =
=20
bright spot as he=01,s run hard and effectively.? The New England defense c=
an=20
be  vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on=
=20
Allen to  carry a heavy load.

?

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Edgerrin James (Ind) vs Bills  Defense??  Edgerrin may be  having one of th=
e=20
best =01&poor=018 seasons in NFL history.? He=01,s posting great numbers ov=
erall but =20
you=01,ll have a hard time finding a James owner who=01,s real happy with h=
im.? If=20
he=01,s your guy, you have very little  choice but to start him in the Mond=
ay=20
Night game.? The Colts are tougher at home and  hopefully they won=01,t fin=
d=20
themselves playing catchup again.? Although with his receiving ability,  he=
=01,s=20
still active in that situation but it=01,s not the ideal scenario for any R=
B =20
when his team is playing from behind.?  The Bills rank # 18 over the last=
=20
four weeks in rushing yards allowed per  game so it=01,s a pretty average=
=20
rushing  defense.?

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) vs Jets  Defense?? I=01,ll keep an eye on this one fo=
r =20
you but I=01,m hearing while the ankles may be better, a broken finger may =
be =20
giving him trouble.? Some are  speculating this is the cause of his 2 fumbl=
es=20
last week.? The Jets play pretty solid rush defense  so it=01,s truly a mat=
chup=20
that could go either way.? I=01,ll try to see what I can find out on  this =
one.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Jaguar  Defense?? The Pittman injury watch=20
continues  as he=01,s still battling turf toe.? He  sat out of practice Thu=
rsday=20
and may not know his status until Friday or  Saturday.? If he can=01,t go, =
it=20
looks  like Clarence Williams could get the start.? If you=01,re scrambling=
 for=20
RBs, he=01,s  likely available in your league.?  Even assuming Pittman can =
go,=20
it=01,s not a great matchup as the Jags have  picked up the level of their =
play=20
lately.?

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Buccaneer Defense??  Don=01,t let the Buc defense scar=
e=20
you.? They=01,re a very good unit but as Emmitt  Smith proved last week, a=
=20
determined rusher can fare ok there.? Lamar Smith surely falls under that =
=20
=01&determined=018 class.? If he=01,s your  guy, I=01,d still go with him.?=
 Tampa  ranks=20
# 16 over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game.? They=01,re=
=20
allowing an average of 108 yards  per game over that time so it=01,s not li=
ke=20
they=01,re Baltimore (48 yards per game  over their last 3)

?

Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Raider Defense??  Like Tampa, the Raiders rush defen=
se=20
has a bark that=01,s a little worse  than their bite.? They=01,re solid but=
  not a=20
defense that sends RBs running for cover.? They rank # 17 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  Martin looked great last week=
=20
and looks to be guy they=01,re counting on to  carry the offense.? =20

?

Eddie George (Ten) vs Bengal  Defense?? Most people have this image in  the=
ir=20
heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run.? Not so.? Over the=
=20
last four weeks, only 8 teams  are tougher in allowing rushing yards per=20
game.? Maybe that=01,s because teams choose to  pass the ball where Cincinn=
ati=20
is weak but the bottom line is teams don=01,t run a  tremendous amount on t=
hem.?=20
However,  if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee,? you=01,=
ll=20
see a team that runs the ball as  their 1st, 2nd and 3rd option.? (pretty=
=20
much their style with a healthy  McNair too=01()?? George is a must  start =
even=20
though it=01,s no slam dunk on the matchup.

?

James Stewart (Det) vs Packer Defense??  Depending on the weather and Charl=
ie=20
Batch=01,s ribs, Stewart could be asked  to carry the load this week.? Gree=
n =20
Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on=
 =20
defense.? On the flip side, they=01,re  playing pretty stingy rush defense=
=20
averaging 104 rushing yards allowed per game  over their last 4 which ranks=
=20
them # 14.? =20

??

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Brad Hoover (Car)  vs Chief Defense??  With Tshimanga  Biakabutuka revertin=
g=20
back to his normal =01&can=01,t stay healthy=018 form he=01,s  displayed fo=
r most of his=20
career, Hoover gets another shot this week.? The Chiefs are tough at home a=
nd=20
the  weather could be a factor (possibly in his favor) but Hoover will take=
=20
his power  rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares.? Kansas City=
=20
ranks # 8 over the last four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so th=
ey=01,
re pretty  solid.

Travis Prentice /  Jamel White (Cle) vs Eagle Defense?? Neither of these gu=
ys=20
is doing a  great job and they=01,ll both likely struggle against an Eagle =
team=20
that=01,s serious  about defense.? If it were me, I=01,d  look elsewhere if=
 these=20
were my guys.

Marshall Faulk  (Stl) vs Viking Defense?? While they=01,re under appreciate=
d, =20
the Viking rush defense is pretty good.?  Over the last four weeks, they ra=
nk=20
# 11 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? They=01,ll have all they want  wi=
th=20
Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher one=01,s Faulk will  f=
ace.?=20
He=01,s still a no brainer to  start regardless of the opponent.?  He=01,s=
=20
reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being  worried=
=20
about them both.? Coach Mike  Martz has talked about using him on special=
=20
teams to help turn that unit  around.

J.R. Redmond /  Patrick Pass / Kevin Faulk (NE) vs Bears Defense??  With=20
Redmond still ailing, the Patriot RB situation is a mess.? And Bill Belichi=
ck=20
certainly isn=01,t  shedding much light on anything.?  Unless Redmond shows=
 he=20
can be 100%, I=01,d probably shy away from all 3 of  them as it=01,s too mu=
ch of a=20
shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick.? The Bears are playing pretty=
=20
tough rush  defense with rookie sensation Brian  Urlacher.

Ahman Green (GB)  vs Lion Defense?? One bright spot for the Packers  this=
=20
year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green.? Coach Mike Holmgren in=
=20
Seattle could  have likely saved a # 1 pick on Alexander if Green was still=
=20
in Seattle.? Green=01,s always had the physical skills  but he lagged behin=
d in=20
other areas.?  Now, he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up=
 =20
significantly and the results are showing on the field.? It=01,s a tough ma=
tchup=20
as the Lions rank #  7 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game but I think he=01,s up  for it.

??

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Ricky  Watters (Sea) vs Bronco Defense?? Denver evidently didn=01,t take  k=
indly=20
to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago  =
as=20
they=01,ve been tough against the run since then.? Over the last four weeks=
,=20
they rank # 2  in rushing yards allowed  per game allowing just 57 yards pe=

game.? Watters is a solid player and not unlike  an Emmitt Smith, he=01,s a=
 guy=20
that=01,s made a living performing against the tough  teams in tough games.=
? So=20
it=01,s not  like I=01,m terrified of this matchup.?  Just be aware, it=01,=
s a tough=20
one.?  One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has=
=20
said  at some point, he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander,=20
especially in the  passing game.? How much he=01,d like to  see isn=01,t kn=
own=20
right now.?

Terrell  Fletcher (SD) vs Baltimore Defense??  Let=01,s not go there.? =20
Baltimore is allowing an average of 48 yards rushing per game over their =
=20
last 3 games.? I don=01,t see Fletcher  as the guy who breaks that trend.?

Jerald Moore  / Chad Morton / Terry Allen (NO)? vs  49er Defense??? Early=
=20
this week, both Moore  and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss=
=20
Sunday=01,s game.? They appear to be healing ahead of  schedule and now it =
looks=20
like both may play.? Allen spent time running with the first  unit in=20
practice so it=01,s really murky right now.? I=01,d tend to shy away from a=
ll these=20
guys  as I think they=01,ll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did =
last =20
week.? Besides, the 49ers are  deceptively stingy against the rush ranking =
#=20
3 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.???

Corey Dillon  (Cin) vs Titan Defense?? Yes, this is a tough matchup.? But s=
o=20
was Denver and the jersey Dillon  wore in that particular tough matchup is=
=20
now hanging in Canton, Ohio.? I learned (and I hope you did too) to go  wit=
h=20
the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent.? Tennessee is very go=
od=20
in defending the  rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon=20
unless you=01,re just  loaded.?

Jamal Lewis  (Bal) vs Charger Defense?? Lewis is clearly the class of the =
=20
rookie crop offensively.? I hear  some say they think his early season elbo=
w=20
injury was actually a blessing as it  let him stay fresh.? I don=01,t know =
=20
about that but I do know he=01,s running very hard and effectively.? He doe=
s=20
draw a tough matchup this week  against a Charger defense that=01,s only=20
allowing 81 rushing yards per game over  the last 4 games which earns them =
a=20
ranking of # 5.? Still though, you pretty much have to  ride Lewis if he=01=
,s=20
your guy.?

Jerome  Bettis (Pit) vs Giant Defense?? This could be a classic battle =20
between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis.? Bettis lives for the=
se=20
kind of games and  he=01,ll get to lay it on the line Sunday.?  He=01,s a l=

starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the  rush.? Over th=
e=20
last four weeks,  they rank # 6 in rushing  yards allowed per game.?  I=01,=

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/28/00 
 Connell's status for Sunday's game against the Giants is seriously in 
doubt.  He sprained his knee in last week's game against the Eagles, and Head 
Coach Norv Turner has already stated that Connell will not start.  This 
should serve notice to Fantasy owners who have Connell on their roster not to 
put him in their lineup this week.      

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has stated that Fryar will get the start this week 
against the Giants.  He had four catches for 50 yards in last week's loss to 
the Eagles, and could see extended playing time if Albert Connell is unable 
to play for the 'Skins.  Fryar isn't the type of receiver you want to depend 
on for production, especially with the Fantasy league playoffs looming.  
Consider another option if your roster allows it.      

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Washington wideout caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in 
last Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  He seemed to thrive with Jeff George under 
center, but now that Brad Johnson is back from injury, it may be a return to 
mediocrity.  Thrash could, however, see some looks this week if Albert 
Connell's knee injury keeps him from playing extended minutes.       

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Harris sprained his left knee in last week's loss to the Vikings.  However, 
the injury shouldn't keep Harris from playing this week as Dallas travels to 
Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers.  After a fast start, Harris has really been 
quieted by opposing defenses in recent weeks.  He is a good backup tight end 
in most Fantasy leagues, but his inconsistent numbers keep him from being an 
every week starter.      

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 The Doomsday Defense has now become The M.A.S.H. unit.  The Cowboys lost yet 
another player on Monday when defensive end Peppi Zellner tore his ACL in 
practice, effectively ending his season. Zellner now joins Leon Lett (knee), 
George Teague (foot), Chad Hennings (neck) and Darren Woodson (arm) on the 
long list of defensive players who have been injured this season.  Only 
Woodson is still available to the team, but his status for this week's game 
at Tampa Bay is still uncertain. With all of the injuries on defense coupled 
with a brutal final four weeks of the season, it would be a good idea to drop 
Dallas' unit before the playoffs.    

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/28/00 
 Smith, who suffered a concussion on Thanksgiving Day against the Vikings, is 
expected to start this Sunday at Tampa Bay.  He was held out of practice on 
Monday for precautionary reasons but will return to the field for Dallas' 
first full practice of the week on Wednesday. Dallas is likely to give Smith 
the ball quite a bit on Sunday, as they attempt to establish the run against 
a tough Bucs' defense.     

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/28/00 
 Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants.  Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner.      

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/28/00 
 It's official - Rams Coach Mike Martz has announced that Warner will be his 
starting quarterback against Carolina on Sunday. This is good news for 
Fantasy owners of Rams players, as the team is a lot stronger offensively 
when Warner is taking the snaps.  

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Price caught six passes for 44 yards in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers.  He 
has been a major disappointment this season to Fantasy owners who took a 
chance on him.  In fact, Price hasn't caught a touchdown pass since Week One 
against the Titans. Unless you are involved in a deep league, look elsewhere 
for a reserve wideout.     

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Riemersma caught five passes for 82 yards in Sunday's 31-17 loss to the 
Buccaneers. Although he may not post solid numbers every week, his production 
is consistent enough to warrant a starting spot in many Fantasy leagues.  
Keep Riemersma on you roster as the playoffs approach.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 The Bengals have upgraded Mitchell's condition from questionable to probable 
for next Sunday's game against Arizona. Coach Dick LeBeau has not yet named 
his starter for that game, although Mitchell would give the Cincinnati 
offense its best shot at solid Fantasy numbers.  

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Smith completed 10 of 20 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown Sunday against 
Pittsburgh, and the Bengals applauded his efforts in the game. His teammates 
said he was as sharp and confident on the field as he's been all season. 
Coach Dick LeBeau hasn't yet named his starter for next Sunday, although we 
wouldn't recommend either Cincinnati quarterback at this stage of the Fantasy 
season.  

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Moulds had a huge day against the Bucs, catching eight passes while 
accounting for 122 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Look for Moulds to 
post good numbers this week against the Dolphins, a team who he has 
absolutely killed in the past.      

 Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson led the Browns with four catches for 85 yards Sunday against 
Baltimore, although most of that was due to a 67-yard reception that set up a 
Browns touchdown on the game's first drive. He's the closest thing to a 
viable Fantasy starter on the Browns, although the lack of a reliable passing 
game will limit his value over the season's final weeks.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Coach Chris Palmer has become increasingly frustrated with Northcutt in 
recent weeks, according to the Akron Beacon Journal . Northcutt has been 
dropping too many passes and committing costly fumbles, including one on a 
punt return Sunday against Baltimore. He had no catches on the day. Palmer is 
likely to start Northcutt the rest of the season, but he's not a recommended 
Fantasy receiver.  

 Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Alexander had a productive day for Washington, catching four passes for 39 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Eagles.  The 'Skins tight end 
hasn't been consistent at all this season, however, so use another option at 
the position if at all possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Pederson completed just eight of 16 passes for 108 yards and an interception 
Sunday against Baltimore before being lifted in the second quarter for backup 
Spergon Wynn. We don't recommend Pederson over the season's final weeks, as 
the Browns' offense is showing how much injuries have depleted it this year.  

 Spergon Wynn , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Wynn, who replaced Doug Pederson at the start of the second half of Sunday's 
game against Baltimore, wasn't overly successful in the 18 plays he was a 
part of. He completed five of nine passes, but they went for just 30 yards, 
and he was sacked four times, losing a fumble once. Coach Chris Palmer 
continues to say he wants to bring Wynn along slowly, and the Browns' offense 
is reeling, so don't expect much from him over the season's final weeks.  

 Chris Redman , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Redman was called upon during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland, although he did not attempt a pass. Unless Baltimore runs away 
with any of its next three games, he will likely not see any more action this 
season.  

 Matt Stover , K BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Stover kicked three field goals Sunday against Cleveland, breaking his 
single-season mark of 29 and passing the 1,000-point mark for his career. He 
added five extra points and now has an NFL-best 116 points on the season. 
Unless you hear otherwise, Stover should be a permanent fixture in your 
starting lineup for the remainder of the season.  

 David Akers , K PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Akers kicked two field goals against the Redskins, including what turned out 
to be the game winner.  He connected on boots of 33 and 30 yards, and has now 
kicked nine field goals in his last three games. Look for Akers' success to 
continue this week against the Titans, in game where the placekickers could 
play a major role in the final score.    

 Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Talk about a good touchdown percentage - Thomason has caught only nine 
passes all year, but five have been for a touchdown.  Although he does seem 
to get into the end zone quite a bit, don't let the numbers fool you.  Unless 
you are in a deeper Fantasy league, Thomason won't be a reliable option when 
it comes time for your playoffs to begin.  

 Sam Gash , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Gash, making his sixth start in place of injured Obafemi Ayanbadejo, had a 
two-yard touchdown pass in yesterday's game against Cleveland. Don't take 
that to mean he's a sleeper over the remainder of the season; Gash had just 
one other catch (for six yards) in the game and will continue to serve almost 
entirely as a blocker, a role he is perfectly-suited for.  

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/00 
 King was rather mediocre against the Bills Sunday.  He completed 10-of-18 
passes for 106 yards.  King has now gone two consecutive games without 
throwing a touchdown pass.  That should change this week when he faces a 
Dallas defense with an almost nonexistent pass rush.  The Cowboys have a 
league worst 17 sacks this season.  King's offensive line will provide him 
with plenty of time to pick the Cowboys' secondary apart.    

 Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/00 
 Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.  

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson has been very unproductive over Philadelphia's last five games, 
compiling only only eleven catches and 94 yards receiving.  None of 
Philadelphia's receivers, including Johnson, is worth wasting a roster spot 
on at this point.  Look for better reserve wideouts before your playoffs 
begin.    

 Torrance Small , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Small could only haul in one pass for 18 yards against the Redskins.  He has 
been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners who took a chance on him, 
catching only one pass in four of his last five games.  It's time to look for 
an alternative to Small if he is still on your roster.    

 Tony Banks , QB BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 
 Banks was called on during the third quarter of Sunday's game against 
Cleveland after it was well out of hand. He completed just two of three 
passes for 45 yards, but looked respectable in a reserve role. Although 
that's good news for the Ravens, don't read into this as a sign he'll get 
much, if any, playing time during Baltimore's final three games.  

 Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 
 Johnson is struggling once again.  He had just two catches for 15 yards 
against the Bills Sunday.  After catching four TDs in three games, Johnson 
has just four catches in the last two.    

 Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Lewis was solid in Sunday's win over Washington, catching six passes for 53 
yards in the game.  He has had three consecutive productive games after a bit 
of a mid-season slump, and should get a number of looks this week against 
Tennessee. Keep him in the starting lineup as your Fantasy playoffs 
approach.

Emergency funds needed: https://secure.apk.net/gb/contribute.html

On Election Night, George W. Bush won the most votes in Florida.
Not surprisingly, Al Gore's campaign did not like the result.  They
immediately dispatched lawyers to Florida and had a Washington
lobbyist raise $3 million in one day to fund Gore's Florida operation.

Unfortunately, the Gore camp refuses to accept the Election Night
count or the 2nd computer count or even, in some instances, a 3rd
computer count.  Now they want a hand count, even though computer
counts are more precise and objective.  On top of that, they have only
asked for hand counts in counties that are overwhelmingly Democratic.

We have the high ground.  We're poised to win.  But we need your help
to defend the integrity of the Florida election.

RECOUNT FUND NOW:

PLEASE SEND THIS TO AS MANY CONCERNED AMERICANS AS YOU KNOW.

Unlike the Gore Campaign, which is accepting donations from
contributors whose name and contributions they are refusing to
disclose, the Bush Cheney Recount Fund will limit contributions to
$5,000 and disclose its donors on our Website.

Thank you for all you've done to help elect Governor Bush and
Secretary Cheney.  Your continued commitment and generosity during
this important time in the life of our country is greatly appreciated.

This is Funny!

A man was doing a study of children's senses in a
first-grade class using Lifesaver candies .  He would ask them to
identify the color and then the flavor as they tasted the Lifesaver.
The children began to say,

"Red...cherry"
"Yellow...lemon"
"Green...lime"
"Orange...orange"

Finally, he gave them all honey flavored Lifesavers. The
children sucked on them for a while, but they couldn't decipher the
taste. "Well" he said, "I'll give you a clue.  It's what your
mother would call your father!" One little girl looked up in horror.  She
quickly spit the  Lifesaver out and shouted, "Everybody, spit it out.
They're assholes!"

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like "Spring Break Everyday!"  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got "Tanked" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying "I DO" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,"Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?"  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - "Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?"  He responded, "Have the odds come out already?!?"  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his "Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut " to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as "Mullet of the Week"  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, "A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper."   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

CKL

?




Dear Eric,  
It's Election Day in the United States so we want to encourage  everyone to 
get out and vote! Unlike the current race, with  our vacation specials, you 
don't have to choose just one! You  can visit the home of the next President

If you have a scale at home, and you know what the weight limit  is, then you 
can weigh your bags at home - and if your bag is too  heavy, then you need to 
lighten your load by removing non-essential  items. -Sabrina O.

UT's uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them. Here are some o=
f=20
the responses ...=20
=09
=09 =20
=09
=09One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their =
=20
uniforms. I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the  classiest=
,=20
coolest uniforms in the country! I admit to being biased, but  love the=20
simple, non-busy look of the all-white uniforms. I also have no  problem wi=
th=20
the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested. The  white helmets=
=20
with the simple, yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as  pronounced a=
s=20
the "star" on the Dallas Cowboys' helmet. While I agree with him about the=
=20
black shoes, I think any changes to "individualize" or  otherwise change=20
their "look" would be a move in the wrong direction. - Rick Peurifoy=20
=09
=09 I was interested in John Pharr's comments about the UT uniforms. Having=
 been=20
at UT in the 1960s, I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go. I=
=20
certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenc=
ed=20
by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans=20
individual name on back and "TEXAS" on the front), with the plain white pan=
ts=20
and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but=
=20
the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the=20
"candy-striped" pants (ala OU) and added the "TEXAS" to the jersey.=20
Personally I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings=
=20
would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One=
=20
amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the=
=20
uniforms; his response was that these are "work clothes" and not intended t=
o=20
be fancy. I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac=
k=20
a long way. I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the=
=20
Longhorn in the early 1960s, but it didn't add much. Keep up the good work.=
 I=20
always enjoy your newsletter. - Tom Thornell=20
=09
=09 Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are amo=
ng=20
the sharpest anywhere. If we change the helmets, then we look like a high=
=20
school team. What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are=
=20
orange and white. Period. So what if it doesn't have too much color? I hope=
=20
we stay exactly the same. Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an=

added orange pants? They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field.=

seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt, although one could argue=
=20
that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year. Stil=
l,=20
since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank=
ed=20
after five passes, a redshirt seems like a reach. If he doesn't redshirt,=
=20
what is=20
=09
=09the best guess for Texas QB in 2001? I know that you get asked this ever=
y=20
week, but with the new development following the A=02?game, it seems that w=
e are=20
starting fresh in this story.=20
=09?? Kyle Moore=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Simms' big-time performance against A=02?adds all kinds of new =
wrinkles=20
to the landscape for 2001. My best guess is Simms will get the start for th=
e=20
bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this=
=20
season. Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again=
=20
gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into t=
he=20
spring and next fall. Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a=
=20
rotation again. But one would have to think after the sluggish start the=20
offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be=20
reluctant to do that again. Despite breaking nearly every passing record at=
=20
Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his las=
t=20
outings before getting injured. Simms would seem to have everything going h=
is=20
way. The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie=
r=20
this season. Now that they've seen it, you would have to think that they wa=
nt=20
to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw=
o=20
years (not stick with a guy who only has one season left). I'm not saying=
=20
that's fair. But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would=20
think. But we won't know how the QB situation for 2001 will shake out until=
=20
next fall, most likely.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning, UT cou=
ld=20
have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full. Do y=
ou=20
think B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on?=
=20
Did they just blossom during the A=02?game? Otherwise, why haven't they see=
n the=20
field more?=20
=09?? A.B.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, bu=
t you=20
could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year=
=20
with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha=
ve=20
back at those positions. There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t=
he=20
fullback position was pretty average this season. So the coaches will take =
a=20
strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB. At 6-3 and 235, he has the=
=20
size. He is also quick with good hands. If Matthews doesn't add significant=
=20
oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more=
=20
one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field. But we'll see. UT coaches=
=20
did a nice job of adjusting this season to a two-back, two-receiver set aft=
er=20
they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers (with too many=
=20
formations and too many quarterbacks). Now that the receivers can probably=
=20
handle more of the playbook, look for UT to be as multiple and complex an=
=20
offense as possible next season. B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team=
's=20
second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty. Sloan Thomas was the o=
ne=20
who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions=
=20
and be ready to fill in at any of them. So he was slowed by the learning=20
process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and=20
Brandon Healy. Healy is a senior, so he'll be gone next year. Flowers shoul=
d=20
be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are=
=20
either redshirting or transferred?=20
=09?? Bart Fields=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the=
=20
sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer=
=20
Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan). Simms said=
=20
both will really help the team a lot next year. Jeffery is 6-2 and trying t=
o=20
bulk up from 170 pounds. Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170=20
pounds. But both have shown great hands in practice. The first two names th=
at=20
jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl=
=20
practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and=
=20
Rashad Thomas. With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'And=
re=20
Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new=
=20
faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at=
=20
linebacker in two years.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm a little concerned about our running backs. Next year's crop loo=
ks=20
mighty inexperienced. We never seemed to be able to run up the middle=20
consistently this year. Who would you figure has the best shot at being an=
=20
inside bruiser? What role will our fullbacks play? =20
=09?? Russell Phillips=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It's the biggest question mark on an offense that should be=20
absolutely loaded next season. I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis=
=20
and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov=
er=20
at tackle nicely. Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar=
r=20
has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good. So with a line=
=20
that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run=
=20
behind it. Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges=
=20
Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility. Coaches want Victor Ike, Ken=
ny=20
Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up. Coaches have told those=
=20

 At=20
6-3 and more than 200 pounds, he is a bit undersized but could add the=20

UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams. This=

year the Longhorns would have been 10-1 and possibly on their way to a BCS=

Getting lots of questions on Martin.  Nothing definitive yet, but here's the
latest I have from the New York Daily News by By Rich Cimini:
http://www.nydailynews.com/2000-11-22/Metro_Sports/Football/a-89509.asp
>From the article:  "The Jets provided no update yesterday on Curtis Martin,
but his injury isn't believed to be serious. His status for Sunday's game
against the Bears remains in doubt. It appears that Martin was drilled in
the tailbone by a Dolphins defender. It swelled up on the team flight back
from Miami, and ice was applied. Al Groh has declined to provide specifics,
except to say the injury occurred in the "general pelvic region."
The Jets' star running back, who underwent intensive treatment yesterday,
has told several people that he's fine. He's known for his high pain
threshold, and it wouldn't shock teammates if he played this week.

My View:  Players are notorious for being optimistic but Martin is a tough
guy.  Another reason why these Thursday games are so tough.  If you wanted
waffling, you wouldn't be signed up for this newsletter so I'm going to say
as of Wednesday morning, I think the chances he plays effectively as
normally would are 75%.
Thanks to my friend Nicholas Bollini for assistance on this one.
Good Luck this weekend.

Joe

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.


-Eric

Coping With Job Stress

  At a seminar called "Stress and Disease"  by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job
stress which I would like to share with you.

  When you have had one of those "Take This Job and Shove It" days,
try this:

On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the
section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase
a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip". BE SURE THAT YOU GET
THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,
and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your
therapy.

Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie
down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,
remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table
so that it will not become chipped or broken.

Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as
you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,
"Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested."

Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, "I am so glad that
I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company."

Hi Jason,
?
Sorry I didn't see your message til late  yesterday.? I've been researching 
our family tree and have been totally  consumed.? I believe I've traced it 
back to 1658 on your Grandpa's  side.? Isn't that fascinating?? I began this 
project for you and Eric  but, in the process, I have become consumed.? It's 
very, very  interesting.? I will organize all of this in the future so you 
and your  brother have it.? Part of the inspiration came from a book Shanna 
gave me  for my birthday.? I started to fill in some of the blanks about our 
family  and couldn't remember what Grandpa had told me.? I was saddened by 
this and  now he is gone and I cannot ask him anymore.? So, I decided to do 
something  about it. Our old family bible from 1853 gave me a good starting  
point.
?
About your resume.? I think it is wonderfully  done.? I spoke with Dad and he 
told me about his comments to you.? I  agree.? There is so much more about 
you that is good.
?
Have a good day and I'll talk to you soon.?  I'm going to copy this to Eric 
so I don't have to write it all over.? Off  to the cemeteries I go!!
?
Love you, Mom

John Cote asked me to forward this information on to any guys that I thought 
might be interested.  Apparently, he thinks I know a lot of noble men here at 
Enron.  All kidding aside, this sounds like a worthwhile thing, if you have 
the time.  If any of you are interested, contact John Cote at ext. 3-3830.

Hope everyone has a great 4th of July!
Thanks,

Oh well.  I can't win for losing.  I wish I had Horn this week too.  This is
just a busted season and I can do nothing to make it better.

Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see  the matchups this week.? Please=
 =20
note, see the cheatsheet online  http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm=
?
for exactly where I rank players  and to determine who to start.? Just =20
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't=20
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup=
=20
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to decidi=
ng=20
between players.??=20

?



Locks:? These games heavily favor the  Offense

Tennessee=01,s Eddie George vs Brown  Defense?? Assuming Eddie George can g=
et=20
his  injured toe healthy (and I think he can) he could have a monster game=
=20
against a  Brown Defense that=01,s been terrible against the rush.? For the=
=20
year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and they=
=20
rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  Th=
e=20
Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the  Ravens=
=20
and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the  Browns.

Miami=01,s Lamar Smith vs Jets  Defense?? You=01,ll have to look awfully ha=
rd  to=20
find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith.?  In their week?8 matchup, he ran for 2=
=20
TDs and 155 yards.? At the time, it seemed like a fluke but  Smith has=20
maintained almost that pace since then.? Jay Fiedler and the passing game=
=20
provide  just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does=
=20
the  rest.? Over the last four weeks, the  Jets rank # 26 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed per  game.

New York Giant=01,s Ron Dayne / Tiki  Barber vs Lion Defense?? As you know =
by=20
now, the Giants  running game is governed by how close they keep the game.?=
=20
Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground  game (especially Ron Dayne=01,s role=
)=20
when the Giants start to trail.? Against a less than explosive Lions  team,=
=20
the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of  th=
e=20
way.? Detroit=01,s been weak  defending the run over the last four weeks wh=
ere=20
they rank # 25 in rushing yards  allowed per game.? =20

Indianapolis=01, Edgerrin James vs Packer  Defense?? Green Bay=01,s allowin=
g 135=20
yards  rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them # 22.? Jam=
es=20
should continue to roll this week  against a Packer Defense that=01,s missi=
ng LB=20
Brian Williams who=01,s out with a knee  injury.? DE Vonnie Holiday may be =
=20
limited but he looks like he=01,ll play and that=01,s some concern but I st=
ill=20
look  for James to romp.

Baltimore=01,s Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy  Defense?? The Cowboys gave up their 2=
00=20
yard  rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but =
I=01,
m  guessing power running Jamal Lewis (who=01,s almost as quick as those gu=
ys)=20
will be  a great play against Dallas.? For  the season, Dallas ranks # 28 i=
n=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Look for him to catch the ball=
=20
out of  the backfield as well.

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

San Diego=01,s  Terrell Fletcher / Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense??  Ov=
er=20
the last four week, Denver ranks # 31 in rushing yards allowed per  game.??=
=20
This  game smells a lot like the Denver / Bengal game to me.? Winless team=

Corey Dillon=01,s record setting day and many remember Jermaine  Fazande=01=

day rushing in the last game of 1999 against the Broncos.? Terrell Fletcher=

is working his way into  the mix and that=01,s really muddying the waters.?=
 Keep=20
an eye on this one and if it looks  like one of these guys will garner the=
=20
bulk of the carries, he could be worth a  flyer.? =20



Philadelphia=01,s Stanley Pritchett / Darnell Autry vs  Cardinal Defense? T=
he=20
Arizona defense remains pretty weak  against the rush.? They rank # 29  in=
=20
rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.? For the year, th=
ey=20
rank # 31  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? The trick is=20
determining which Eagle RB  will get the carries.? I like  Pritchett becaus=

Autry as I believe  you=01,re supposed to have the acting career?after the=

football career, not  the other way around=01(?

Arizona=01,s  Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense??  Watch this one closely as=
=20
Pittman is struggling to get healthy with  bruised ribs.? If he can go, I=
=20
like  the matchup this week.? Philadelphia  ranks # 30 in rushing  yards=20
allowed per game over the last four weeks.? They=01,re stronger over the ye=

=20
there.?

Buffalo=01,s  Sammy Morris / Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense??  Morris battli=
ng a=20
bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision.? Bryson is plenty capable i=
f=20
he can=01,t  go.? The Chiefs are an attractive  matchup as they rank # 28 i=

rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks.? They rank # 27 i=
n=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB for the year.?  Watch this one=
=20
closely to see if the Bills offer hints to who=01,ll they=01,ll  go with.?

Green Bay=01,s  Ahman Green vs Colt Defense?? With Dorsey Levens out again,=
 =20
Green will be asked to carry the load?  The Colts are vulnerable to the rus=
h=20
ranking # 24 in rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks.? =
If=20
Brett Favre can play, that=01,ll be a  nice boost for Green as the defense =
won=01,t=20
be able to key on stopping the ground  game.?

Cincinnati=01,s  Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense?? How much would you rely =
on=20
Scot  Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau??  Me neither.? Whether it=01,s  Aki=

Smith or Scott Mitchell under center, it=01,s still the Corey Dillon  Show.=
? New=20
England has shown itself  to vulnerable against the rush ranking # 23 in=20

passing game.

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way

San Francisco=01,s Charlie Garner vs  Falcon Defense??  Charlie Garner =20
continues his great season against a Falcon team that=01,s playing better r=
ush =20
defense than it had been.? For the  year, Atlanta ranks # 30 in Fantasy=20
Points allowed to the opposing RB but over  the last four weeks, they rate =
#=20
19 in rushing yards allowed per game.? If they=01,re without WR Terrell Owe=

Pittsburgh=01,s Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar  Defense?? With the WR shuffling go=

New England=01,s J.R. Redmond / Kevin  Faulk vs Bengal Defense?? The Bengal=

tough to  predict.? For the last four weeks,  they rank # 17 in rushing yar=
ds=20
allowed per game and for the year they come in  at # 14 in Fantasy Points=
=20
allowed to the opposing RB.? But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt  Smith=
=20
last week.? I look for Redmond  and Faulk to have moderate success against=
=20
this improving unit.? Redmond is questionable with ribs so  keep an eye on=
=20
this one.?

Chicago=01,s James Allen vs Buccaneer  Defense?? As with the pass defense,=
=20
Tampa  Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation.? For the=

last four weeks, they rank # 16  in rushing yards allowed per game allowing=

106 per game.? For the year, they rate # 9 in Fantasy  Points allowed to th=

opposing RBs so it=01,s not like they=01,re invincible.? With Shane Matthew=

center and  scaring no one though, it could be a long  day.?

Washington=01,s Stephen Davis vs Ram  Defense?? As is so often the case, th=

SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not
say, Eat me"
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone..."

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

Hi Folks,

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch,  identifying those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making  the playoffs or watching from the sidelines.? As=
=20
we head into our 11th week  of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both  the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make  sur=
e=20
you understand, what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? In=
=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and Downgrades.? Some of these players are obvious moves up or  do=
wn=20
and some aren't as clear.? Here's my list of guys I see moving this  week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Jeff  Blake (NO)?? Heard a funny thing on ESPN's Monday Night  Pregame=
=20
show.? The guys said that with the troubles in St. Louis, the road  to the=
=20
Super Bowl now runs through New Orleans.? It's been a while since  you've=
=20
been able to say that.? Blake struggled in the preseason but has  become mo=
re=20
comfortable with each game.? With a great rushing game  featuring Ricky=20
Williams and a star WR in Joe Horn, Blake's looking great.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? Shannon Sharpe predicted that when the Ravens =20
finally scored a TD, they'd score a bunch of them.? The big TE was  prophet=
ic=20
as Dilfer threw for 3 TDs Sunday.? He scrambled, improvised, and  made=20
excellent decisions.? A little confidence may be all he needed.?  He doesn'=
t=20
have a stellar WR corps with Qadry Ismail, Jermaine Lewis and Patrick =20
Johnson but he does have a great TE in Sharpe and a solid RB in Jamal =20
Lewis.?=20

QB Brian  Griese? (Den)? As expected, Griese's recent off the field  troubl=
es=20
had little impact to his performance on the field.? 327 yards and  a couple=
=20
of TDs is strong against a good Jets team.? The biggest reason for  his=20
upgrade though is the smashing return of RB Terrell Davis.? If Sunday  was=
=20
any indication, this offense could make some serious noise.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? With back to back solid games, Shaun King is turning =
=20
some heads.? He only passed for 110 yards Sunday but squeezed every yard  f=
or=20
all it was worth with 3 TDs.? He continued to target Keyshawn Johnson  even=
=20
to the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldn't have been =
=20
thrown.? It's tough to rely on a QB who plays in this conservative offense =
=20
but if you're thin at QB, King might be worth a shot.

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Miller clearly gave the Bears a boost with his solid =
=20
play Sunday.? Not only was he more accurate than the injured Cade McNown,  =
he=20
showed a better arm to boot.? Miller's gain will be McNown's lost and I  lo=
ok=20
for Miller to gain plenty over the next few weeks.

QB Danny  Kanell (Atl)? Kanell came in when Chandler left with a =20
concussion.? He played pretty well with 2 TDs on 218 yards.? Chandler  look=
s=20
to possibly miss this week's game and Kanell could be a nice play against  =
a=20
Detroit Defense.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? He's made this list several times already this =20
year?but it's worth noting how good he's been lately.? Sunday's 2 TD /  125=
=20
yard day earned him the #1 RB ranking in many scoring systems.? I don't  se=
e=20
many reasons why he won't have continued success.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den)? In one of the more heartening performances of the =
=20
day, Terrell Davis looked great.? He showed the power and the burst that =
=20
we've come to expect from Davis over the years.? Coach Mike Shanahan said =
=20
during last week's practices that Davis looked as good as he'd ever seen =
=20
him.? After watching the game, I have to agree with him.?=20

RB J.R.  Redmond? (NE)?? According to coach Bill Belichick and  Boston Glob=
e=20
columnist Frank Dell'Apa, Redmond injured his foot during practice  and was=
=20
supposedly going to be limited Sunday.? Kevin Faulk was  unimpressive early=
=20
and Redmond never looked back after getting a chance.?  He's productive=20
without being impressive as he only averaged 2.8 yards per carry  on 24=20
attempts but did get the score.?=20

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? Much had been made of the Raven's troubles but Jamal=
 =20
Lewis had been running hard and effectively.? Lewis was held out of the =20
endzone once again but he rolled up 179 total yards with 109 rushing and 70=
 =20
yards receiving.? If Trent Dilfer and the passing game can keep things =20
rolling, I see no reason why Lewis can't hold up his end of the offense.

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? As you know by now, Marshall Faulk had knee surger=
y =20
Monday and will miss 2-3 weeks.? We've had Watson on our Waiver Wire Wonder=
 =20
list for a while as the guy who'd get a shot if Faulk went down.? He was =
=20
less than impressive yesterday with only 12 yards on 12 carries but he did=
=20
get  the TD.? Plus, coach Mike Martz said the game plan had been designed=
=20
around  Faulk and the skills he brings.? Look for Watson to perform better=
=20
with a  week to prepare.? Although Marshall Faulk is the only guy who'll gi=
ve=20
you  Faulk like numbers anytime soon in this offense.

RB Warrick  Dunn? Dunn had 18 carries Sunday and he continues to play a=20
bigger  role in this offense. It's coming at the expense of Mike Alstott.? =
It=20
seems  strange to see Dunn carry the load but that's exactly what he's been=
 =20
doing.? After the Minnesota game last week, Keyshawn Johnson said he told  =
QB=20
Shaun King that he needed to get the ball to "19 and 28" (Johnson and  Dunn=
)?=20
King evidently listened.? Makes you wonder who's really  coaching this team=
...

RB  Jermaine Fazande (SD)? Fazande looked to be in danger of losing  carrie=
s=20
last week but he responded Sunday with a nice day carrying the ball 22  tim=
es=20
for 74 yards (3.4 ypc) He also tacked on 37 yards receiving.? The  Chargers=
=20
are still struggling but Fazande could be a nice addition if you're  thin a=
t=20
RB.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)?? Johnson told QB Shaun King he wanted  the ball.=
?=20
King obliged and Johnson's made the most of it.? He only  had 3 receptions=
=20
for 47 yards but he managed TDs on 2 of those catches.? I  don't look for h=
im=20
to score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch  but I do thi=
nk=20
he could continue the roll.? You can bet the Bucs won't mess  around with=
=20
what's working for them.

WR Joe  Horn (NO)? Can you imagine if Elvis Grbac still had Joe Horn in  KC=
??=20
QB Jeff Blake's certainly glad to have him and Horn surely likes the  role =
of=20
the #1 WR.? He put together a great game Sunday with 167 yards on 9 =20
receptions.? WR Keith Poole isn't carrying his share of the load but RB =20
Ricky Williams is more than making up for it.

St. Louis  WRs? I'd look for Isaac Bruce, Az-zahir Hakim, and Torry Holt to=
 =20
all increase their production in the wake of Marshall Faulk's injury.? =20
Synergy can be a strange thing.? On most teams, I'd view the loss of the =
=20
star RB as a negative toward the WRs.? The Rams have so many passing  weapo=
ns=20
though, I think they can carry the team with a lesser RB in the  backfield.=
?=20

WR Donald  Hayes (Car)? Apparently, the loss of Wesley Walls can be =20
overcome.? Hayes made some great plays Sunday.? Not unlike Keyshawn  Johnso=
n,=20
he only caught 3 passes, but he made the most of them with 58 yards and  a=
=20
TD.? He looks to be back on track.

WR Muhsin  Muhammad (Car)? I received a few emails asking how in the world =
=20
could I continue to rank Muhammad as high as I did last week.? He's good, =
=20
that's how.? Sure, the Rams had something to do with his play (and the =20
ranking) but I like his activity.? He caught 6 passes for 83 yards Sunday =
=20
night and should continue to play well.

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? I said a few weeks ago that Mason could be the bes=
t =20
WR on the team.? Now I'm sure of it.? Of course, it's a team that  doesn't=
=20
throw the ball very well and when they do throw, the TE is the primary =20
target.? Still though, he's a solid contributor and you could certainly do =
=20
worse at WR.? His special teams play is a nice bonus if your league let's =
=20
you "double dip" the WR and special teams categories.

WR  Laveranues Coles (NYJ)? Coles continues to play great  football.? He=20
ranks as the #26 WR over the last 3 games.? Keep an eye  on him for keeper=
=20
leagues as his play is very encouraging considering his lack  of experience=
.?=20
He should only get better.

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? I told you Robinson doesn't seem to care who's =
=20
throwing the ball and Robinson came through Sunday with 90 yards and a TD.?=
 =20
New QB Jim Miller definitely gave the Bears a spark and Robinson benefited=
=20
from  it.? Don't be surprised to see him keep it rolling.

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Shannon  Sharpe?(Bal)? Sharpe led the charge as the Ravens came  roaring=
=20
back.? He's clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet  QB Trent=
=20
Dilfer will continue feeding him the ball.

TE Ricky  Dudley (Oak)? Dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our =
=20
weekly cheatsheets.? Even though he made the downgrade list a couple of =20
times, we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on  potential=
.?=20
Dudley finally showed some of that potential Sunday with a  couple of TDs.?=
=20
It's worth noting that he scored 9 TDs in 1999.? 7 of  them came in the=20
second half of the season.

TE Jay  Reimersma? (Buf)? Reimersma seemed less rusty Sunday as he  hauled=
=20
down 6 receptions for 49 yards.? Flutie will probably get another  start th=
is=20
week and look for him to continue leaning on the big TE.

?

Players  Moving Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Donovan  McNabb?(Phi)? McNabb only completed 56% of his passes  Sunday.?=
=20
And even for the ones he completed, he only averaged 9.9 yards per =20
completion which is a bad sign.?? He doesn't seem to be?making  the=20
improvements and progression you'd like to see from a QB with his =20
experience.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? Batch was banged around repeatedly Sunday.? He =20
eventually left with a concussion and his status for this week will be =20
determined probably by Wednesday.? You've probably seen it by now, but  coa=
ch=20
Bobby Ross resigned.? I doubt that'll have too much effect on the  offense.

QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Bledsoe suffered a very Brett Favre like banged up =
=20
thumb as he hit a defender's helmet.? He was in obvious pain on the =20
sidelines and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play.? X - rays=
 =20
were negative but he's still hampered by it.? They'll make a decision on it=
 =20
this week but even if he can go, he could be limited.

QB Chris  Chandler (Atl)? Once again, Chandler was led off the field lookin=
g =20
punch drunk.? It wasn't pretty.? Danny Kannell actually played pretty  well=
=20
and could get the start this week.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? As expected, the dream became reality vs a tough =
=20
Baltimore defense.? I traded him in my league last week and hope you did  t=
he=20
same.? I'll say it again, a RB can only do so much when there is  absolutel=
y=20
no threat of the QB throwing the ball.? Akili Smith is world  class awful.?=
=20

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? As Warrick Dunn becomes a bigger part of the Buc =20
offense, Alstott is playing a reduced role.? Part of the reason is likely =
=20
his fumbling problems but the effectiveness of Dunn is playing a part I'm =
=20
sure.? That and Keyshawn said to give it to Dunn...

RB Kimble  Anders (KC)? The "featured" back in KC had 2 carries Sunday.? =
=20
Never ever trust a Kansas City RB.? No matter what I might tell you in the =
=20
future, don't believe it.? They'll break your heart every time.?=20

RB Travis  Prentice (Cle)? Prentice averaged 1.4 yards per carry  Sunday.?=
=20
That won't get it done. Like a lesser version of Corey Dillon,  beware RBs=
=20
with QBs who don't scare anyone throwing the ball.? Doug  Pederson doesn't=
=20
scare anyone...=20

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Johnnie  Morton (Det)? Morton's inability to take up the slack for the =
=20
departed Germane Crowell has been a huge disappointment.? He came up small =
=20
again Sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the future.

WR Herman  Moore (Det)? Let's put it this way:? JJ Stokes is the #4 WR  in=
=20
San Francisco and he had a better day than Moore...

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Like Alstott is suffering in the wake of Warrick =
=20
Dunn's success, Green is suffering as Keyshawn Johnson commands more =20
attention.? He only had 2 receptions and simply isn't getting the looks he =
=20
was earlier in the year.

WR Raghib  Ismail (Dal)? In what's become the uncomfortable norm, Dallas ha=
s =20
lost another WR to knee surgery.? There was so much promise this Summer  wi=
th=20
Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail.? Things  can=20
change quickly.

WR Carl  Pickens (Ten)? Pickens injured his hamstring again this  week.? I=
=20
was high on him coming over to the Titans but he's been a non  factor.?=20
Derrick Mason is the best WR on the team.? By a mile.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Chad  Lewis (Phi)? After a hot start, Lewis has struggled of late as =20
defenses bracket him.? With no WR to take some heat on the downfield  route=
s,=20
it's not too hard to shut down the TE.?? Until McNabb and  Charles Johnson?=
/=20
Torrance Small get going, his troubles will likely  continue.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? McGee should be a nice weapon for the struggling QB =
=20
Akili Smith but he doesn't seem to be utilizing him as you'd expect.? He =
=20
caught only 2 passes Sunday.? The sad part is that almost made him the =20
leading receiver.?=20

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

I never heard anything back from Walker's Westies so The Rounders are taking 
his spot.

Dear  Amazon Customer,  

Put  on your  dancing shoes and don your party hat. It's your  Amazon.com 
anniversary! That's right: a year ago you  placed your first order with us 
(using this account),  and we'd just like to say thanks. 

Since  your anniversary falls so close to the holidays, we  thought about 
e-mailing you a cup of eggnog. (In  the  dot-com world, we call it "e-Nog.") 
But the  tech folks  said that was impossible. So we opted  to share our 
favorite  customer-inspired holiday  services with you instead--including 
free  shipping.  May they make the season merry and  bright (and save you 
some money)! 


[IMAGE]
Create  a Wish List. Feeling  lucky? Then create a  Wish  List (or update an 
existing one) and fill  it with your favorite Amazon.com finds. You just  may 
win everything on your list--up to  $10,000.  
[IMAGE]
Meet  our Gift Wizard. Short on gift  ideas? Don't worry--we're big on 
solutions. Just  tell us a thing or two about the recipient, and  our   Gift 
Wizard will come up with a  wonderful  list of possibilities for you.  
[IMAGE]
Send  a Free Holiday e-Card. Christmas,  Hanukkah, Kwanzaa--no matter what 
you're celebrating,  an Amazon.com  e-Card is simply a fantastic way to  
spread  a little holiday  cheer.
[IMAGE]
Visit                     the Holiday Essentials Store.  Looking for 
wonderful  CDs, storybooks,  movies and decorations that'll  put you in  the 
spirit? Check out our Holiday  Essentials Store.

So  stop in and  discover the best the season has to offer--and be sure to 
shop before  December 10, 2000, to enjoy free  shipping on your order of $100 
or more (certain restrictions apply).  Thanks for helping make Amazon.com a 
great place to shop. 

Happy  anniversary,

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
"You Yankees never do read the Bible!" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, "The three wise men came from afar."

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. "Right now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see 
what (today) brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight "tweak" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. "I feel fine," Smith 
said, "I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now "optimistic" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. "If he's OK 
(today), he's starting," said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

 Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00 
 King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas.  He sat out a 
workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after 
taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys.   
King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to 
change against Dallas this week.  The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5  
passing yards per game this season.  But King is still one of the better QBs 
in the league.  He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good 
enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs.     

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him 
questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay.  The Cowboys, who have been 
devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who 
has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks. Fantasy 
owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James 
McKnight for the duration of the season.     

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be 
Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals. He has only 
thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing 
time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept 
him out of last week's game against the Giants. Fantasy owners should avoid 
Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs 
beginning for most leagues.     

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 
24.  "There's a chance he can come back," coach Jim Haslett said. "We're kind 
of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs."  Most Fantasy 
leagues will be over by Week 17.  But if your team is still playing having 
Williams will definitely help.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00 
 Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not 
healthy enough to take a gamble on.  "I'll definitely play this week," said 
Owens.  "It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate."   Owens' toe is 
purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed.  Don't expect him to put 
up good numbers this week.  Use another receiver instead of Owens if 
possible.     

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six 
passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win. He will start in place of his 
injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers 
against the Redskins. It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster 
this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably 
find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00 
 Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last 
Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented 
Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 
yards in the team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable 
matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer.    

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington.  
He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two 
weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius will replace 
Hilliard once again.    

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season.  He accounted for 82 
yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals. 
The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main 
offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive.  
Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting 
Barber in your starting lineup.    

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's 
win over Arizona.  Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as 
the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win.  
In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week 
shouldn't be much different. Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows 
it.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00 
 Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last 
week's win over Arizona.  He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing 
eleven touchdown passes in his last five games. He will face off against a 
tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth 
ranked pass defense. Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so 
you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it.     
 

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00 
 Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 
59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into 
overtime. The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland. Vanderjagt 
remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter 
your league's playoffs.      

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00 
 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns.  He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another.   

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 
 "The Edge" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five 
passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami. He faces the Jets this 
week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten. 
Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as 
always, will be the Colts' main man on offense.     

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 
 Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's loss to Miami. He will face the Jets this week in New York, which 
may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners. The Colts haven't faired well in 
the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay. Start 
Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's 
cold weather misfortunes.     

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00 
 Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three 
games.  The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler 
some time to heal his wounds.  It will also give them a chance to evaluate 
Johnson.  Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to 
avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason.  
Keep an eye on him though.  If he plays well he may be worth drafting next 
year.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 
 Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but 
the team decided not to let him play just before gametime. He is close to 
being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice 
first. "Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out 
and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it," said 
Coach Jeff Fisher. "I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against 
Philadelphia]." Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he 
hasn't had a reception since October 1.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against 
Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' 
receiving picture. As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, 
don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks. Check back 
with him next season.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of 
the battered Chris Chandler.  Don't expect Johnson to do too much better.  He 
should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the 
Falcons receivers don't get open enough.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00 
 The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their 
injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He has routinely been listed 
as probable for games this season, yet has played every game. More surprising 
is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of 
center Dermontti Dawson. Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring 
injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence 
to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis.  

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for 
Sunday's game against Oakland. He is expected to play, though, as he was also 
listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway. If he can't go, 
then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably 
get the call.  

 Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland 
with a broken foot. He is expected to run this week for the first time since 
he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week. 
Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, 
as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job.  

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play 
against the Cowboys Sunday.  He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used 
primarily as a blocker on the return team.    

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 
 Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is 
questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers.  If he is unable 
to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third 
receiver.  Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he 
might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league 
that allows more than two receivers.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Eric Bass Player News 

 Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00 
The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the 
Vikings. Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter? Or both? What will 
they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith? It may not matter too 
much if they double-team Moss. He has been known to make catches in double 
coverage but Carter is a different story. They focused their energies on 
stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, 
but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs. Thursday's game could be a 
long one for the Lions' defense. If you have them hope that they can find a 
way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team. 

 Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 
Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable 
on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. "Right 
now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see what (today) 
brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to 
use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the 
Fantasy playoffs beginning. 

 Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a "stress reaction on the 
mid-lower leg," which is a precursor of a stress fracture. He will have his 
leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, 
meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season. If you 
have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not 
worth holding onto him at this point. 

 Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the 
stretch. That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike 
Cloud. Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell 
Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins. 

 Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 
Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game 
against the Cowboys. With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin 
James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now. 
Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run 
defense this Thursday. 

 Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy 
owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' 
secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week 
Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your 
lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. 

 Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00 
Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin 
injury. Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game. As long as 
Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the 
Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00 
Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte 
Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete 
with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year. Nedney will be an unrestricted 
free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his 
kicking leg during the preseason. "It's not that I'm not enjoying my time 
here," said Nedney. "It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was 
brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, 
he'll be the guy." 

 Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards. He 
is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks. 
New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff 
Blake. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00 
Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 
2001, and why wouldn't he. He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading 
rusher, gaining 840 yards this season. Allen will be a restricted free agent 
after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like 
to bring him back next season. If Allen remains confident he will be a good 
Fantasy backup next season. Look for him to have a big game this week against 
a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over 
them Monday. 

 Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00 
Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics. He has been very 
inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of 
the season. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye.

As you all know, the flag football game was called off.     The current 
proposed structure is to give 8 tickets to Enron and 8 to AC.  The team which 
raises the most (by 5 pm, Monday 11-19) for each company will be awarded the 
tickets.  And the game will be rescheduled for sometime in the beginning of 
December.

I'm very disappointed with the way this whole situation has been mishandled.  
I can't speak as to what occurred on the Anderson side, but these are my 
thoughts on this situation.

1.  All the Enron captains (including the Aggies) agreed to play Saturday 
regardless of the weather.  I confirmed that we would be on as rain and cold 
weather were very likely to occur.  Had the other captains decided to not 
play in the cold rain, we could have rescheduled the game for  Sunday or an 
alternative day.

2.  My understanding is that the Aggies called the game  (Billy Lemmons and 
Ted Bland) and then changed the awarding of the tickets in way that directly 
benefitted the Aggie teams.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but neither Billy nor 
Ted were out at the field to judge the weather conditions prior to calling 
off the game.  Nor were the captains contacted for their input.   The rules 
have been abitrarily changed in mid-stream to the advantage of the Aggies and 
this is grossly unfair.   The top 2 fund raisers for the Enron Aggie teams 
were to be awarded footballs that were autograped by the Aggie football 
team.   Given this additional  incentive, it's not surprising that they 
raised more money than the UT teams  (by my unofficial estimates).  By one 
estimate who was familiar with the aggie fund rainsing efforts, one team 
raised about $2,000 and the other raised about $5,000. 

So what do we do about this situation?   It's up to you to decide if you want 
to play  in the rescheduled tournament.  Personally, I don't see much point 
nor motivation to play.  It surely won't be for bragging rights, as the real 
UT/a&m game will have already occurred.  In addition, I think it would be 
appropriate to give the people who donated funds the option to get their 
money back.   The situation that now exists is not what I raised money for.  

I want to thank you all for the work and effort you put forth for this event, 
it's unfortunate that it wasn't handled better.

I will be out all of next week.  Leave me a voicemail if you need to speak 
to  me.   I will have your shirts on the Monday following Thanksgiving.

I was thinking about taking Brenda to lunch on the 12th of Jan.  Let me know 
if you are interested in coming.  If that date does not work for you, we can 
go some other day.

If you are currently an analyst in a commercial rotation, then you are 
eligible for promotion to a third year analyst.  After you have completed 
your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial 
associate.  These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.  The conversation 
that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the 
Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these 
promotion guidelines going forward.

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and 
Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe 
Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a 
ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better 
way).  

Let me know

Subject: Risk Book Post ID's for EOL Reporting

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this.

News galore....let's jump into it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl) is doubtful with a concussion. He has not
practiced all week. QB Danny Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to sit another week with a sore
shoulder. Doug Flutie gets the start again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will not play this week.
Jim Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give
him the quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal) practiced with the first team Thursday and is
expected to start this week. If he cannot go because of his back,
Cliff Stoerner would start. Randall Cunningham is also hurt with a
sore knee and has not practiced.

QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to play through his ailments. This
week will be no different.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is
expected to start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to
team, Maybe try throwing for less than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not appear on the injury report, but
has a sore knee. He is expected to start this week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and did not practice
on Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play or not.
John Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could
also use Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a
situation you should avoid if at all possible.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played
through it the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not
start. The team named Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

to sit this week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out for another 2-3 weeks.

QB Shaun King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday.
He practiced on Thursday.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will likely be added today to the injury report
with a sore back. He expects to play on Sunday though.

players on the injury report. He will start on Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles and was held out of
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week, but
looks as if he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-
time decision which is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will

wrist.

practiced on Thursday.

report, but expects to start with his sore back and ribs. He
practiced on Thursday.

questionable this week. For those that have followed his career, this

TFL Report.? Our updated and  expanded Players in the News will be following 
right behind this  one.

Defensive Opportunities??  Duane Cahill from the Pittsburgh Tribune Review 
checks in with his  weekly look at defensive situations across the league 
that could create  opportunities for the offensive players across the line 
from them.
?
Once again this week, Zach Thomas finds himself on  the inactive list. 
Without him, the Miami D gave up 95 yards to Ahman Green last  Sunday.? James 
Stewart scored three times a couple of weeks back against  the Bucs tough D 
(without MLB Jamie Duncan), so there's no reason not to start  him, 
regardless of the matchup.

In the same game, keep an eye on Stephen  Boyd's status with the Lions.? He's 
missed most of the week's practices  with a bruised foot that was sore enough 
there was concern it was  fractured.? If he can't go, that opens things up 
for the 'Fins Lamar  Smith.

Keith Brooking joined Jessie Tuggle on the IR this week, meaning  that Mike 
Alstott will have huge holes up the middle of the Falcons' defense to  rumble 
through.? Look for big games from both him and Warrick  Dunn.

Bryce Paup and Orlando Thomas remain out of the Vikings lineup,  which bumps 
Brett Favre's stock up a few notches.? Shaun King had a field  day last week.

For the second straight week, Jerome Bettis is facing a  defensive line 
without key components.? Henry Ford is out, and Kenny Holmes  is nursing a 
very sore shoulder.? Holmes will have to tough it out since  backup Byron 
Frisch is inactive.? The bus should keep rollin'  on.

THE GLOVES ARE OFF:  JOHNSON ACCUSES FLUTIE OF INSTIGATING...

As reported by Mark Gaughan of the  Buffalo News, Rob Johnson may be  on the 
sidelines, but he's no longer silent about the Buffalo Bills'  brewing 
quarterback controversy. Johnson took exception to a column  in this week's 
Sports Illustrated that quoted two  unidentified Bills speaking about the 
team's quarterbacks. 

The story quoted one Bill as saying, "Rob  seems distracted by things, like 
wanting everyone to like him." It  quoted another as saying, "He'd rather get 
pummeled by four guys  than throw the ball away" in order to help his 
quarterback rating.  

Johnson, who did not make himself  available to local media this week, went 
on the Jim  Rome nationally syndicated radio show Friday and said he  thinks 
it was one player who made the comments. And he thinks that  one player was 
Doug Flutie. 

"I think everyone who reads the article  will pretty much know who it is," 
Johnson said. "I think it's the  same one that's pictured in the article." 

The only Bill pictured in the article is  Flutie. 

Johnson said he confronted the player  whom he suspected on Friday. 

"We talked about it today," Johnson said.  "He said he talked about the 
quarterback rating stuff, but he never  mentioned my name. Basically, that 
was it." 

Asked if he thought Flutie was a good  teammate, Johnson said: 

"I'm sure he's a good teammate for the  rest of the guys, and he's fine with 
them. Obviously, he's real  competitive. He's reaching the end of his career. 
He probably wants  to still play. I don't blame him for that. But if he was 
responsible  for these comments, I would not consider him a good teammate."  

Johnson said he did not see the team  being divided over the QB question. 

"I don't see it that way," he said. "I  don't know though. I mean, I haven't 
talked to all the players. But  I don't think many players in our locker room 
worry about  quarterback rating or even worry about what our quarterback 
ratings  are. It's absurd to think players worry about that or even  
quarterbacks worry about that when they are playing in a football  game." 

However, he said he didn't like  unattributed comments from teammates. 

"For someone to go anonymously and say  those things is kind of, I don't 
know, cowardly," he said. "It's not  typical of football players... If a lot 
of guys feel that way, they  should come to me and say it to my face," he 
said. "I'm a man.  They're men, and I can take it. I'd rather hear about it 
from them  than hear about it on the radio when I'm driving home, from an FM  
channel when I'm trying to listen to Limp Biskit." 

Regarding the desire to be liked by his  teammates, Johnson said: 

"I'm 27 years old. Most of guys on our  team are pretty young and we have a 
lot in common. We hang out. I  don't go out of my way to make friends or kiss 
anyone's butt.  Everywhere I've been on teams, I've had a good relationship 
with the  guys on the team and I have a lot in common with them." 

Asked if he got the sense he was  competing against Joe Montana for the QB 
job,  Johnson replied, "I wish it was Joe Montana, because at least he won  
some Super Bowls and won MVPs in the league. I wish that was the  case. I 
think that would be an easier situation." 

Regarding his injured shoulder, Johnson  said it is not 100 percent. 

"It tightened up on me pretty good  today," he said. "I haven't been able to 
get my arm pretty much all  the way over the top or raise it all the way 
above my head to throw  the ball. I've kind of been side-arming things just 
trying to get  through practice so I could be the backup. I don't know what 
they  are going to do. I want to back up, but that might not be in the  best 
interest in the team (this week)." 

Head coach Wade Phillips  said Friday he would wait until pregame warm-ups 
Sunday to decide  whether Johnson would be number-two or number-three against 
New  England. 

Although Phillips wasn't willing to  address the escalating tension between 
Johnson and Flutie, Buffalo  general manager John Butler, speaking on the  
Empire Sports Network, said he doesn't fear the  team is in turmoil. 

"I was at practice today and it looked  like a football team preparing for 
the New England Patriots," he  said. "I'll tell you, if you've been around 
sports, been in locker  rooms, if you get 53 men together, not everybody is 
going to like  everybody all the time. The key is to be respectful of one 
another  and when it comes time to play, you play hard and play together.  

"Everybody isn't going to be walking hand  in hand down the hallways, but 
we've got a team that's going to  stick together and play their hearts out 
and that's all that  matters. 

"These are grown men. Sometimes it's fun  to even blow it up a little bit 
more than it is, and so be it. It's  incumbent upon our team to stick 
together and they will," he said.  "I've been through this 150 times." 

Butler dismissed the SI quotes because  they had no attribution. 

"If you want to say something and can't  put your name to it, it bothers me," 
he said. "You've got a problem  somewhere so I don't put any substance to 
it." 

Stay tuned boys and girls... We haven't  heard the last of this one...

REDMOND INJURES FOOT;  PATS LIKELY TO RELY ON FAULK...

According to Frank Dell'Apa of the  Boston Globe, it looks like Kevin  Faulk 
will be asked to carry running game when the New  England Patriots take on 
the Buffalo Bills tomorrow. 

Faulk's opportunity comes at the expense  of rookie J.R. Redmond, who 
displaced Faulk in the  starting lineup with a 22-carry, 97-yard performance 
against the  Colts two weeks ago, but was downgraded to questionable on 
Friday's  injury report after hurting his foot in practice Thursday. 

According to head coach Bill  Belichick, Redmond "stepped on something at 
practice and  wasn't able to do much (Friday)." 

"I don't know if I'll be playing more,"  Faulk said. "Whatever the game plan 
is, I'm ready every week."  

Faulk will be facing a difficult test  this time. Buffalo has surrendered 585 
rushing yards, the  second-lowest total in the NFL. 

"All you have to do is check the stats,"  Faulk said. "Teams don't average 
more than 3 yards a carry against  them." 

The Patriots are averaging 3.4 yards per  rush and Faulk is averaging 3.7 
yards per rush. 

"It's always a challenge, but this time  it's even more of a challenge 
because we are going against one of  the best defenses in the league," Faulk 
said. "We can't expect to  run over them, no. What we need is a balanced 
attack. If we can get  that going and move the football, we should be all 
right." 

Faulk was on pace to gain more than 1,000  yards after four games but he has 
tailed off with a total of 171  yards in the last four games. 

But Faulk is the team's leading  all-purpose yardage player with 1,156 yards, 
an average of 7 yards  each time he has the ball. 

Team officials had hoped the Redmond's  ascension to the first team would 
allow Faulk to concentrate on what  most observers feel he is best suited 
for: third-down duty. 

As productive as he might have been the  first half of the season, concerns 
over Faulk's durability have been  an issue from day one and Belichick is 
convinced the former LSU  standout's ability to run the ball effectively is 
inversely  proportional to the number of time he carries it... 

Other items of interest... 

After working extensively at wide  receiver this week, tight end Eric 
Bjornson was  included on the team's list of early inactives yesterday. And 
his  chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks don't sound  very 
good after team officials indicated that Rod Rutledge will  start at tight 
end for the remainder of the season... 

Wide receiver Terry  Glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice, but  
he's listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as  usual 
against the Bills tomorrow. 

Quarterback Drew Bledsoe  missed Thursday's practice in order to stay with 
his wife as she  gave birth to the couple's third child. The veteran signal 
caller  will start and play as usual tomorrow.

REDSKINS' JOHNSON HAS  SIGNIFICANT MCL TEAR...

Mark Maske of the Washington  Post reported this morning that Redskins 
quarterback  Brad Johnson is suffering from a significant tear  to the medial 
collateral ligament in his left knee that is  relatively close to being a 
complete tear. 

Maske went on to write, "even when his  MCL heals sufficiently for him to 
resume playing, Johnson will face  the risk of suffering a more severe knee 
injury by playing on the  damaged joint. He will have to decide how much risk 
to take playing  for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason, 
at a  time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed  
income beyond this season. 

"As he exited Redskins Park yesterday,  Johnson acknowledged the increased 
risks but said he plans to play  again this season and will make his 
decisions based solely upon his  physical readiness to play, not upon future 
financial  considerations. He said the timetable for his return is unclear, 
but  he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the St. Louis  
game." 

Team officials expect Johnson to miss  that November 20 meeting with the 
Rams. Of course, the former Viking  has already been ruled out for tomorrow's 
game against Arizona and  Jeff George will make his first appearance with  
Washington's first team offense this season. 

Maske cited a source close to the  situation as saying, coaches hope Johnson 
will return in time for  the team's November 26 meeting with Philadelphia at 
FedEx Field.  

Johnson told Maske yesterday that he has  every intention of playing again 
this season. 

"There's no doubt about that (he will  play again this season). I think it's 
a matter of when. The weeks  kind of go by fast. But we're still dealing with 
seven more games, a  bye week and the playoffs. Right now our team just has 
to find a way  to win, and I've got to find a way to get healthy. In time, 
then  we'll get back together." 

Johnson said he would like to be ready to  play against the Rams, the 
defending Super Bowl champions. The  Redskins have 15 days between games 
because they have a bye the  weekend after Sunday's Arizona game. 

"We probably won't make a decision about  the St. Louis game until the 
Wednesday or Thursday before the game,"  Johnson said. "I would like to play. 
I think that would be a great  game to be part of. The biggest decision isn't 
whether it's  (artificial) turf or grass. It's just being able to drop back 
and  being healthy enough to play a full game." 

However, Maske's sources indicate the  Redskins are already planning for 
George to start against St. Louis  a week from this coming Monday. 

Team officials have described Johnson's  injury as a Grade 2 MCL sprain, but 
Maske's sources say the injury  is at the severe end of the Grade 2 range and 
actually borders on  being a Grade 3 sprain. 

A Grade 2 injury is defined as one in  which the tissue has been partially 
but not completely torn and  there is appreciable limitation in function. A 
Grade 3 injury is one  in which tissue has been significantly or completely 
torn or  disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function.  

NFL players regularly play with MCL  injuries. The risk players take by 
playing on damaged knees is that  they will suffer more severe knee injuries. 
Johnson said he knows  the risks but will play when he is able. 

"The biggest thing is, right now the  ligament is weak," he said. "Obviously 
right now... It could worsen  very easily if I took a hit. There hasn't been 
a whole lot of  discussion about that. The biggest discussion now is how 
we're going  to treat it and get back as soon as possible. When I'm healthy  
enough to drop back and play, then I'll play that day." 

Johnson says the fact he intends to test  the free agent market after the 
season won't be a factor in  determining when he plays again. 

"The most important thing for me is to be  able to drop back in the pocket," 
Johnson said. "From that point on,  if I can drop back in the pocket, then 
I'll play. I'm not worried  about ever taking a hit. I've gone through 
injuries before. The  biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play. 
I'm not worried  about a contract next year with anyone. I feel like my play 
overall,  and my history, will take care of itself." 

Johnson was on the practice field  yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped. 
He moved little, made some  throws and mostly watched George and rookie 
quarterback Todd  Husak -- who has been elevated from third to second on the  
Redskins' depth chart -- at work. 

"I feel much better than I did Tuesday or  Wednesday," Johnson said. "I can 
throw normal. There's no problem  there. I can do a lot of walking. I ride 
the (exercise) bike about  an hour a day. The problem is going lateral, side 
to side. As a  quarterback, that's what you do in the pocket. So I'm not able 
to  drop back at full speed and throw. But I'm better than I was earlier  in 
the week." 

Other notes of interest out of Washington  this morning... 

Veteran fullback Larry  Centers comes off a productive game last Monday 
night,  catching six passes for 39 yards and a touchdown. Given the  
Redskins' injury problems at wide out, Centers could get a number of  looks 
out of the backfield this week against his old team, the  Cardinals. 

Although Albert Connell,  Irving Fryar and James Thrash are  all expected to 
play, the chances of any of them going full speed  are slim. 

Look for cornerback Champ  Bailey will see his most extensive playing time of 
the  season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat  to 
keep the Cards from focusing their all of their attention RB  Stephen Davis. 

Davis had 280 yards on 55 attempts in his  two games against the Cardinals in 
1999 and in what will be a  scaled-back game plan, he's likely to get 25-30 
carries against the  Cardinals' marshmallow-soft defensive front seven.

BRONCOS KNOW DAVIS IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR  SUCCESS...

This is it... It's time for Denver Broncos running back  Terrell Davis to 
make his second comeback of the  season against the Jets tomorrow. Unlike the 
season opener when all  eyes were on the veteran's surgically reconstructed 
right knee, this  time everybody will be watching Davis' badly sprained left 
foot and  ankle that get all the attention. 

The former University of Georgia star has  missed five of the last seven 
games -- including three in a row --  and has gained only 99 total yards on 
24 carries... 

Don't look for coaches to push Davis  incredibly hard in his first game back. 
In fact, Davis isn't sure  how much he might be capable of doing this week. 

"Let me just finish this game. If I can  finish this game I'll be the 
happiest man on this planet," Davis  said. "If I can stay healthy, I know 
good things are going to  happen..." 

And make no mistake about it: Keeping  Davis healthy becomes job number-one 
from here on out. Coaches are  certainly aware than whatever chances the team 
might have of making  a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive 
Davis in the  mix. 

So the goal this week will be easing him  back into playing shape by giving 
him maybe 15 carries tomorrow with  Mike Anderson taking the rest... 

One factor working in Davis' favor  Howard Griffith's return to the lineup 
after  experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last  
two weeks. The veteran fullback said it's all part of the process,  however, 
and has practiced full speed all week. 

"It's getting there. It's not going to be  100 percent until I'm not banging 
people anymore," he said...  

Bottom line on Davis? 

My expectations are high for him over the  remainder of the season, but I'm 
not sure I'd want to bank on a huge  game in his first week back... 

One last note out of Denver this  morning... Backup running back KaRon 
Coleman was  included on Friday's list of early inactives due to a sprained  
foot.

A RELIEVED JEFF GEORGE  READY TO FACE CARDINALS...

According to the Associated Press,  veteran quarterback Jeff George looked 
relieved and  relaxed after practice Friday. It was easier to concentrate on 
his  upcoming first start with the Washington Redskins knowing that his  
newborn baby was doing fine. 

"Thank God," George said. "I think  whenever something goes wrong and it's 
your own, you worry. First  things first. My family's number-one in my life, 
and I got to take  care of them." 

George is starting Sunday's game at  Arizona because Brad Johnson sprained a 
knee  ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. But instead of  preparing 
full-tilt for his first action of the season, George  missed practice 
Wednesday when his wife delivered their third child.  

The next day, George was distracted by  news that the baby, Jayden Scott, had 
breathing  difficulties. It was only just before Thursday afternoon's 
practice  that he received word that the baby was fine. 

George, who earlier this season answered  "dad" when asked to give one word 
to describe himself, was confident  he could overcome the distractions and 
give a good performance  Sunday. 

"When you get some sort of news like we  did," George said, "you take a back 
seat and say, `What's more  important?' But I've prepared myself. It hasn't 
been just this week,  I've been preparing the last 10 weeks. It's not a cram 
session. I've  been preparing from the get-go." 

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million  contract in April to back up 
Johnson so he could have a shot at  playing for a Super Bowl team. He said he 
doesn't see Sunday's game  as an audition either to replace Johnson or to 
build interest in  other teams considering an off-season trade. 

"I think everybody knows what I can do,"  George said. "We've got an injury, 
and I've got to carry the torch.  You hate to have to play under these 
circumstances. Brad's my  friend. I wish him well. I hope he recovers fast." 

Johnson, who could miss two to four weeks  with the injury, is one of many 
ailing Redskins starters, including  wide receivers Irving Fryar and Albert  
Connell, who are likely to be less than full speed for  Sunday's game. 

"I probably feel the healthiest out of  anybody," George said. 

Coaches might have Skip  Hicks handle kickoff returns against the Cardinals 
this  Sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for James  Thrash, who has 
been returning kickoffs and punts, starting  at wide receiver -- and -- 
playing on kickoff and punt coverage  teams...

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with "new" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact, Telluri=
de=20
has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the temperatur=
es=20
have been frigid=01(which makes for excellent snowmaking conditions. Winter=
 has=20
come, and you know what that means =01( YES! Time to strap on some boards a=
nd=20
make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=
he=20
local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=
he=20
window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20
waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=
=20
other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20
anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=
=20
check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT=
=20
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And=
=20
that=01,s what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.=
=20
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some o=
f=20
America=01,s biggest hubs:

Dallas Special:  $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and=20
roundtrip air to Montrose
Houston Special: $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and=20
roundtrip air to Montrose
Chicago Special: $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and=20
roundtrip air to Montrose
Miami Special:  $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and=20
roundtrip air to Montrose

To get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging=
=20
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT=01,S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=
rt=20
installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=
ft=20
pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=
,=20
5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from=20
beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be =01&tasty.=018

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=
=20
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20
Sophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=
=20
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenin=
gs=20
year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner=20
reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=
ore.=20
You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American=20
Airlines=01*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body i=
s in=20
one of them!


WHAT=01,S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22=
,=20
the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=
=20
the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=
=20
ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=
rd=20
Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21=20
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program. Wh=
at=01,
s it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at participati=
ng=20
lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lif=
t=20
ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for=
=20
each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360.

And if you=01,re looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at t=
he=20
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboar=
d=20
Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center.=20
Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was th=
e=20
case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=
=20
fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to=
=20
dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter=01,s absolute embarrassment!) How=
ever,=20
the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever=
.=20
The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no=
=20
less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That=01,s all for this letter. Hope you=01,re planning your trip to Telluri=
de,=20
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on=
=20
the slopes!

Rosemerry


WHO=01,S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?
Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six=
=20
years ago. But after a few turns, she fell =01( in love with the sport. She=
=20
lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7=01*an ideal spot for=
=20
getting first chair of the morning.

Quarterbacks in the  News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is  still hurting a 
tad with thumb and rib injuries.? He is listed as probable  on the injury 
report.? His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a  shoulder injury.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jake Plummer  (Ari) looks to start with the sore ribs 
but understand that one good  shot could send him out of the game a la 
Charlie Batch Thursday night.? Be  careful here.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the  season.
 

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making  excellent progress, but he will likely miss 
again this week.? Shane  Matthews is expected to get the start this week.? 
Cade is listed as  questionable with a sore shoulder.? He would probably play 
if Matthews were  to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter  despite a sore 
knee.? He practiced on Wednesday.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Scott Mitchell  (Cin)?looked good again in practice 
Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the start which is good news 
for his  teammates.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses  his ribs.? 
The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will  look to 
Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.? Either way,  look for 
Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.
?
*** Saturday Update? Cleveland QBs.? Coach Chris  Palmer will reportedly wait 
until gametime to decide between QBs Doug Pederson  and Spergon Wynn.? What a 
choice.? I'm fairly confident you're not  starting either if you're with me 
still in week 14...

QB Clint Stoerner  was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return  the last week of the NFL season at 
the earliest.? Gus Frerotte will start  in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and  is expected to take 
the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC)  practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable 
whether he will start.?  The coaching staff has yet to name a starter.? I 
rate his chances at 85% to  start.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Elvis Grbac (KC) has been  named the starter.? He 
says the finger feels fine and he's good to  go.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks  like he 
will start this Sunday.? He is listed as questionable on the injury  report 
with a sore shoulder and neck.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jay Fielder (Mia) has looked good  (or at least as 
good as he ever looks) in practice and looks to start  Sunday.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.? He  appears as 
questionable on the injury report again with a? sore thumb and a  bruised 
ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that 
to keep him  off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or  two for a more 
durable body.? He appears on the injured list again as  questionable with a 
sore knee.? Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,? will  start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for  the injured Brock Huard.? 
Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney  and was just released from 
the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner  (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice.? 
He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.? 
He is listed as questionable on  the injury report with a hurt thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind  center while Jeff George watches.? I 
doubt we have seen the last of this  controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running  backs in the News:
*** Saturday Update? RB Thomas Jones (Ari) has been  deactivated for this 
week's game as he's still recovering from  pneumonia.??? More work for 
Michael Pittman.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  practice briefly on Wednesday and is 
questionable for this week's game.? He  is having troublemaking the hard cuts 
so will likely be ineffective even if he  plays.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Sammy Morris (Buf) isn't looking  much better as we 
near kickoff.? I'm not expecting much of anything from  him this week.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB  Tshimanga?Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He 
is  listed as probable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a  setback this week 
and has been deactivated for Sunday's game.? Look for RB  Brad Hoover to get 
another start.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in practice Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is good news for his  teammates.
*** Saturday Update FB Nick Williams (Cin) ?likely  starts for Clif Groce 
Sunday.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.? Look for  Travis 
Prentice to "shoulder" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith  (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start this week.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.? Mike Anderson 
gets the  start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his  sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.? Ahman  Green will get the 
start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and  is expected to be the 
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury  report with a 
tender hamstring.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Lamar Smith (Mia) continues to look  good in practice 
and should be good to go.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is  probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as  questionable on the injury report with bruised 
ribs, but he expects to  play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.? He  may now be 
ready for the last game of the regular season.? His cast is  expected to come 
off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore neck.? He is still expected  to start though, but Chad Morton may see a 
few more reps than usual.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Jerald Moore (NO) was upgraded to  probably after a 
good practice Thursday and looks to start.

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.? He is listed as 
probable  with a sore gluteus.? I am guessing he is the butt of many New 
York  jokes.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) apparently is  better with a week 
to heal and should be able to make a bigger contribution this  week.? 

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will  return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and  finger, but his 
ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring 
Thursday and is?was listed as questionable.? He  did do some work Saturday 
and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this  week and he is using the time to 
look for personalized items with his last  name.? We will keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.? On a 
team that already has a crowded  backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell 
Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could  be placed on the inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a  broken rib, but is expected to play with the 
pain.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) practiced  again Friday and 
looks to start Sunday.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed  as questionable on the injury report, but 
is doubtful he would have played  anyway.? The team remains cautious in his 
comeback.

RB Mike Alstott  (TB) will not play this week.? Look for Warrick Dunn to get 
plenty of  opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten)  skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects to practice 
today and play this  weekend.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten) looked good in  practice Friday and 
will start.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his  sore forearm.? Look for the Giants 
to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.  
*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.? 

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in  the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore  leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to  play with 
a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this  week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he  injured 
in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play  with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore  groin.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Donald Hayes (Car)?was able to  practice Friday and is 
still looking like a go for Sunday.? Watch for the  snow however.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was  released from the hospital 
after spending a few days keeping an eye on his  back.? He's been downgraded 
to doubtful and I'm really not looking for  anything from this weekend.? He'd 
been struggling with QB Shane Matthews  anyway.? I'd look elsewhere if you 
can.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Marty Booker (Chi) looks to see  more playing time 
with Robinson's back troubles.?
?
*** Saturday Update?WR Peter Warrick  (Cin)?? QB Scott Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in  practice Friday and is now probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is  good news for his teammates.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.? He 
did not practice on Wednesday.

WR  Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.? Johnnie Morton and Herman  
Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more  time on the injury report than Yancey 
Thigpen...well maybe not, but he can't  stay healthy either.? Corey misses 
another game this week as he is  officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and  is listed as questionable on 
the injury report.? He says he will be ready  to play though.
?
*** Saturday Update WR E.G. Green (Ind) did not improve  this week and has 
been deactivated.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable  with a sore toe.? With Tony Martin now 
healthy, the team will likely rest  OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore leg, but he expects to play.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Troy Brown (NE) ?was able to  do some work Saturday 
but still isn't 100%.? He'll probably be the # 3 WR  if he can go Monday.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than  his listing on the injury 
report.? Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing  good enough to hold onto 
the starting jobs even if Jake were to get  healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.? Joe  Jurevicius will 
start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start  over Laveranues Coles who is out with a 
twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins  (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but 
even if he played he would  likely be ineffective.? Hines Ward has been the 
only Pittsburgh receiver to  do anything consistently all year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to  play, but he keeps talking like he 
will be on the field though.? He was  quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying 
he is 85% right now.? I am guessing  he is closer to 70%, but he probably 
will play if he can handle the pain from  his turf toe.
*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice  again Friday and 
looks like he'll be the # 3 WR behind Jerry Rice and J.J.  Stokes.? It's 
tough not to start him as he's always got the potential to  explode but he's 
a big risk.? If you need sure points this week, I'd shy  away from him.? If 
you really need help and you're looking for a home run,  you might take a 
chance on him but just be prepared for the chance he does  little.
?
*** Saturday Update? St. Louis WRs?will likely  be playing on a less than 
optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking at 
possible snow.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR  Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.? Even 
if  he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert  Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his 
condition.? He  remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to 
whether he plays.?  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he 
may have limited value  even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh,  but is expected to play this 
week.?  

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the  News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is  expected to play with a 
sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) looked good in  practice later this 
week and will likely get the start.

TE Shannon Sharpe  (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore  knee.? Fantasy players are 
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player  in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore  quadriceps.? He was 
limited in practice, but expects to play in the  game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this  weekend.? He 
is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as  questionable on the 
injury report with a sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Jackie Harris (Dal) did practice  and looks good for 
Sunday.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and  just did not catch a pass last 
week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.? If  Grbac plays, expect him to get 
the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin  (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. 

TE Johnny  McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.? John Davis still gets a lot 
of looks  though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.  

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.? But  he has looked 
like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes  before 
game-time.? Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the  players 
to start working through the pain.? I rate Wilkins chance to start  at close 
to 90% this week.

=09?? Marge Ringer=20
=09
=09BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on=
=20
Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a=
=20
"need-to-win" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is =
no=20
plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the=
=20
offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive=
=20
coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20
rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20
promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R=
oy=20
Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad=
e=20
these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take=

more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock=
=20
Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see=
=20
more carries than the two he had against OU last week.=20

=09Kenny Hayter=20
=09
=09Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b=
igger=20
running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20
third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow=
n=20
back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a=
=20
guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on=
=20
first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20
well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20
long  situations due to not
=09
=09picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,=
 is a=20
more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther=
e=20
on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20
Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an=
d=20
is a reliable blocker. =20
=09?? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20
=09
=09BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game=
=20
became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th=
e=20
second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h=
e=20
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw=
=20
and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi=
s=20
week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20
=09?? Lance Kyles=20
=09
=09BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed =
to=20
bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne=
xt=20
year's OU game.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get=
=20
pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?=
=20
Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?=
=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=
g=20
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa=
s=20
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot =
of=20
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=
e=20
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=
=20
week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=
,=20
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=
rs=20
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20
defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like=
=20
running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi=

yards.=20

at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for=

the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20
embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are=
=20
about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20
=09?? Lisa Davis, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around=
=20
Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20
coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond=
=20
after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi=
s=20
game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,=
=20
the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart =
in=20
order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real=
ly=20
in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20
chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta=
te=20
and at Texas A=02?are slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge wi=
th at=20
least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with =
a=20
win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhi=
te=20
at QB, then everyone will say "I told you so, Mack" regarding the QB rotati=
on=20
having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also=
=20
embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but=
=20
they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for=

the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.=

idea =20
what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that =
=20
after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numero=

times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistenc=
y,=20
and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to=

embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to scr=
ew=20
up horribly in random=20
=09
=09games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like=
 the=20
players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the=
=20
solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend i=
n=20
a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient=
=20
Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't=
=20
work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffl=
e=20
me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to=
=20
fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developi=
ng=20
a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then=

the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the go=
od=20
but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.=
=20
=09?? David Rowe, Austin=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma =
got=20
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t=
o=20
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc=
he=20
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=
.=20
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=
=20
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=
he=20
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=
o=20
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=
ut=20
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=
er=20
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=
=20
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=
=20
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=
an=20
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=
=20
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =
have=20
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=
=20
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=
=20
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=
me=20
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=
=20
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=
ke=20
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=
=20
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=
he=20
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=
=20
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20
tendencies also?=20
=09?? Todd Purl=20
=09
=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =
his=20
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=
as=20
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=
t=20
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=
=20
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=
=20
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=
ng=20
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=
e=20
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=
=20
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=
=20
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- =
be=20
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
=20
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
=20
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
nd=20
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
Or=20
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
=20
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
=09?? Mike Engelman=20
=09
=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
ing.=20
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
er=20
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
=20
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
exas=20
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
=20
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
=20
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
ng=20
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
e=20
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
e=20
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
e=20
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
=20
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
=20
had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
had=20
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
on=20
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
=20
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
e=20
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
=20
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
ke=20

=09
=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20

=20
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
=20
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
=20
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses=20
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
.=20
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
=09
=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
e=20
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
n=20
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
e=20
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
e=20
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=

this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
s=20
on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
=09?? Lane=20
=09
=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
t=20
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
,=20
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20

anymore.=20

Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=

the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =

did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=

when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=

=09
=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The=

one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
se=20
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=

he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=

=09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=

up=20
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=

=20
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=

don't know. What do you think?=20
=09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20

=20
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=
=20
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=
om=20
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=
0=20
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=

corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=

  Crash and burn
Louisville courtship of Rockets in jeopardy

June 13, 2000 1:42 p.m. ET

Associated Press

HOUSTON =01* The bid by Louisville, Ky., to land the Houston Rockets appear=
s to=20
have fallen through.
Jefferson County in Kentucky on Monday declined to join a three-pronged=20
proposal that would publicly finance a downtown basketball arena.

The plan suggested the city, county and state each issue up to $30 million =
in=20
bonds to cover a portion of an arena that could cost $220 million.

The arena would be built to attract the Rockets or another professional=20
basketball team.

Team officials visited with Louisville business and government leaders last=
=20
month. The Rockets have also been in negotiations with Baltimore, New Orlea=
ns=20
and St. Louis, but Louisville was the only city to publicly court the team.

City officials wanted to submit a proposal to the Rockets by Tuesday, but t=
he=20
county indicated it wasn't ready to participate in the plan, the Houston=20
Chronicle reported Tuesday.

"Please do not issue any statements of commitment, or send a memorandum of=
=20
understanding at this time on behalf of the county," Jefferson County=20
Judge/Executive Rebecca Jackson wrote in a letter that was delivered to=20
Louisville Mayor David Armstrong.

The letter, dated Monday, was also signed by the county's three commissione=
rs.

The Rockets declined comment on the development, but denied ever giving=20
Louisville attorney J. Bruce Miller a deadline to submit a proposal.

Meanwhile Monday, about 35 protesters chanted "don't pick our pockets to pa=
y=20
for the Rockets!" in front of the county courthouse in Louisville to protes=
t=20
spending public money on an arena.

The Rockets have been considering a move since November, when voters in=20
Houston rejected a plan to build them a $160 million arena.

Confirming what we thought this morning when we ranked Jeff George and not
Brad Johnson on our week 10 cheatsheet
http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm

Brad Johnson Out, Jeff George to Start
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1101/851321.html    From the article:  Jeff
George was named the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for Sunday's
game at Arizona.

Coach Norv Turner said George would start after Brad Johnson was unable to
practice Thursday for a second consecutive day. Johnson sprained a knee
ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. George missed Wednesday's
practice to attend the birth of his son, his third child.

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million contract in April to back up
Johnson. He has yet to play a down this season and has taken only about 10
percent of the snaps in practice.

"He had a very good practice today," Turner said. "He's into it, in terms of
what we're doing."  The Redskins have a bye after the Arizona game, but
officials are uncertain whether Johnson will be able to return for the
following game, a Monday night trip to St. Louis.

"He's got a pretty tender knee," trainer Bubba Tyer said. "Grade 2 sprains
could be two weeks, could be four weeks."  Further complicating the
Redskins' offensive preparation for this week, three receivers are suffering
from injuries, with Irving Fryar the most serious. Fryar, who missed
practice Wednesday because of a rib-cartilage injury, returned Thursday but
is questionable for Sunday.

Albert Connell practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable. And
James Thrash also practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is probable.


My View:  I'm sure Jeff George isn't available in your league but if he's on
your roster, now might be the time to consider him.  I'm not overly excited
though as Arizona has a pretty tough pass defense.  Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 5 in passing yards allowed per game.  For the season,
they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing QB so they're not
quite as tough there.   This could likely be an audition for 2001 as many
feel George is the Redskin QB of the future.  A strong performance could
easily cause problems for the remainder of this year as Washington tries to
sort out the QB position.  WRs Albert Connell and James Thrash are both
listed as probable and should be good to go. At this point in the year,
nobody is 100%.  RB Larry Centers does such a nice job catching the ball out
of the backfield that TE Stephen Alexander has been ineffective.

Grab Gus Frerotte!
?
As a followup to our followup today on Griese,  ESPN's John Clayton has 
more.? He's reporting that backup QB Gus Frerrotte  has been told he needs to 
be ready to play for the rest of the season.?  
?
Don't panic yet as it'll be a couple of days still  before they know exactly 
what they're dealing with. But the bottom line is this  seems to be getting 
worse by the minute.
?
I'm not a?huge Frerotte fan but if he winds up  starting, he'll be handed the 
keys to one of the more prolific offenses in the  league.? Between Mike 
Shanahan and Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubiak,  that's a great brain trust.? 
A healthy Terrell Davis, 2 great WRs and 3 TEs  that are all effective make 
for a nice system.
?
We'll stay on this for you.

Here's the full article from ESPN's Clayton for  more detail.?

While not issuing an update on the injury Tuesday,  the Denver Broncos were 
fearful enough of losing quarterback Brian Griese because of his separated  
throwing shoulder that they told backup Gus Frerotte to be ready to play the  
rest of the season, ESPN.com's John Clayton reported.
?
Griese's injury is officially listed as a separated  AC joint. The Broncos 
said Tuesday they aren't likely to know about their  quarterback's 
availability for Sunday's game against San Diego until later in  the week. 

Griese was injured in the first quarter of  Denver's 27-24 win over Oakland 
on Monday night, but he returned to the lineup  and helped engineer the 
victory. 

"We won't know for a couple of days the exact  extent of the injury," coach 
Mike Shanahan said. "We'll wait to see how sore he  is." 

Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said Griese could be out  a "significant period of 
time," adding, "It looks bad." 

Asked after the game if he expected to play  against the Chargers, Griese 
said, "I don't know. I can't tell you what's going  to happen, what my 
availability will be for next week. I've never had an injury  like this, but 
I'm going to do my best to come back and play." 

Griese already was playing with torn cartilage in  the same shoulder, which 
will require off-season surgery. He insisted the two  injuries are unrelated.

Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. "The end
zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous". "They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the
outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many
times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. "All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our
prediction."

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Lee Nailon , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Hornets activated Nailon from the injured list today after placing Otis 
Thorpe on the injured list. Nailon has been out since the start of the season 
with right ankle tendinitis.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Thorpe was placed on the injured list by the Hornets today with a strained 
left foot. He had played in six of Charlotte's eight games this season, 
posting a 3.0 ppg average and a season-best eight points against New Jersey 
on November 4.  

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Dudley left Thursday's game with a sprained left ankle 3 1/2 minutes into 
the contest and did not return.  He could be sidelined for up to three 
weeks.  Daniel Santiago will probably start at center in his absence.     

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/16/00 
 Webber did not practice Wednesday due to a sprained left ankle, and is 
doubtful for Thursday's game.  He did not play in the Kings' win over the 
Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.  Scott Pollard will start at power forward if 
Webber is unable to play.      

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 LaFrentz is suffering from a contusion on his left hand and is questionable 
for Thursday's game against Chicago. If LaFrentz can't play Keon Clark will 
start at center. LaFrentz has been inconsistent this year averaging 10.3 
points and 6.6 rebounds per game but is still one of the better Fantasy 
centers.    

 Eduardo Najera , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Najera has had a diminished role with the Mavericks since starting at small 
forward in the season opener.  Dallas has sinced moved Greg Buckner into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard and placed Michael Finley at small forward 
in Najera's place.  Najera played a season-low 10 minutes against the Suns 
Wednesday.  He may be re-inserted into the starting lineup to shake things 
up.  Dallas has lost three out of its last five games.    

 Michael Finley , F DAL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/16/00 
 Finley's shooting woes continued against Phoenix Wednesday.  He scored seven 
points and shot 3-for-16 from the field.  In the past four games, Finley has 
made just 33 percent of his shots.  His current slump could be attributed to 
the fact that he played small forward in those games.  He played well against 
San Antonio, matching up with the 6-7 Sean Elliott but struggled to get his 
shot off against taller more athletic small forwards in the next three games 
against Peja Stojakovic, Lamar Odom, and Shawn Marion.  It may be wise to 
stay away from Finley until he regains his shooting touch or moves back to 
shooting guard.        

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Miles did not play in Wednesday's game against the Knicks.  Head coach Alvin 
Gentry chose to go with a more experienced lineup and started Tyrone Nesby at 
shooting guard.  Keep and eye on this situation.  This could lead to a 
diminished role for Miles.    

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 During the offseason he was touted as a potential savior for the Suns at the 
center position, but has been a major bust.  Tsakalidis still needs more time 
to develop and has played in only half of the Suns games so far.  If you 
drafted Tsakalidis you may want to give up on him for now and add a center 
that plays on a regular basis.    

 Shawn Marion , F PHO - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Marion had a monster game against the Warriors Wednesday.  He scored 19 
points, grabbed 19 rebounds, and blocked five shots.  Marion has been a major 
sleeper in the early part of the season, averaging 19.0 points and 10.6 rpg.  
If you have him on your Fantasy team hold on to him and start him.    

 Antawn Jamison , F GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Jamison started at small forward for Golden State Wednesday matching up 
against Minnesota's Wally Szczerbiak.  He started at power forward in the 
game prior to that.  Jamison will alternate at the forward spots until 
starting power forward Danny Fortson returns from his foot injury.  His 
scoring will remain about the same but look for Jamison to grab more rebounds 
at the power forward position.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip in Tuesday night's game against the 
Kings.  He spent much of Wednesday getting treatment, which will continue 
today before a decision on his availability for tonight's game is made. "If I 
had to guess now," said McGrady, "I'd say I'm going to try and play...we'll 
see."    

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/16/00 
 Jones missed last night's game in New Jersey with a strained calf.  He 
suffered the injury in the fourth quarter on Tuesday night against the 
Hornets. He considers himself "day to day."   

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Rose sat out of Wednesday night's game against Detroit after the team's 
medical personnel had determined that his injured left wrist was not yet 
sufficiently healed.  Rose, who was expected to play in the game, will now 
likely wait until sometime next week to return to action.    

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 The Cavaliers today waived Bryant, a 12-year veteran who had not appeared in 
a game this season. The 35-year-old forward-center had been on the injured 
list since October 30 with patellar tendinitis in his knees.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Livington was signed by the Golden State Warriors today after they placed 
Danny Fortson on the injured list. The 25-year-old was a free agent after 
posting 4.8 ppg, 1.6 rpg and 2.2 apg in 79 games with Detroit last season.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 The Warriors placed Fortson on the injured list today with a sore right 
foot. The league's leading rebounder, Fortson's injury is on the same foot he 
broke last season. Golden State signed free agent point guard Randy 
Livingston to take his roster spot.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Majerle said that he will miss "at least" two more weeks after re-injuring 
his left hamstring during Monday's practice.  "Obviously, I came back too 
soon," said Majerle, who was hoping to play in Tuesday night's game against 
Charlotte before the injury occurred.    

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Wallace left practice early on Tuesday after being hit in the face by an 
unidentified teammates' open hand.  He suffered a swollen right eye, but 
should be available for Wednesday night's game against the Pacers.  

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 Rose is expected to be in the starting lineup tonight for Indiana's Central 
Division matchup with the Detroit Pistons.  He has missed the Pacers' first 
six games after breaking his wrist during the preseason.  Fantasy owners who 
drafted Rose should be thrilled by his return, and hope he can duplicate his 
solid numbers of a year ago.  

 Rashard Lewis , F SEA - Fear Updated 11/15/00 
 With rookie Desmond Mason out of the mix at shooting guard, Lewis may spend 
some time at the position.  He has played mostly small forward in his career 
but started at shooting guard during his rookie season.  Lewis has shown some 
proficiency shooting from the outside.  He scored 22 points against the 
Knicks Tuesday hitting 4-of-7 three-point attempts.  His versatility may be 
valuable in a league where playing players at multiple positions is 
allowed.    

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Patterson replaced rookie Desmond Mason as the starting shooting guard 
Tuesday.  Mason who had been relatively unproductive as a starter was benched 
and did not play.  Patterson scored 10 points and grabbed four rebounds.  He 
is not known for his scoring but can pad his stats with rebounds, assists, 
and steals.  Patterson might be worth adding to your Fantasy team if you play 
in a deep league.     

 Brent Barry , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Barry has finally joined the Sonics lineup after missing the first six games 
with a sprained ankle.  He came off the bench and scored 14 points and had 
four rebounds in Tuesday's game against the Knicks.  Barry lost his starting 
shooting guard job in training camp but will continue to come off the bench 
until head coach Paul Westphal decides he wants to shake the lineup up 
again.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Sabonis was impressive in his season debut for the Blazers Tuesday.  He came 
off the bench and scored 12 points in 13 minutes.  Sabonis had been sidelined 
for the first eight games due to torn cartilage in his left knee.  Look for 
Sabonis to continue to come off the bench for Portland and play less minutes 
this year.  He will still give you you points, rebounds, blocks, and assists 
making him valuable as far as centers are concerned.     

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mills missed Tuesday's game against Cleveland due to a sore back.  He 
remains questionable for Wednesday's game at Minnesota.  When he does return 
he may be inserted into the starting lineup at small forward.  Starting power 
forward Danny Fortson will miss the next three games due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mullin was inserted into the starting lineup Tuesday against the Cavaliers 
at small forward alongside Antawn Jamison.  Playing in just his second game 
of the season, Mullin scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds.  He will 
most likely remain in the starting lineup until starting power forward Danny 
Fortson returns.  But the void in the starting frontcourt may also be filled 
by Chris Mills.  The 37-year old Mullin is still a solid shooter but his lack 
of quickness makes him a liability on defense.  His poor defense could cost 
him minutes of playing time.     

 J.R. Reid , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Reid was activated on Tuesday, filling the roster spot left vacant by Wesley 
Person, who is out with an elbow injury.  Reid has missed Cleveland's first 
six games with tendinitis in both knees.  

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Person was placed on the injured list on Tuesday with a bruised right 
elbow.  He averaged 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds over his first five games of 
the season.  His spot on the roster will be filled by J.R. Reid.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip flexor during Tuesday night's game in 
Sacramento.  He was injured in the first half, and played only 14 minutes 
after halftime.  "Right now I'm in a lot of pain," said McGrady.  "I don't 
know if I'll be able to go Thursday."  

 Cal Bowdler , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Bowdler was removed from the injured list today, filling the roster spot 
left by Roshown McLeod, who is out with an undiclosed ailment.  Bowdler has 
missed Atlanta's first eight games with a sprained MCL.

Controversy Rages Over Democratic Effort to Suppress Military
Absentee Ballots

 "...I happen to believe that, the military personal who sent
 their ballots in, should be allowed and should be counted...
 And I think we should look into it,  because we realize that
 when some of those ballots were sent off, many times the
 aircraft or the other vehicle utilized to transport them had
 to get on and they had to leave without the post marks. So I
 think the military should have some latitude in allowing
 those individuals to vote...."
     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 "...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I
 think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really
 want this straightened out because it is only fair and right
 to do that.'"
     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 "I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the
 groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all
 praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President
 Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it
 all involves veterans and all involves active duty service
 personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I
 think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every
 effort to count these ballots.'"
     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

 Tim Russert: "Will you today, as a representative of the
 Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots
 that came from armed services people and waive any so-
 called irregularities or technicalities which would
 disqualify them?"

 Senator Joseph Lieberman: "I don't know that I have that
 authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other
 way."
     - NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

NY Post Editorial
A Desperate Man, A Desperate Act
11/19/00

"How dare you, Al Gore?

"How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans
serving their country overseas?

"From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death
the right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per
person, one vote at a time?

"These are the real questions now facing the nation.

"Everything else is clutter.

"Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of
microphones outside the vice-presidential mansion in
Washington and said:

"'The American people want to make certain that every vote
counts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'"

"So far, so good.

"Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a
detailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were
working furiously to trash military absentee ballots -
presumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be
for George W. Bush than for Al Gore."

Why Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate


PALM BEACH COUNTY
 ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted
   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the
   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election
   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.

 ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and
   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile
   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found
   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the
   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of
   ballots was different the prior night and had been
   sabotaged.

   Example:
    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat
      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and
      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain
      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but
      couldn't.
    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore
      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without
      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach
      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.

 ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach
   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not
   use ballots to fan themselves.

 ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are
   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.
   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry
   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday
   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots
   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers
   stepped on the ballots.

 ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a
   second manual recount had to be conducted.

 ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little
   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the
   same time that people count, counters often roam the room
   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.

BROWARD COUNTY

 ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors
   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public
   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats
   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.

 ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are
   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors
   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits
   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers
   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and
   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct
   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were
   already being counted, etc.

 ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a
   manual count requires machine error, yet the board
   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count
   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman
   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no
   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised
   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for
   Gore).

 ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on
   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters
   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure
   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing
   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the
   counting until they do so.  Election officials,
   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the
   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day
   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and
   tables.

 ~ Considering altering the rules to include "dimpled"
   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the
   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County
   board is now considering including "dimpled" ballots as
   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy
   to gain additional votes.

DALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM
ABANDONING GORE
11/19/00

"Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly
informed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on
the hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources
told TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there
yet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -
'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way
to get the message to them, TIME reports in its current
issue....

"Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state
Katherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats
would start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is
enough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a
good loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-
afternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.
About 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk."

GORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS
11/18/00

"Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the
Democratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections
supervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence
to assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the
lawyer says.

"Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount
effort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to
Bruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa
LePore.

"'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in
favor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him
no. I told him we'd have to wait,'" Rogow said.

"Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for
Christopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give
certain advice to my client.'"

UPI Commentary
SLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE
11/18/00

"Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used
several strategies to set up a victory at the end of the
day....

"Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of
scrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact
sinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,
occasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for
Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be
engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since
Watergate.

"It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly
appropriate. Since the morning after the election, there
have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might
make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral
College.

"If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more
electoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican
electors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and
wins the White House.

"According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and
elsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team
leader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition
research project targeting Republican electors.

"Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is
working independently of the Gore campaign.

"Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has
publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I
think there is a presumption that those members who are
voting, vote based upon the election," he has said. 'I
believe the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I
would assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're
morally bound.'

"Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite
synonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's
project is that the lives of electors are going to be
examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave
former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.

"Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly
Democrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these
electors, and what do you know about them?' That is what
blackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for
Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.
The presidential election must not be decided based on late
night phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was
that woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency
and liberty demand it."

page at http://www.bestfares.com. Also, remember to visit our Newsdesk

where we post hundreds of deals every day that could save you up

**************************** November 16, 2000  ************************

Don=01,t worry about airfares going up. We=01,ll lock in a low fare for you=
 for
travel through August 15, 2001. This deal includes 90 cities and the
roundtrip fare is just $298 coast-to-coast. From California (home of a
million still uncounted absentee ballots) to Florida (where political
alligators wrestle for dominance), the country is at your disposal.

COAST-TO-COAST FOR $298 ROUNDTRIP--OR LESS.
It took us a few months to negotiate our new coast-to-coast fares because
we wanted the best deal possible. No recounts here=01*the deal is now signe=
d,
sealed and delivered. The airlines have given us five fare hikes this
year, as the majors try to cover higher fuel costs. Since saving money
fuels our engine, we sympathized but went on to secure maximum savings for
you. Fly coast-to-coast for $298 roundtrip or less on your choice of
several airlines. For example, if you want to fly from Burlington (VT) to
Los Angeles, the current 21-day advance purchase roundtrip is $742.
Between Seattle and Myrtle Beach, the current 21-day advance is $687. We
think you=01,ll agree that $298 looks a lot better. Discounts go as high as
60 percent for travel through August 15, 2001. Check out other travel Web
sites (we love competition), do some comparison shopping, and you can
understand how we=01,ve earned our low-fare wings and live up to the name,
Bestfares.com. For more information on our newest bargains, visit:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

ROUNDTRIPS BETWEEN THE MIDWEST & THE EAST COAST FOR $198-218
Fly between select U.S. cities for as low as $198 roundtrip through August
15, 2001. Travel from the Midwest or the south-central part of the country
to cities in the East on great sale fares--for example, Dallas/Fort Worth
to Charlotte is only $198 at Bestfares.com vs. $418. Our wide selection of
central cities on sale includes Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, St. Louis,
Minneapolis, Kansas City and many more. You have your choice of over 50
cities in the Eastern U.S.  These roundtrip fares range between $198 and
$218. Here=01,s a sample saving. The standard roundtrip fare between
Minneapolis and Portland (ME) sells for $548, but we have it for $218.
Your savings can be 60 percent or more. These prices are valid for travel
Monday through Thursday travel but for just $10 more each way, you can fly
on weekends. We went you to travel the world for less, and deals like this
make it possible. To view more of our deeply discounted fares, access

FLORIDA ON SALE FROM 50 CITIES FOR AS LITTLE AS $198 RT
Are you looking for cheap airfares to use to escape the cold weather? Do
you want to comb the beach for seashells (or search the cities for
chads?). Soothe the late fall/early winter blues with Florida sunshine for
as little as $198 roundtrip. Fly from 50 Midwest and Eastern cities to
Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tallahassee, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers,
Naples, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Miami or Key West. The cheapest
published fare between Chicago and Key West in January is $418 roundtrip.

August 15, so you can buy now for next year=01,s spring break or summer
vacation. Check out our fantastic Florida fare sale at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10107236

THREE-DAY ADVANCE FARES FOR $298 ROUNDTRIP OR LESS.
This is one of our favorite deals because it eliminates the high penalty
most travelers pay for last-minute trips. Our three-day advance purchase
fares are valid for travel through August 15, 2001. Now you can have peace
of mind when you need to travel with short notice--on a family emergency,
on a last-minute business trip or when an =01&I just have to get the heck o=
ut
of town=018 mood arises. You can realize savings of up to 80 percent on the=
se
fares and fly when you want to fly, with only a three-day advance. You can

AVOID AIRPORT DELAYS & MISSED FLIGHTS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
Are you heading toward an airport during the upcoming holidays?
Unfortunately, during this holiday season a record number of travelers
will take to the friendly skies which translates into huge crowds and
limited parking at the airport parking lots. Don=01,t waste valuable time
searching for an empty space in an over crowded parking lot. Just stop,
valet park, catch a shuttle and fly with our partner SunPark. SunPark is
offering spectacular holiday savings through the end of this year as low
as $6 per day.  They are also offering 20% off at all locations year-round
when you buy a convenient book of 10 pre-paid parking vouchers =01) which
also makes a great gift for the frequent flyer! If you live in one of the
cities below you should check out the economy and convenience of SunPark:
 Buffalo  Columbus  Houston
 Los Angeles  Memphis  Oklahoma City
 Philadelphia St. Louis  Washington, DC

Don=01,t be caught in the crowds this holiday season. Park your car at a
SunPark parking lot and enjoy savings and services not found at other
airport parking lots. For more information visit our feature story at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10107493 or visit the SunPark web
site at http://www.sunpark.com/sp_offrs.html.

Another storm pounds Telluride!

Short of hand-counting each snowflake that has fallen in Telluride, resort 
officials have projected that nearly 4 feet of snow has blanked the area in 
the past three weeks. 9 inches of fresh snow fell overnight to the 
overwhelming joy of town residents. Resort officials are reporting a 29-inch 
base on the mountain, with more than a week to go before the ski area opens 
to skiers and snowboarders.

"Gearing up for one of the resort's best openings in recent history ranks up 
there, as far as current events, with finding out who our next Presidnet will 
be," said Steve Swenson, vice president of sales, marketing and air service 
for the Telluride Ski & Golf Company.

Have a great day and think snow!

Just thought ya'll would like to know.

And Chad, I'll save you the trouble - Mack Brown is a terrible coach and all 
he can do is recruit.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 "The Edge" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.  

 Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week. He 
will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.

Please forward to your respective personnel.

There will be 2 demos of the New SITARA Risk Assignment release this Thursday 
(Jan 13) in room EB 2537 from 11:15-12:15, and 1:00-2:00.

Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment  

I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say " well that is what 
you say every year"), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of
Hemphill, TX.  He is rated by Rivals as the #1 lineman prospect in the
country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.

Hey Dad,

Did you talk to the better half?  I was thinking Trulucks but if you can't 
attend I understand.

Let me know,

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by=
=20
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is no=
w=20
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.    =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for=20
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and=
=20
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall unt=
il=20
he appears to be fully recovered.   =20

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00=20
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=
=20
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=
=20
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his=
=20
Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=
=20
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have mu=
ch=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
"I can't give you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but=
=20
it looks good." Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will=
=20
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=
d=20
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does retu=
rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=
e=20
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host=
=20
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=
ir=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. "Air Canada" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. "We=
'd=20
like to have him back as soon as possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,=
=20
"but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready." Toronto finishes=
=20
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at=
=20
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be bac=
k=20
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup i=
n=20
time for next week.   =20

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago=20
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a=20
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in=20
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from=20
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your=
=20
starting lineup.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against=20
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left kne=
e,=20
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day =
to=20
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday=20
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy=
=20
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next=
=20
week's games.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00=20
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that=
=20
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all=
=20
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudle=
y=20
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to=
=20
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding=20
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his=
=20
position.   =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain =
in=20
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and=
=20
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mil=
ls=20
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop h=
im=20
from your roster and add another forward.    =20

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. =
=20
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's stat=
us=20
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment =
so=20
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your=20
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The=
=20
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bett=
er=20
guard.   =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Williams sprained his ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is=
=20
questionable for Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably=
=20
limit Williams' production in the next few games so use a healthy forward=
=20
instead.   =20

 Billy Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Owens strained his right biceps in Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He h=
as=20
actually been productive this season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.=
 =20
Owens has been injury prone throughout his career and is too risky a player=
=20
to take a chance on.  Use a more durable player instead.    =20

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He scored=
=20
12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the starting=
=20
lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With an increas=
ed=20
role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.   =20

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Wallace was placed on the injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.=
 =20
He is a good offensive player but his shortcomings on defense have limited=
=20
his playing time.  His lack of playing time prevents him from being a=20
productive Fantasy player so avoid using him in your league     =20

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.

It Costs So Little, And It Means So Much

As you are aware, if the voting results in
Florida stand as they are now, George W.
Bush will be our next President. This will
have catastrophic results in our vital,
indispensable, entertainment industry.

Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin, among many
others have sworn to leave the country if George
W. Bush is elected President.

And this is where YOU can help. We need
volunteers to help pack and load moving vans.
We also need volunteers to provide airfare for
these irreplaceable national treasures so they
can relocate before they can change their minds.

For the cost of a small SUV you can sponsor
one of these celebrities and their unfortunate
relocation. You will know that your efforts are
helping when you receive postcards, letters and
pictures from your chosen "refugee" as they
learn to become a useful citizen in the
third world country of their choosing.

You will help, won't you? It costs so little,
but it means so much.

Call 1-800-deport-a-lib. Operators are standing by.
Major credit cards are accepted.

Subject: Wed . Night scrimmage/practice

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.



IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...


===


If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb 
Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.


We spot them:  Total Bet:

9 pts   $50
15 pts   $300
22 pts   $500-$600
30 pts   $1,000

He seems to be extra confident in that he has a former Division 2A 
quarterback... Drew Teamlys  (sp?).

Subject: Tonight's Gathering - National Championship

Hello Everyone,

I hope that you all enjoyed the holidays, and I'd venture to say that most of 
you enjoyed it more than I did.  I did however have a great New Years.  It 
actually inspired this email.  On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New 
Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't 
gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.  We were 
thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.  It's located at 
6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-6700).  Also, I think we are going to do 
Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.  Please let me 
know if you plan on attending.  I think we are going to head over there 
between 6:30 - 7:00.

Hope to see you all tonight!!

LISA

I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the complaint 
form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna

How about a practice on Wednesday and a scrimmage with the other UT team on

Scrimmages are fun and all but we need to practice - several times this 
week.  I am serious about these tickets, so I want to practice as much as 
possible between now and Saturday.  Let's set something up for tonight and 
tomorrow night!  
I have asked Chris Gaskill (Ex- UT baseball player) to play, he is going to 
let me know ASAP.  So, if either of you know him, give him a call.

Let me know about practice.

Major breakthrough, we have 16 tickets.  Now we need to win 'em.  After the 
f'''aggies near victory vs. ou, these tickets are now priceless.  Therefore, 
we must win at all cost THIS Saturday, the 18th.  

The team to date is as follows:

Stephen 
Eric
Luis
Paul
Sarah   
Myself
Christopher Chenoweth - new addition (recruited away from Webb Jennings' team 
at no small cost)

One other unnamed guy (Luis, I need this name).

===

To do:

1.   I need all of you to confirm (by voice or email) that you will be able 
to play on Saturday.  If I don't hear from you, I will have to replace you.  
If you think there is a chance that you won't make, please contact me ASAP.

2.   We need to deliver $2,000 in donations.  If you haven't started bringing 
in donations, please do so immediately.  I have the donation envelopes, 
contact me and I'll have one sent to you.

3.  We will have a scrimmage this Wed. or Thurs.  so mark your calender.  I 
encourage you all to take whatever steps necessary to see to your physical 
preparation for this game.  

My extension is 37842.   Home phone is 713-864-6229.

WE HAVE 16 TICKETS FOR THE WINNING TEAM!!!

Thanks to Brandon Houston and the Andersen Consulting team for finding the 
tickets!!!!!  Brandon will bring the tickets to the game on Saturday for 
distribution to the event winners.

The tickets will cost $560.  Enron will need to pay for half of the tickets.  
Ted, please coordinate with Karen Marshall in community relations to have a 
check for Brandon.

Thanks everyone!  We are now in excellent shape for the game on Saturday.  
Keep collecting those donations this week.  All Enron donation packets 
received by Brad Mauritzen by 5pm Friday night will be counted towards the 
kick or receive ball option at the game.

Shelly

A Report From the 2000 World Women's Liberation Conference The
 first speaker, a lady from England stood up and said,"During last years'
conference we spoke about being more assertive with our husbands.
 Well, after the conference I went home and told my husband,
 Barrington,that I would no longer cook for him and that he would have to do
it himself!
 After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw
nothing.But on the third day, I saw that he had cooked a wonderful roast
lamb." The crowd cheered.
 The second speaker, a lady from Russia stood up and said, "After last
years'conference I went home and told my husband, Ivan, that I would no
longer do his laundry and that he would have to do it himself.
After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw nothing.But
on the third day, I saw that he had done not only his own washing, but my
washing as well." The crowd again cheered.
 The third speaker, a Cajun lady from Thibodaux, Louisiana, stood
 up and said, "Afta last years' conference, I went rat home and tole dat
lazy Coonass husband'a mine, Boudreaux, dat I wadn't gonna do no mo'a his
cookin', cleanin' or shoppin' and dat he wuz gonna have to do it all fer
hissef."  The crowd got to their feet and roared approval.  When it became
quiet, she continued, "And I tole'em I wadn't gonna be
doin'no mo cleanin' em nasty crawfeesh, giggin' no mo boolfrogs and water
dawgs, skinnin' none'a dem musrats and nutrias or check'n no mo
catfeesh trotlines."
The crowd went wild - the cheering and clapping lasted for at
least five minutes. Well, the fust day,I didn't saw nuttin'.  Afta the
second day, I didn't saw nuttin'too. But afta the thud day, I could saw a
little bit outta my left eye."

   I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I
   really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting
   dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas.

   Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the
   Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I
   guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later.

   Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a
   call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I
   didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during
   lunch.

Hey Shirley,

I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
to
let you know all of the details.

See you soon.

-Eric

Hi Folks, 
?
Just a few quick notes on this short Thanksgiving  week.
?
?
?
No Problems for Faulk / Kurt Warner  One more Week:? From USA Today's?Ram's 
Page:? "In other  injury news, Marshall Faulk experienced no problems with 
his right knee the day  after the game. Martz said quarterback Kurt Warner 
almost certainly would miss  one more game before returning from a broken 
little finger on his throwing hand.  Two pins were removed from Warner's 
finger Monday and he'll throw Wednesday  through Friday in practice, but will 
not take any snaps. ''(The doctors) want  him to have another week before 
that hand is jarred by anything, just to make  sure it sets real well,'' 
Martz said. 
?
It should be noted that Warner is more optimistic  about playing than his 
coach is.? Don't take the coach's word as  gospel.? Remember, it was Martz 
who?a few days ago?was saying  Faulk likely wouldn't play Monday night and if 
he did, he'd be very  limited.? I'm not saying he's less than truthful.? I'm 
saying these  things change.? If I had to guess though, I'd say it's one more 
week of  Trent Green.
?
?
?
Tony Horne Out 6 Weeks:? From  USA Today: Tony Horne will be sidelined an 
estimated six weeks with a ligament  damage to his left big toe. Coach Mike 
Martz described the injury Tuesday as  ''severe turf toe.''? He'll likely be 
replaced by CB Dre Bly.
?
?
Ray Crockett Hamstring:?  Denver CB Ray Crockett tore his hamstring Sunday.? 
You may have seen it  when he went down and Ryan Leaf was able to hit Jeff 
Graham for the long  TD.? It looked pretty bad.? I thought he'd dislocated 
his hip the way  he pulled up.? Jimmy Spencer will fill in.?That hurts as the 
team gets  ready for Seattle.? The Seahawks are no passing juggernaut but 
neither were  the Chargers...
?
?
Mike Alstott Done? Tampa Bay  is calling Mike Alstott's knee injury a 3rd 
degree sprain of the medial  collateral ligament (MCL) and he'll likely miss 
6-8 weeks which of course means  he's done for FF purposes.? His leg is being 
placed in a cast for 10  days.? Surgery doesn't look to be required and it's 
a tough blow for the  big guy.? Look for more carries from Warrick Dunn.
?
?
Curtis Martin  Questions?? I've had a ton of requests for more info on the  
Curtis Martin situation which is now being called a hip injury instead of a  
lower back injury.? Coach Al Groh is being his usual guarded self with the  
"if he plays he plays" type comments.? We'll know more here soon and will  
shoot it to you.? 
?
?
Scott Mitchell  Improving??? CBS Sportsline is reporting Scott  Mitchell's 
sprained knee is improving.?? He's listed as doubtful but  is reportedly 
making good progress.? With visions of Akili Smith in their  heads, I'm sure 
he's getting lots of encouragement.? Seems weird to be  getting excited about 
Scott Mitchell but the truth is he looked pretty good  Sunday.? His play was 
great news for Peter Warrick fans.? He makes  Corey Dillon better too.
?
?
Jeff George to Start??  Coach Norv Turner said today that unless Brad 
Johnson's knee is 100% healthy,  Jeff George would start.? Most reports are 
that Johnson's knee is not 100%  yet.? One more great game from George and 
this will be very  interesting.
?
?
Donald Hayes 50/50??  KFFL.com is reporting George Seifert said that WR 
Donald Hayes is questionable  for this week's game with a bad groin.?RB 
Tshimanga Biakabutuka is still  hobbled with a bad foot so the Panthers can 
ill afford to lose Hayes  too.
?
?
James Stewart Hopeful??  KFFL.com is reporting: "James Stewart (hip pointer) 
and Mario Bates (knee) were  wearing red jerseys during Monday's practice. 
Red jerseys mean the players  aren't allowed to be hit. Lions head coach Gary 
Moeller stated he thinks Stewart  will be able to play Thursday against the 
Patriots. 
?
?
?
These are just a few quick ones for you.?  We'll have our full blown Players 
in the News Wednesday night.? See you  then.
?
Joe

Latest Terrell Davis Info  From Adam Schefter in the Denver Post:  From the
article   http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/brnx1121b.htm   "This is the
kind of season it has been for Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis: He
has twice as many magnetic resonance imaging tests as touchdowns.
Davis underwent his fourth MRI on Monday and, like the previous three, the
results were negative. Yet Davis still is concerned enough about his lower
left leg, which has been bothering him for nearly a month and wants a
specialist in San Francisco to study the results.
"It's just kind of a cross-check with a guy that's known to be pretty good,"
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. "He's still quite sore, and we want to
make sure that we rule out all possibilities."
But not even the specialist in San Francisco will be able to predict whether
Davis will be able to play Sunday in Seattle, or any time in the near
future.
"I thought he was going to play this last week; then he set it back and
didn't practice Saturday morning," Shanahan said. "I don't think anybody
knows. We just have to wait and see."
At this point, the Broncos are carrying on as if rookie running backs Mike
Anderson and KaRon Coleman will be carrying the load. "You've got to,"
Shanahan said. "If he's there, it's a plus, and we'd like him to be there
full speed.
"But he keeps on setting that leg back. How long that pain's going to be
there I don't think anybody knows. We'll just have to go on. Mike Anderson
did a great job last game, played exceptionally well, and he has got to pick
up the slack.''



My View:   Mike Shanahan is no Bill Belichick, when it comes to coachspeak,
but he's not far behind.  He's saying basically the only things he can say.
If I'm a Terrell Davis owner, I probably sit him this week unless I just
didn't have many other options.  I'd say the chances of him playing
effectively this week are in the 40% range.  Anderson had 138 total yards
Sunday.  He ran for 97 yards on 19 carries for a 5.1 yard per carry average.
And that was against a San Diego rush defense that was ranked # 2 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four games.  In other words, the
running game isn't a big problem for Mike Shanahan right now.  He's got
other things to worry about (like replacing CB Ray Crockett).  The fact they
haven't been able to nail down the exact problem is worrisome to me.  Bottom
line is I'm thinking Anderson as of right now.

Good Luck!

Joe

Hi all!

We went looking at puppies this weekend, supposedly
just "to look," and of course end up bringing one
home!  She has already made the trip to the office and
one of my co-workers had his digital camera here to
take pictures for Halloween!

Hope to talk to each of you soon!

Love, Julia

Hey y'all,

Thought ya might get a kick outta this, nothin much goin on here, just a
buncha rain.



AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA
(to the tune of "The Devil Went Down To Georgia", by Charlie Daniels band)

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.

He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a deal.

When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard Veep
Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, "Gov, let me tell you what"

"I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.

Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.

I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!"

The gov'ner said, "My names Dubya and it might be a sin....

But I'll take that bet, your gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins"

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.

Cause Al Gores loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.

If you win you get that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al
Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said "I'll start this show"

And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.

And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.

Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin' thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...

"Well, your pretty good ol' son Now plant your butt in that chair right
there and let me show you how it's done!"

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.

You can't lose now in the land of the sun.

Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in the White House,
God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

Al Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.

He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.

Dubya said, "Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!"

My friend Catherine Miller, local Denver resident  and Broncos fanatic told 
me tonight that the Channel 9 News in Denver is  reporting that Terrell Davis 
is out indefinitely.? They've found  inflammation in his shin bone and are 
now immobilizing his leg with a  cast.? They're not yet saying he's out the 
for the season but it definitely  does not look good at this point.? More as 
I hear it.? Thanks  Cat!

Nah, you pretty much got good plays.  I don't know about the diversity of 
lamination but a thinner one that folds would be appreciated.

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
review.

The top 20 "Party Schools," according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan
13.  University of Vermont
14. Ohio State University
15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara
20.  Union College
The top 20 "Stone Cold Sober Schools," according to the Princeton  Review:
1. Brigham Young University
2. Wheaton College
3. California  Institute of Technology
4. U.S. Naval Academy
5. U.S. Coast Guard  Academy
6. Samford University
7. Cooper Union
8. Wellesley  College
9. Mount Holyoke College
10. Calvin College
11. Haverford  College
12. Golden Gate University
13. U.S. Air Force Academy
14.  College of the Ozarks
15. Grove City College
16. Wells College
17.  Simmons College
18. Illinois Institute of Technology
19. Colorado School  of Mines
20. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

I can only think of the Storage Puts and the Desk Mgmt fee ($120,000) as 
prudencies still out there.  Is there any others you might remember?

replacing those pages with all of our group on Page 6, and rollover lines on

The type of power is key.  There is a huge difference between your basic
Aiwa amplifier in comparison to Harmon Kardon.  If you tell me what kind of
speakers he wants, that would help.  ALso, is he using an Amp or a receiver?

A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really
likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered
amp.
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Thanks

Janet,

Here is the model.  I have added unit costs.  Let me know if you have any 
other questions.

I still need to get the delivery locations for the CSW deal.


Thanks,


Eric

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

We have had a request to change from a draft to an auction system for 
acquiring players.  Please take a look at www.fanball.com and take the links 
to the auction ( I think it is Auctions A-Z) and let me know which option you 
think is better.

TO ALL ELECTION INTEGRITY INTERNET ACTIVISTS:

Keep it up! The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.

It's only a matter of time before they're going to have to
back off on their support for Al Gore and join the call for
him to concede.

For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayor
of El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliation
from Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirty
tactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.

Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, "Over 600,000 servicemen
and women gave their lives in this last century to ensure
American freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this same
right. I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when the
leader of the Democratic Party, supported by other elected
Democrat officials take this position. This is the final
straw. I didn't leave my party - my party left me."

It's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore and
even elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.

And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.  Disenfranchising the
military is as low as you sink.  As American citizens we owe
a debt of gratitude to the military.

The least we can do is defend their fundamental right to
vote.

If you want more info on this issue, go to
http://www.countthemilitary.com/root/A374.cfm
The site is sponsored by the United States Justice
Foundation a non-profit legal foundation that's suing the
Florida Elections Commission to make sure military votes
are properly counted.  They're also trying to put pressure
on the House and Senate Armed Forces Committees to fully
investigate why and how many military ballots were tossed
out of the Florida Election.

I highly recommend that you check out this site and send
any of your friends or relatives who are in the military
to that site also.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

BESTFARES.COM is your source for HOT TRAVEL DEALS. Visit our home
page at http://www.bestfares.com. Also, remember to visit our Newsdesk
daily at http://www.bestfares.com/travel_center/desks/newsdesk.asp
where we post hundreds of deals every day that could save you up

**************************** November 28, 2000  ************************

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!

Hey Guys,  I just typed a small novel (below) about JRTC and thought I send
it out, it's answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated
comabt stuff works and has an example at the end.




Excellent question (about what makes the bad guys run away during an
exercise).


The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make "laser tag" stuff for us.

It's called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an
exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal
Load Bearing Vest(LBV), the harness has four receptors on the front and four
on the back, in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that
goes on the kevlar helmet.  Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them,
every thing from HMMV's to the tanks to the helicopters.

Our weapons systems have transmitters on them, it'll look like a little box
mounted on the front of the weapon, the box has a pressure sensor so every
time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down
range.  If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this
God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is down/dead.
AT-4's and Dragons (bazooka like anti-armor weapons) are simulated by what
are called Vipers, same weight, same size, except it fires a big powerful
laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES.  The
armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat.  There are two types of kills on a
tank, a Mobility kill, and a critical kill.  If the Viper or other weapon
doesn't have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area, a mobility kill
will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but
its' radios and weapons still work.  A critical kill means, the vehicle and
all inside are dead dead dead.  If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES
gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios.  The guy will
just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice
say, "Critical kill" and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after
that are the brakes.

So, direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate, target wears a
receptor, shooter fires a transmitter.

Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult,  whereas before the
shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser
beam on target, artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see.

There are two ways around this.   At the National Training Center (NTC)
where they do all the armor against armor training, they have the MILES 2000
system.  You have an armored motorized rifle company(MRC) sitting at point
X,  I have an observer 15Km away who, with optics can see your
MRC, my FO calls in a fire mission, based on the target description a Bn 3
will be fired (54 rounds fired in 3 volleys as there are only 18 tubes in a
Bn.  The Observer-Controllers (OCs), kinna like referees, will monitor the
Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes, and the OCs will take the fire
mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into
account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun
batteries (instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries (6
guns)) may have made.  When the gun batteries tell the observer that they
have pulled the trigger, the OCs, who are always listening, will pull the
Miles trigger.  What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will
blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area 18
artillery rounds would take up, it will do this 3 times to simulate all 3
volleys landing.  Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as
damaged/destroyed.

At JRTC where the Light Fighters (i.e. no armor assets organic to them)
learn to play,  we don't get no stinkin satellites.  What we do there is,
when a fire mission is called to the guns, the OCs will monitor it and enter
the data in their computers, the computer will take into account any errors
made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate,  this grid
will be passed to a "Fire Marker" which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler,
a GPS, and a god gun (a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill
laser i.e. men to tanks and aircraft).  I say crazy because these guys are
civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid.
  Their average response time is 4 1/2 minutes, which is about 3 minutes
longer then it would be in real life so it's not as cool as MILES 2000.  So
you'll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses 4 wheelers
tryin to get to their target grids on time, and God help you if he pulls up
into your position and no you can't haul ass if you see one comin your way
cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he
sees you runnin from a fire marker.  I'll close this bad boy with a little
story.

"Oh shit, there I was" (all good 'war' stories gotta start with this).
We had started the first phase of the rotation, "Entry into the Box" (the
box is the JRTC engagement area) at 2300hrs the previous night and had
fought our way 7 Km SW hand railing a road, identifying mine/wire obstacles
and eliminating the Observers over watching them.  It was 0800 the next
morning and we were dead f-kin tired and had finally reached our main
objective which was a road inter-section in a semi wooded area just to the
south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)
was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets.  There was a BIG
triangular berm area just off the road, basically the dirt walls were 10 ft
tall 50 yard long.  We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at
the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend, which was good
cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath, plus our COLT
team (Combat Observer Laser Team = mounted (on a HMMVV) FO's with Laser
designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles, basically vehicle
killers) and Bradley support vehicles had just 'discovered' (BOOM) a mine
field at the intersection, this was happening as we were occupying the berm.
  So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the
vehicles, the 1SG and a couple of joes. 3 min later the 1SG and his team
were nailed by anti-personnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying
to aid the wounded inside the vehicles.  At the same time a "Civilian" truck
with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive
right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to
stop/search the vehicle (at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray
Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs, because in real life there are COBs
and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the
same time).  So we got the 1SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle, a
COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the
obstacle.  By this time we had been in this BIG berm (read TRP (Target
Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just
waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to
get a mission off)) for like 15 minutes when sure enough off in the distance
we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder.  We were so tired
we were basically denying the obvious, "there's no way he's headed for us,
please God don't let him be headed for us" basically you had an entire
company in a 100 yard radius which is about the same size as a 82mm mortar
impact area.  So there we are listening to this 4 wheeler get closer and
closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and
get ready to HAUL ass.  Of course we can't legally run until the first round
impacts.  So this guys comes tearin down the road, shoots off the road and
pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm, jumps off his bike and starts
UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators (basically a little flare gun that
pops 1/4 sticks of TNT up 40 ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds.
Note: these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground
burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops).  Basically what this told
us is that we were setup, the baddies were just waitin for us cause the
rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment.  So yeah,
this joker is poppin off airburst TNT, after the first burst I yelled
INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS.  Luckily I was close to the exit and
started movin out FAST, because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just
sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get
out.  I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good 200M because I'm
Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers.  I looked
back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm.
Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were
safe.  As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked
em all (16 guys).  As the rest of the people who made it out were still
runnin, about 25 of us and we were all now 150-200M North of the berm,
scattered all over hell.  Little bunches of 5-6 guys runnin to trees and
collapsing.  Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm, we hear
this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about 50M to our left and from
lower ground.  Sure enough it's a DsHKA (read Dishka, basically a 50 Cal on
a friggin truck bed),  so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left
and enemy 82mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends.  Since the DsHKA was a
high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin "Holy Shit we got a
DsHKA here, Grid 785436 HELLLLPPPP!!!"  At the same time we got Infantry
guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their M4's while
trying to get two Vipers together (we were told by the OC's that the only
thing they've ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the
same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time)  but the Viper teams
were scattered all over hell.  All this happened within about 30 seconds,
the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up
so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowa's (scout helicopters but they're
armed).  So we're pinned down, trying to suppress this truck while dodgin 50
Cal laser blasts (since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the
laser).  FINALLY the Kiowas show up (actually they got there respectably
fast only 2-3 minutes) chase the bastard down and smash him with their
hellfires.  With 30 of 65 guys dead, and one DsHKA down, we were ready to
get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other 2 DsHKAs that
were supposed to be in the area.

Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us, it was really a pretty nice
setup on the enemies part.  We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious
terrain feature, one that was no doubt on the Enemy's target lists.  So when
the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm
there the 50 cal was waitin to mow down whoever didn't get killed by the
Arty.

Anyways, that's one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest
e-mails I've ever written. So I'm gonna forward it to the rest of the guys.

Welp, its about time to go get my drink on, talk to y'all later.

LAWLER,OUT.

By unanimous vote we will pre-determine the draft order.  So, if nobidy has 
any objections, I will pick the draft order here at work under the scrutinhy 
of several other players ( Dave B, O. Winfree, M. Lenhart, M. Walters).

Also, by majority vote, will have a required tight end posn.  Meaning the 
starting lineups will include 1QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def.


Please e-mail back if you are ok with me picking the draft order.

Eric

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian


All games are on Wednesday nights at Jaycee Park ballfield
9/6 8:30pm vs. Raiders
9/13 7:30pm vs. Jay Ballers

I went by some houses last night . . .


This house was by far the nicest and best bang for your buck, but in a 
suspect neighborhood - it looks like they are building a lot of townhouses 
close though
check it out . . . 
http://www.har.com/search/condo/indexdetail.cfm?mlnum=203161

These were nice too - more contemporary though . . .

We should probably go look at these on Sunday.

Love,

ELECTION INTEGRITY UPDATE

Keep up the fight!
The walls are closing in on Vice President Al Gore. Both
the U.S. Supreme Court and the Leon County Circuit
Court in Florida ruled against Al Gore in two separate legal
battles.  First, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Florida Supreme Court had no legal justification for
extending the deadline for manual recounts.  The full text
of the Supreme Court decision is posted on our website at
http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/A363.cfm

The second blow to Gore came when Leon County Circuit
Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls ruled against his plea to
further extend the manual recounts.

Here's what Judge Sauls had to say:

"In order to contest election results . . . the plaintiff
must show that but for the irregularity or inaccuracy claim,
the result of the election would have been different and he
or she would have been the winner," said Sauls. "In this
case, there is no credible statistical evidence ...that the
results of the statewide election in in the state of Florida
would be different from the results certified by the election
canvassing board."

In the aftermath of these latest decisions, Mr. Gore has two
choices: drag on the fight to overturn the election in a
vain attempt to  discredit George W. Bush's legitimacy as
President-elect -- or, for the good of the people, concede.


As you know, Election Integrity is collecting online letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede.  Over 220,000 Americans
have signed in less than a week.   If you haven't already --
please go to our site and do it now.

We are so close to the end of this mess.  Let's keep up the
pressure.  PLEASE forward this message to your friends and
family and ask them to urge Al Gore to do the right thing
for our country -- CONCEDE.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

We are getting a group together to play paintaball tomorrow at around 10 am.  
We will be playing at Adventure Village (just north of Intercontinental 
Airport on FM 1960).  Their website is www.adventurevillage.com.  The total 
cost should be somewhere between $30-$40 per person ( about $15 for a gun and 
$6 per 100 paintballs).  Let me know if you can make it.

I know you had asked for some info on Texas previously.  Sorry it is so late, 
but here is a map of Tx pieplines.  The most notable (that are no on the 
current pipeline map) are Oasis, Lonestar, Valero, and HPL.


Thanks,

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Quinton Spotwood , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00 
 Spotwood was signed to the New York Giants' practice squad on Tuesday. He 
had been in both Dallas and Miami's camps during the season. Spotwood has no 
Fantasy value.   

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 "The Edge" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.

AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.
He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a
deal. When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard,
Veep Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, "Gov, let me tell you what"

"I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.
I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!"

The gov'ner said, "My names Dubya and it might be a sin....  But I'll
take that bet, you're gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins"

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.  Cause Al
Gore's loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.  If you win you get
that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said "I'll start this show"
And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.
And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.
Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin'
thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...  "Well, your pretty good ol' son.
Now plant your butt in that chair right there and let me show you how it's
done!"

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.  You can't lose now in the 
land of the sun.  Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in 
the White
House, God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

AL Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.
He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.
Dubya said, "Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!"

I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

No biggie ... give me a call back when you get a chance to chat some more
:))

Yep, we ate at the rainforest ... the atmosphere is AWESOME ... definitely
worth eating there for the experience ... but, the food is nothing special
... different stuff to choose from but a little overpriced for the tastiness
....
anyway ... that's my rating :))
the one in orlando is much better than the one in houston ............

Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you back yesterday- swamped over here-
especially after being gone all of last week.

Keep me posted on what ya'll want to do for Michelle's birthday.

Didn't you tell me that ya'll had eaten once at the Rainforest Cafe?  How
was that?  Eric was asking me about it- and I thought I remembered you
telling me that you had went awhile back.

Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do 
have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will 
not show up.  So, let me know whether or not you will be there.

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.


What do you think?

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20

Take a 20 oz. soda bottle (plastic one) and fill it 3/4 the way  with water. 
Freeze it and use to keep perishable food cold. Put  in a zip lock bag to 
keep from dripping. When the bottle unthaws,  use as drinking water. Throw 
away (or recycle) soda bottle when  empty. -Joyce W.

The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.

Brian, Hector, and Lenny have dropped out (what a shocker).  Steve Venturatos 
has graciously offered to take their place.  

Thanks Steve.

Hi Folks,

Keeping with the "you know what I know" philosophy here.

Still checking on confirmations but wanted to pass this along to you from
one of our subscribers, Greg Divers.

Greg just sent me this email:

"WSCR 1160AM in Chicago just reported that Bears' WR Marcus Robinson is done
for the year because of a bulging disk in his back."

Thanks Greg.  While this is bad news for those hoping for a Robinson
comeback, at least it gives you a jump in the week for planning how to fill
the void.  More tonight as I hear it.

Joe

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              A MESSAGE FROM DONALD L. EVANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Friend,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance
with Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme
Court, and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that
state's 25 electoral votes.  It is now time to get on with the
business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of
incorporation for the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As past transition
foundations have done, we have applied for 501(c)(4) status from
the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as
our team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition
process in the short period between now and inauguration day,
January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in
1988, specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it
also makes provisions for raising contributions from private
sources to help defray transition-related expenses.  This has
been done previously, most recently in 1992.  We are now
soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  Would
you please visit our new transition website at
http://www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our
secure server?  AOL link: <a href=http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/>Bush + 
Cheney Transition</a>

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from
individuals.  No corporate or political action committee
contributions will be accepted.  Contributions may not exceed
$5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all contributors, in
compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure of
financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website
on a real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against
an individual's annual political contribution federal giving
limit of $25,000

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to
establish a government that will unify our country and make the
common principles we share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's
finance office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries
should be directed to our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900.
Your support of the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,

Donald L. Evans
Board of Directors
Bush-Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, Inc.

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll=20
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=

$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

Subject: Chili Taster


Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was
visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous
celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one
else
wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last
moment,
and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking
directions
to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two
judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and
besides
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to
put the
               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
                        seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
people
               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on
my face.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by
now.
               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the

               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
with fresh refills;
               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like
this nuclear-waste
               I'm eating.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
                       considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
contestant
               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given
me brain
               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring
beer directly
               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the
other judges asked
               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice

                       and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
                        Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
sulfuric
               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except
big Sally.
               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
chili
                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
am worried
                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit
of distress
                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't

                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and
the world sounds
                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered
with chili which
                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of
lava-like stuff to
                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll
know what
                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too
painful. Screw it, I'm
                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just
suck it in through
                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
not too bold
                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.
JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
hot. Sorry
                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge
Number 3 passed out,
                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.
Not sure if he's going
                        to make it. Poor Yank.
FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report)

Welcome back to my old friends and I look forward to meeting my first-timers.

I will set up a meeting with you between now and December 13th.

I will also talk to your current supervisor/ direct report during this same 
period.

Please complete your Reviewer Suggestion List now and bother your supervisor 
to go into PEP and approve it.

I will want a personal profile from each of you with the following;

Education
Brief job history (non-ene)
Rotations at Enron and to whom you reported
Current job description (projects underway, etc.)
Accomplishments this year (include 1st half)

You only need to get me this information the day before we meet, but for 
those over-achievers, or over-worriers, I wanted to give you time to work on 
it.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]

Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
morning.

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
midnight Monday.

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.

On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
.22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
the steering wheel column.

After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
clavicle and was treated and released.

"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
might both be dead" stated Wallis.

"I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
happened," said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
Way to go, Lavinia)

1   Talking Points to Set the Record Straight
2   Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III
3   What They're Saying...
_________________________________________________________________


1
TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have
never been counted.

BOIES:  "[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been
counted once for the presidency of the United States."  [Today
Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once
  on election night and again during the automatic recount.

~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots
  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in
  every race on the ballot, including races for President.

~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,
  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in
  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.

~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)
  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute
  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots
  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for
  President.

~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote
  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be
  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a
  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may
  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable
  with his or her party's choice for President and yet
  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or
  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for
  President.


MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been
counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead
by 9 votes.

FACT:
~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and
  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach
  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by
  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of
  the certified votes from Nassau County.

~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday
  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory
  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.

~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme
  Court's deadline.

~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not
  proceeding with a manual recount.

~ The 157 "interim gain" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a
  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won
  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while
  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be
  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican
  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those
  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,
  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities
  in a discriminatory fashion.

~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and
  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and
  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military
  ballots should not be rejected.


MYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not
for the Republican "mob" that "intimidated" the canvassing board.

   KLAIN:  "We think already almost 160 votes were counted in
   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think
   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a
   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a
   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept
   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the
   kind of end that we have to American elections."
   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's
  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it
  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit
  the recount to only a select set of the votes.

~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the
  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated
  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.

~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,
  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was
  quieted promptly.


MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by
adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by
the board as illegal.

FACT:
~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from
  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124
  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election
  night.

~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor
  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the
  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final
  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of
  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the
  count to make it accurate.

~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to
  certify the original election night count - which included the
  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which
  mistakenly omitted those ballots).

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit
contesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their
aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of
counts and recounts.

As I said last night, America has never had a presidential
election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.
This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,
uncertain, and controversial territory.

Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of
the litigation team who will be defending the vote of
Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.

I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,
Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.
Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of
Florida, has 33 years of trial experience.

Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of
the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they
bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.

The other two members of our senior litigation team are law
partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,
Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience
practicing in court.

These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the
overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on
four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Quotes from Democrats:

"It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last
legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should."
  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;
    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00


U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately
decided by the U.S. House of Representatives.

"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth
Congressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush
carried [my district]."
  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00


Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on
Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election
in doubt for 20 days.

"He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.
President, congratulations. I support you as president 100
percent."
  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00


Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's "Hardball
with Chris Matthews," 11/27/00:
"They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes
didn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's
votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,
many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that."


Quotes from Media:

Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's "Hannity and Colmes," 11/27/00:
"...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without
having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of
thought and logic and argument...

"You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush
or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get
counted..."


Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:
"His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday
night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was
almost insulting."


Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's "Imus in the Morning,"
11/28/00:
Imus:  "What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the
roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in
this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be
treating all this if the roles were reversed."

Fineman: "Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush
was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed
President.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks
on Bush would be just absolutely vicious."


Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Connolly:  "But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that
you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.
And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he
started talking about voter intimidation."

Reid:  "Some thought it very odd, why they had all the
photographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And
the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.
And another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal
conversation with the American people."


Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Fineman: "He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was
something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made
it worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so
be it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,
after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going
to be hard for most Americans to agree with that...

"...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got
to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.

"...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has..."

	Reforms in India Are Tantalizing,
But Debates Cool Investor Ardor
	By DANNY PEARL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
	NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely 
been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through 
this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets 
has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign 
investors.
	Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a 
plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of 
controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: 
stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open 
battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic 
gambles.
	"The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there 
is no crisis around the corner," says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the 
Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is 
still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year.
	
	Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered 
its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic 
reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of 
Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including Enron Corp. 
of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India 
investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the 
multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they 
were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse.
	Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which 
one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is 
sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But 
what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's 
Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private 
enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional 
Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress 
Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is 
moving in small, often contradictory steps.
	"Their hearts are in the right place," says John Band, executive director of 
ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank.
	Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas.
	Privatization
	India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but 
much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the 
government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees 
($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial 
money losers. The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart, 
Indian Airlines, both of which have attracted expressions of interest from 
foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines. Divestment 
Minister Arun Shourie, who isn't revealing the full list, said on the first 
day of the World Economic Forum's "India Economic Summit" in New Delhi Sunday 
that before proceeding to formal bids, India will reject suitors who could 
pose national-security concerns. India, he said, wants to avoid buyers who 
might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing 
rights.
	Job padding is legendary in India, so fear of job losses is real. Bank 
workers fired a warning shot across privatization's bow this month with a 
one-day, midweek strike against government banks. The next day, the 
government announced it was moving forward anyhow, seeking a law that would 
allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below 50%. The move wasn't as 
bold as it seemed, though: The law wouldn't actually contemplate a sale of 
shares and wouldn't allow any single investor to buy more than 1%. Government 
officials pledged to keep the "public character" of the banks.
	Supporters of divestment within Mr. Vajpayee's cabinet are few but 
influential. They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the 
government's 50% stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd., a joint venture of 
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. and India's government. But the cabinet is divided 
over the sale, and Mr. Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition 
happy, including hardline nationalists. This weekend, Mr. Shourie flew to 
Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about 
the prime minister's recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled 
region of Kashmir. One of their demands, he says, was that "Foreigners should 
not come to acquire control of the Indian economy."
	Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization. The 
World Bank has cited concern that India's budget deficit is a whopping 9.6% 
of its gross domestic product, though much of the red ink can be traced to 
state budgets. Mr. Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy 
believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states 
start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities -- but "that's 
not even being talked about."
	Media
	India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign 
media, especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the 
Kashmir dispute. Technology has brought paradoxes: Indians now get scores of 
channels by cable TV, but only government-controlled TV over regular antenna. 
Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but 
cannot print in India. (The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have 
made informal efforts to lift the barrier.)
	
	The newly appointed information minister, Sushma Swaraj, a BJP hard-liner, 
this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness. At her 
prodding, the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly 
by satellite -- but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership. 
Equally worrisome was Ms. Swaraj's explanation for the government's decision 
to move forward. Before, she explained, the government had no satellite 
facility in India; now it did, and could cut off broadcasts that offend 
India's programming code. Ms. Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web 
sites, too. "They are bound by this code," she said. "As yet there is no 
complaint. If there is, we can take care of it."
	Ms. Swaraj started a "national debate" over whether to lift the restrictions 
on foreign media; 10 days later ended it with a firm 'no.' But as one door 
closes in India, another often cracks open. Private FM radio is expected to 
make its debut in the spring. The government has also taken steps to help 
film studios get expansion financing, just as Hollywood starts to prowl the 
Hindi film industry for investments.
	Telecommunications
	The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of 
telecommunications, and the results may even help build domestic support for 
other reforms. Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service 
improves. In Bombay, which once had five-year waiting lists for new telephone 
lines, the government's local-phone company, MTNL, now promises, even if it 
doesn't always deliver, hookups in two days. The reason is new competition 
from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp.
	Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the country's 
booming software and call-center business relies on fast communications with 
the U.S. The government only recently loosened its control over international 
data gateways, a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data 
traffic jams. Idika Solutions, a software company based in Hyderabad, got in 
the habit of downloading files at 6 a.m. to avoid the rush.
	Further reforms should speed up improvements. Next year, Parliament is 
expected to pass a "convergence" law, allowing telephone, wireless and data 
services to come under the same license. And the following year government 
phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on long-distance phone 
service.
	Trade
	In theory, India, a member of the World Trade Organization, has no choice but 
to open its borders to foreign products, and so far it is sticking to 
schedule, passing a new patents law and so forth. But rather than investing 
to get ready for free competition, many business families are simply getting 
out of manufacturing. Their worry isn't so much luxury goods from the West, 
which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the 
spring, but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia. The 
government is starting to heed the call for more protection: Last week, it 
raised duties on cooking oil and listed 131 imported products that would have 
to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy.
	The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as 
textiles for a world without quotas. Still, the industry is so thoroughly 
regulated that it is hard to see India's mild reforms having much effect. For 
example, the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move 
into certain products that were reserved for small companies, but it still 
requires yarn-spinners to produce 10% of their yarn in a form that can be 
used by obsolete hand looms. With certain fabrics, "if I produce it on a 
power loom, I'm breaking the law," says Ramesh Chander Kesar, president of 
the Textile Association India in New Delhi. "Why should there should be a 
restriction?"
	The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian 
workers, and the government is loath to throw them out on the street. 
Actually, even when mills close, as many have in central Bombay, mill owners 
often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of 
the land.
	"If we can fire a worker for not working, that will send a powerful signal. 
But there are no votes in it," says Gurchuran Das, former Procter & Gamble 
chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party. "Nobody has the 
courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain 
NAFTA: that jobs will be lost but, in the end, jobs will be created."
	Some less courageous moves are possible: one idea under discussion in New 
Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily.
	Finance
	India made some big financial reforms in the early '90s, with liberalization 
of interest rates, loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of 
private banking. The country just needs some more money to prime the system.
	The government is approving new financial products, such as derivatives. The 
big prize, investment bankers say, would be opening of the 
government-controlled mutual fund and pension plans. Right now, they offer 
fixed returns. Private investment companies want the government to let them 
offer Indians more-aggressive private pensions.
	"They are listening," says Raju Panjwani, managing director of Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter India. "Maybe equities are considered risky, but we can't even 
invest in corporate bonds." The government has a plan under study, called 
"Project Oasis," that would allow private pension fund management, with some 
restrictions.
	Another possible source of long-term capital is insurance, something there 
isn't much of in India. The government took a big step last year in allowing 
private insurance companies back into India after nearly 50 years. But as the 
race to start marketing policies begins, only half a dozen companies have 
jumped in. Foreign companies are limited to 26% of each insurance 
partnership. That is a problem, because launching an insurance company can 
take $75 million, and "there are not that many Indian companies that can 
support 74% of that kind of a number," says Gary Benanav, chief executive of 
New York Life Insurance Co.'s international unit. The company, which is 
launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian 
conglomerate, estimates the Indian market could support 50 insurance 
competitors.
	"They've made a decision which I don't think in the long run is in the best 
interests of India, though I understand it. The colonial era has left a few 
wounds here," Mr. Benanav says.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. "I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season," he said. "It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference."

On Monday of this week the number of Financial deals transacted on EOL 
increased by approximately 1000 deals per day.    In addition,
the machine that the faxing process and Sitara runs on was down Tuesday for 
four hours do to a machine failure.

As a result of the increased EOL volumes and the machine downtime, the faxing 
backlog has grown significantly.  Invoices have
the highest priority so they should go out as quickly as before, the confirms 
will take some time.

We have been working on upgrading the hardware the faxing process runs on for 
some time and  have now focused all resources on this task
as a result of the increased EOL volumes.  We have called in additional 
support from the Facsys ( the software that faxes the documents ) reseller.  

It is likely that all confirmations queued to fax today will not reach their 
destination until sometime this weekend.  

Please cqll me at 3-7569 if you have any questions.

Thanks, Ron

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Dixon was suspended for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh for missing a team 
meeting earlier in the week. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the 
season.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Greisen replaced an injured Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's game 
at Jacksonville. The second-year quarterback completed 4-of-7 passes for 46 
yards and a touchdown in his short appearance in the game. With the 
Cardinals' season lost, Greisen could get some serious playing time in 
Arizona's last two games, but he is still not a viable Fantasy option at this 
point in the season.    

 Dave Brown , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown started for the injured Jake Plummer against the Jacksonville Jaguars 
on Sunday. He was ineffective for the most part, throwing for only 135 yards 
and an interception before leaving the game with a bruised right index 
finger. Whether it is Plummer, Brown or Chris Greisen under center for 
Arizona next week, it is imperative to avoid any Cardinals' quarterback at 
this point in the season.      

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Plummer, still suffering from bruised ribs, missed Sunday's game against the 
Jaguars. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Dave Brown. The Cardinals 
face off against the Ravens and their top-rated defense next week, so even if 
Plummer is healthy, he shouldn't be considered a starter for your Fantasy 
team.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 McNabb was brilliant in Sunday's blowout win over the Browns.  He threw for 
390 yards and four touchdowns, proving that he is not strictly a running 
quarterback. It was one of McNabb's best all-around performances, and it 
likely helped many Fantasy owners advance in their league's playoffs. 
Unfortunately for those same owners, McNabb and the Eagles have a late season 
bye next week, so you will need to look elsewhere for a quarterback in your 
quest for the Fantasy championship.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Seahawks' defense lost three players to injury in Sunday's loss to the 
Broncos. Safety Jay Bellamy (lower back cramps), defensive end Lamar King 
(shoulder) and defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy (thumb) all left the game with 
various injuries. At this point of the Fantasy season, you should avoid 
starting the Seahawks' defense at all costs.    

 Jets , DT NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jets' defense put up a good fight against the Raiders on Sunday night, 
but were hurt by turnovers which kept them on the field for a good portion of 
the game. The 31 points they gave up to Oakland was only one more than the 
total points they had allowed in the previous three weeks. Expect a better 
performance next week against the Lions - especially if the weather is cold 
at the Meadowlands. On the injury front, defensive lineman Rick Lyle broke 
his leg against the Raiders and will be lost for the season.     

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.

You cannot pickup players in the playoffs.  That defeats the whole purpose of

**************************** November 20, 2000  ************************

As sure as each hour brings a new court decision =01( as sure cranberry sal=
es
peak in November =01( Thanksgiving surprise fares appear. We=01,re sending =
out
this special edition e-mail to give you a jump on these new deals. Plus,
in (festive) light of our new, lower Turkey Day fares and the short
workweek, we decided to release our Hot Deals By E-mail today and on
Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to
travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from
Uncle Ed=01,s snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of =
a
two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving
Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares
are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to
1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also
offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun,
Grand Cayman, Montego Bay and St. Maarten with discounts reaching 60
percent for travel through June 15, 2001. If you=01,re going to be travelin=
g
and unable to check your e-mail, why not ask a family member at your
destination to sign up for a free Hot Deals subscription, so you can check
the latest-breaking deals from their computers? Just tell them Tom Parsons
will be talking turkey on low-fare travel.

THANKSGIVING FARES $64 TO $189 RT THROUGHOUT 48 STATES.
With airfares as low as $64 roundtrip, Thanksgiving travel is within the
reach of almost everyone. If you=01,re having the traditional family dinner
at home, here=01,s your opportunity to bring in a few more family members o=
r
friends to make the day more memorable. Or, surprise your family with a
short (and sweet) visit. In some cases, you can deliver yourself for
little more than what an FTD holiday bouquet would cost. A quick trip can
also provide a chance for some great Friday shopping. Head to New York
City for Macy=01,s Thanksgiving Day Parade and check out the festive store
windows. Visit the gigantic Mall of America in Minneapolis, Rodeo Drive in
Beverly Hills or the Dallas Galleria. To qualify for these super low
fares, you must depart on Thanksgiving Day and be on a return flight no
later than midnight Friday, November 25. One other important plus with
this special is that we can waive the standard $40 roundtrip fuel
surcharge. How cheap are these two-day stay fares? How about Dallas/Fort
Worth to San Diego or Los Angeles for $135 roundtrip? You can fly from
Chicago to New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Atlanta for
$103 roundtrip. Fly from San Francisco to Minneapolis, Oklahoma City or
San Antonio for $151 roundtrip. Denver to Dallas/Fort Worth, Kansas City
or Des Moines is $103 roundtrip. Washington (DC) to Cleveland, Detroit,
Pittsburgh or Charlotte is $99 roundtrip. Atlanta to Indianapolis,
Louisville, Dayton or Columbus (OH) is $79 roundtrip. Check out our
last-minute Turkey Day fares at

COMING WEDNESDAY: 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES ON SALE FROM $328 RT.
We are very close to posting new roundtrip fares for travel through June
15, 2001 to 15 cities in the Caribbean. As winter arrives and temperatures
drop, so will our airfares. If you think peak season travel to sunny
destinations is prohibitive, take a peek at these bargains. Depart from
your choice of over 40 U.S. cities to Caribbean destinations such as San
Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, St. Croix, Nassau, Montego Bay, Grand
Cayman and many others starting at just $328 roundtrip. For example, from
Atlanta to St. Thomas, the peak winter rate is  $718 roundtrip. Our fare
is only $328. Boston to Cancun is priced at $818 roundtrip, but we can get
you there for $328, saving you almost $500 per ticket.  Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego or Seattle to St. Maarten or St. Thomas sells for
$986. Our new low fare is $468. Get read for our Wednesday e-mail and its
full-blown thaw-out sale, then prepare to bask in the warmth of a
beautiful Caribbean island with 85-degree temperatures. When these fares
are released, please act fast. We don=01,t want you to be left out in the
cold. Airfares this low, with a limited inventory, will sell out in a
hurry. Pump up your tropical travel with a few more details at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10107781

TWO MORE DAYS: DOWN UNDER UP FOR GRABS AT UP TO $700 OFF.

roundtrip or more and be Bestfares.com bound for Down Under for as little
as $838. We have a wide selection of 53 U.S. departure cities to get you
on your way Melbourne or Sydney, Australia or Auckland, New Zealand from

Australia.

Good Morning!

I wanted to let each of you know that I had no problem collecting sufficient 
performance data to present you to the Corporate PRC on Wednesday.  After the 
meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.

 "Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, "What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?"  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  "Little Hitlers," they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, "Heil
Hitler" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those "littlest" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

Subject: Practice - TONIGHT


Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

1
Statement by Governor George W. Bush
November 22, 2000

"I am disappointed with last night's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court.  We 
believe the justices have used the bench to change Florida's election laws 
and usurp the authority of Florida's election officials.  We believe the 
court overreached. Writing laws is the duty of the legislature; administering 
laws is the duty of the executive branch.

"Two weeks after the presidential election, a court has decided that
Florida's deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a
deadline at all. The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes 
that have already been counted at least two times, and in some cases three or 
four times, will continue more than a week after the law says it should. And 
the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this.

"The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language. But make no
mistake, the court rewrote the law. It changed the rules, and it did so after 
the election was over.

Statement by James Baker III, Senior Advisor, Bush-Cheney Recount

"At Monday's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court,
Justice Harding asked a key question about Florida's electoral
laws and standards: "Is it right to change the rules in the
middle of the game?"

"The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral
boards have now decided to do just that.

Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count
Dimpled Ballots, So...

 ~ For the past week, the Gore campaign has been saying that
   the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of
   this election.  But now that they didn't get a decision
   exactly to their liking, the Gore campaign is backpedaling
   and saying that they will leave all their options open.

 ~ In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be
   counted as votes, the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke
   case in Illinois, but the Illinois case didn't talk about
   dimpled chads at all. It involved hanging chads, the
   standard that these three counties began using and the
   standard that they are now seeking to change.

 ~ There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas
   governing manual recounts.  In Texas this would all be over
   because Texas only allows one manual recount, and it has
   very clear and objective standards.  The first of those is
   when you see light coming through, and the second of those
   is where you have a hanging chad. It's only in the third
   instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any
   consideration of a dimpled chad, and it doesn't say that a
   dimpled chad can be considered standing alone. It says it
   can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a
   clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote.

 ~ With its decision, the Florida Supreme Court has decided
   to 'change the rules in the middle of the game.'

 ~ The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both
   the executive and legislative branches.  They effectively
   rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida
   Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly
   belonged to the Florida Secretary of State.

 ~ This decision by seven Democrat justices completely
   politicizes the vote-counting process by putting the fate
   of this election in the hands of the six Democrats, two
   independents and only one Republican that control the
   Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this
   election, the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the
   rules in three counties that are still conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ Statistical experts have said that under the current
   standards, Gore will not get enough votes to overcome
   Governor Bush's lead.  So now the Gore campaign is looking
   to change those standards in the middle of the process.

 ~ The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a
   slight indentation.  No hole in the ballot is necessary.
   No single loose corner is necessary.  Not even seeing any
   light through the ballot is necessary.  This lenient
   standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent
   enough votes to overturn the election.

 ~ Ten years ago, the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in
   Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots
   should be counted that stated, "But a chad that is fully
   attached, bearing only an indentation, should not be
   counted as a vote."  Now Democrats want to unfairly change
   those rules.

 ~ The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes
   they need is to keep changing the rules.  This is unfair
   and unacceptable.  This election must be decided by the
   rules that existed on Election Day, not the rules
   rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged
   environment two weeks later.

The Washington Post
SEND IN THE THUGS
Michael Kelly
11/22/00

Excerpt:
"Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida, he will have come
very, very close to winning. Moreover, he will have done this
with his image-skin more or less intact. For Gore has already
won an astonishing propaganda victory: With the help of
reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and
liberal national press corps, he has managed to spin his
extraordinary, radical, unprecedented behavior as reasonable -
and legitimate. This probably ensures that future close
presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers,
marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies
of lawyers and thugs, demanding recounts, rewriting the rules
and the laws, convincing more and more Americans that their
electoral system is, like those in most of the world, just
another rigged game.

Thanks, Al, we needed that."

The Palm Beach Post
Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996
Joel Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post
11/22/00

Excerpts:
"Amid the swarm of the world press outside the county Emergency
Operations Center, Dennis Newman leads the charge to find new
votes for Al Gore in the dimples of the Palm Beach County
ballot.

"His argument, put simply, is that dimples show the true intent
of the voter. Voters caused those dimples. Dimples should count.

"Four years ago, in a similar election spat, Newman took a much
different stand. Employing his best legal tactics on behalf of
a Democrat holding a slight lead in a primary race for
Congress, Newman scoffed at the idea of counting the tiny
indentations as votes.

"Like the Republicans watching now, Newman wondered out loud how
ballots that had been handled over and over, in recount after
recount, could still be impartially judged. Couldn't the
ballots -- and therefore the votes -- be affected by all that
touching and grabbing?

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - FIBSABs Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.

I'm sure you're aware but wanted to forward the latest from ESPN.com

Faulk To Undergo Knee Surgery
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1105/860356.html  From the article:  St.
Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove
loose cartilage from his right knee, an injury that forced him out of Sunday
night's loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Faulk practiced Friday and went out for (pregame) warmups after having the
knee drained earlier Sunday, but the knee began to lock on him. Coach Mike
Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only 2-3 weeks. But
teammate D'Marco Farr, a defensive tackle, was out a month with a similar
operation.

"He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there," Martz said. "Really,
there was nothing else to do."

Justin Watson started in place of Faulk, who leads the NFL with 1,326 yards
from scrimmage. Faulk suited up for the first half, but was wearing sweats
after the break.
Watson scored on a 3-yard run in the third quarter, but finished with 12
yards on 12 carries.

Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season. An MRI on Monday
also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the
loose cartilage.

My View:   Coach Mike Martz called him "Superman" last week as he battled
through injuries.  Apparently, he's mortal after all.  The surgery to remove
the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in 2-3
weeks.  If you started Faulk, don't be kicking yourself.  There was nothing
you or anyone else could have done.  As of late Sunday afternoon / evening,
he was still the starter.  You can't control last minute scratches when a
player has a problem during pregame warm-ups.  All Faulk owners knew he
wasn't 100% but we all know he's still one of the best RBs in the game even
when dinged up.  Hindsight is 20 / 20. Let it go.

All you can do is move forward.  Let's look at it analytically:

The problem now becomes a matter of timing.  If Faulk comes back according
to schedule, he'll be ready in week 13 or 14.   Most FF leagues play a 14
game regular season with playoffs in weeks 15 and 16 (or 17 if your league
hasn't wised up yet)  This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season
but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs.

For Teams that own Faulk:  As we predicted, Justin Watson carried the load
for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with 12 yards on 12 carries, although
he did get the TD.  I'd think he'll improve but it's obvious Faulk, not just
the system, is the driving force behind his success.  What I'm saying is
that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George
stepping in.  Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate (if
he ever sheds the candybone label) or Robert Holcombe.  A better option
might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well
right now like Chicago's James Allen, Buffalo's Sammy Morris or J.R. Redmond
in New England.  If you've got a playoff spot secured, don't panic.  Grab a
lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs, keeping
your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery.  If you need a big push
just to make the playoffs, I'd think very hard about dealing Faulk and
shoring up your short term needs.  You have to remember, you've got to MAKE
the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl.

For Teams who don't own Faulk:  The question you must ask yourself is do you
have depth somewhere that you'd be willing to trade away for Faulk?  If you
seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs, it might be a great move.  In other
words, you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be
a bench player for you over the next few weeks. In turn, you get Faulk back
just in time for your playoff push.  But you're banking on #1 Making the
playoffs and #2 Faulk being ready by week 14.  Only you can judge your
chances for #1 but from all I'm hearing, #2 seems pretty darn likely.  If
you've got the playoffs spot sewn up, it could be a great move to trade for
Faulk now.  Don't give up too much.  Don't hesitate to let the Faulk owner
know that teammate D'Marco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar
injury and we all know a RB's knee takes much more stress with the cutting
that does a Defensive Tackle's.  Throw in some comments about St. Louis
resting Faulk for the playoffs.

Speaking of the "resting for the playoff" factor - You have to look at how
well the Saints are playing.  The Super Bowl  champs are in real danger of
not even winning their own division.  It looks like St. Louis will be
battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility, the
Rams resting all their players doesn't seem as likely as it did a month ago.
Another reason you shouldn't give up too much in trading for Faulk.  Make
sure to "sell" your position either way based on whether you're a Faulk
owner or not.  If you're trading him away, you want to talk up the Saints
and the tough scenarios if St. Louis loses again (the hot Giants are next on
the road).  St. Louis will be fighting for their lives you'll say.  If
you're dealing for Faulk, obviously, you'll take the other side of the fence
and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the
postseason.

The truth, in my opinion, lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed
back into service for the regular season.  Assuming the surgery / rehab goes
well of course.  Faulk's one of the tougher guys in the league, so I have no
reason to believe he won't make a normal recovery.

Bottom line is look at this situation going forward.  You can't do anything
about what's happened.  Make it work to your advantage over the next few
weeks.  Good luck!

I'll see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade Player Report.

Joe

I received this email and wanted to share the photo.

Beautiful but sad.

This awsome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska  by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he
was working  while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it
so he  should  at  least be recognized as the photographer of this once
in a lifetime shot.

Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see the matchups  this week.? Please=
=20
note, see  thecheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm?=
 =20
for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.????

Locks:? These games heavily  favor the Offense??

Jamal Anderson (Atl) vs Seahawk  Defense?  If you=01,ve learned  anything t=
his=20
season, it=01,s start RBs facing the Seahawk defense.? Fo the year, they ra=
nk #=20
26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Over the last four week=
s,=20
they=01,ve really tailed off ranking # 31 in  rushing yards allowed per gam=
e.? =20
They=01,re playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a  statement.



Warrick Dunn (TB) vs Cowboy  Defense?? The Cowboys haven=01,t gotten any  b=
etter=20
against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear.? Over the last=
=20
four weeks, they rank # 30  in rushing yards allowed per game.?  For the=20
year, they=01,re ranked # 30 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RBs=
.?=20
Dunn=01,s athletic style  will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner d=
id=20
earlier the season.???

Fred Taylor (Jac) vs Brown  Defense?? Cleveland struggles against most  any=
=20
RB but especially tough, physical rushing teams.? Taylor and the Jaguars fi=
t=20
that  bill.? This season has seen some  rushing performances of historical=
=20
significance this year.? You might see another one this  week.? On paper, i=
t=01,
s a dream  matchup.???

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak)  vs Steeler Defense?? I know it=01,s hard to believe =
but =20
the numbers show that over the past four weeks, Pittsburgh ranks # 28 in=20
rushing  yards allowed per game.? They=01,re  allowing 171 yards rushing on=
 the=20
ground.?  Granted, Fred Taylor, Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into=
=20
that  number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isn=01,t too far down below thei=
r=20
class.? He=01,s healthier now than he has been in a  while.



Ricky Watters (Sea) vs Falcon  Defense?? I=01,ve been a Ricky Watters fan  =
since=20
the 49er days.? One of the  best combinations of rushing and receiving in=
=20
some time.? He=01,s had an age defying season and the  roll should continue=
=20
against a Falcon unit that=01,s been awful defending the run  lately.? For =
the=20
last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed per game.? For th=
e=20
year, they=01,re # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.??  Eve=
ryone=20
keeps wondering  when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets=
=20
blown out here (which  I have hard time seeing) I think you=01,ll see plent=
y of=20
Ricky  Watters.?

Corey Dillon (Cin) vs  Cardinal Defense?? Like Fred Taylor vs. Cleveland, =
=20
this one looks almost too good to be true on paper.? They don=01,t always t=
urn=20
out that way in  reality but you=01,ve got to be drooling over this game if=
 you=01,
re a Dillon  owner.? His running in the lack of a  real passing game threat=
=20
is an amazing feat.? Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be  effective=20
throwing the ball which will help even more.

?

?

Prime  Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense??

Tony  Richardson / Kimble Anders (KC)? vs  Patriot Defense??  Our support o=
f=20
Christian Okoye  last week for a Chief RB didn=01,t garner much support fro=
m the=20
KC coaching staff  so it looks like another week of Richardson / Anders.?=
=20
Anders actually got plenty of carries  last week and promptly did very litt=
le=20
with them. Richardson appears to be the  better back right now but who know=
s=20
how this will play out.? It=01,s hard for me to advocate  either.? But if y=
ou do=20
go with one,  know that they=01,ll be facing a pretty soft New England rush=
=20
defense that ranks #  25 in rushing yards allowed per gameover the  last fo=
ur=20
weeks.?

Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Brad Hoover (Car) vs Rams  Defense??? Biakabutuka=
=20
found there was  no rehabilitation method quite as effective as 60,000 folk=
s=20
chanting  =01&Hoooooo-ver=018 on Monday night=01(?  Amazing how that consis=
tently=20
works.? Biakabutuka has been upgraded to  probable but I=01,m not convinced=
=20
Hoover just takes his place back on the  bench.? You=01,ll likely see both =
 go.?=20
The Rams still give up a good  bit of yardage on the ground lately averagin=
g=20
127 yards per game over the last  four weeks.? That ranks them #  24.? For=
=20
the year, they rank # 23  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.???

J.R.  Redmond (NE) vs Chief Defense?? The Patriots are a tough team to =20
figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg =
=20
rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny.? But if he can hold them=
=20
together, I=01,ve  got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here.? Th=
e=20
Chiefs rank # 23 over the past four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per gam=
e.
? For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  R=
B.
?  Keep  an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he can=01,t go, all bets are off b=
ut if=20
he can keep  the defense honest, I like Redmond=01,s chances here.? Of cour=
se,=20
you have to know the risks  that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick=
=20
Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments  notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong =
=20
way=01(



Edgerrin James (Ind) vs  Jets Defense?? The NFL is the ultimate game of =20
watching to see what others do.? You  can bet the Colts are aware of the=20
success Chicago=01,s James Allen had last week  rushing (and fumbling) the =
ball=20
against New York.? I think you=01,ll see a steady diet of  Edgerrin doing t=
he=20
same thing (hopefully not fumbling though)? James is a no brainer =01) star=
t=20
him  against virtually any team unless you=01,re so loaded at RB it=01,s no=
t =20
fair.?

Eddie George (Ten) vs  Eagle Defense?? Philadelphia isn=01,t quite as tough=
  vs=20
the run as their reputation might have you believe.? Over the last four=20
weeks, they rank # 21  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? For the  year,=
=20
they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.? But you  can=
=20
pretty much throw those numbers out when it=01,s Eddie George.? He=01,ll ge=
t his=20
yards the hard way.? I=01,d be very surprised if you don=01,t see  George e=
xhibit=20
some leadership here and put together a solid  effort.



Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Colts  Defense?? It sounds like Curtis Martin is  ju=
st=20
going to have to play with the strained buttocks.? (you=01,ve heard enough =
jokes=20
by now, I=01,ll  spare you)? The Indy defense is  definitely vulnerable to =
the=20
rush.?  For the season, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the=20
opposing  RBs.? This game will be in New York  and the Colts are soft when =
it=01,
s cold outside so Martin could have an  edge.?

James Allen (Chi) vs Green  Bay?? Let=01,s give Allen the benefit of  the d=
oubt=20
and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced.? (although I didn=01,t =
see=20
Curtis Martin  fumble three times and he was there too=01()?  If he can fin=
d the=20
handle on the ball, he=01,ll be fine as he actually ran  very while when he=
=20
managed to hang on to the football.? Green Bay proved Monday night they can=
=01,
t  stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears=
=20
and for  Allen.

??

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way?

Travis Prentice / Jamel White (Cle) vs  Jaguar Defense??  This is one of =
=20
those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper.?=20
Jacksonville has yielded an average of  120 yards rushing per game over the=
=20
last four weeks.? That ranks them # 20.? They also rank # 20 for the year i=
n =20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs.? But they=01,re playing better =
than=20
that now  I believe.? And the Browns are just  playing out the season.? And=
=20
the  bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel=
=20
White has  looked impressive.? It=01,s a decent  matchup for Cleveland but =
I=01,d=20
probably shy from these guys if it were  me.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense?? A case of both sides being bette=
r =20
than what many people think.?  Michael Pittman is a player.?  Since Vince=
=20
Tobin left, it=01,s been pretty much Pittman=01,s show on the  ground much =
to the=20
chagrin of Thomas Jones owners.? And on the other side of the ball, the =20
Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for.? On the ground, they=
=20
rank # 17 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? For=
=20
the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  S=
o=20
this once could truly go either way.? I=01,d feel ok with Pittman if he was=
 my =20
guy but I wouldn=01,t be overly excited.?

Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense?? This isn=01,t the best matchup in the=
 =20
world for Smith but you have to start him.?  If nothing else than to get an=
=20
early lead on your opponent with a  Thursday night game.? C=01,mon, that=01=
,s =20
worth something=01(? Seriously, Smith  is one of the elite RBs right now bu=
t=20
Detroit is playing pretty tough against  the run ranking # 15 in rushing=20
yards allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? He=01,s a starter though=
,=20
just  play him.?

Ahman Green (GB) vs Bear  Defense?? Find a nice toasty place to watch  this=
=20
one.? Chicago in December.? At night.? That=01,s football.? With Dorsey Lev=
ens=20
likely gone for the  year, the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man.?=
=20
Chicago has a tough run defense led by  all world rookie Brian Urlacher.? I=
 =20
told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him =01&Vanilla=
=20
Freak=018  and now you=01,re seeing why.? I love  this kid.? These guys are=
 =20
professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy=
=20
with  the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature=20
keeps  dropping.???

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Bills  Defense? Smith practiced Wednesday and while it=
=01,
s  awful early to make a definitive call, it looks like he=01,ll start Sund=
ay.?=20
The Bufallo defense is solid against the  rush.? They rank # 13 in rushing =
=20
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? Although for the year, th=
ey=20
rank # 5 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.?  Although if Smith=
=20
can return to his awesome form before the injury, he=01,ll  be a load.? The=
=20
Dolphins will rely  on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus=
=20
not that good to begin  with.?

Marshall Faulk (StL) vs Panther  Defense?? Let=01,s hope Faulk gets back to=
 his =20
old form.? And let=01,s hope the  Panther defense gets back more their old=
=20
rushing defense form.? Over the last four games, Carolina ranks  # 12 in=20
rushing yards allowed per game.?  But for the year, they come in at # 25 in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB.? It sounds to me like  coach Mi=
ke=20
Martz won=01,t make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best  we=
apons=20
in Faulk.

??

Downside Matchups:? These  games favor the Defense?

Shawn Bryson / Sammy Morris / Antowain  Smith (Buf) vs Miami Defense??=20
Believe it or not, the Dolphin  Defense ranks just # 16 in rushing yards=20
allowed per game over the last four  weeks.? Granted, 3 of those games  don=
=01,t=20
factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have =
=20
thought.? The Bills rushing game is  a mess.? The team is calling Morris=01=
, =20
ankle questionable so we=01,ll have to wait and see.? Bryson has done very=
=20
little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn=01,t produce or we woul=
d=20
have never seen so much  of Bryson and Morris.? With a  healthy Zach Thomas=
,=20
I=01,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.????

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense?? Emmitt Smith said he=01,d never =
been =20
knocked out in his career but that=01,s what happened Thursday.? He=01,s bo=
unced=20
back quickly and says he=01,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.?  The Bucs=
 are=20
tough but not invincible.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in=20
rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.?=
=20
Emmitt=01,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his=
=20
career so I=01,m not overly  concerned with the matchup.? He=01,s a  gamer =
and I=01,d=20
say he=01,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa=
 Bay.



Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense??  Be very leery  here.? Stephen Dav=
is=20
demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of=
=20
salt.? Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recoveri=
ng=20
from injury.?  Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I w=
as=20
sure he=01,d  start, I=01,d think very hard about going elsewhere this week=
.? It=01,s=20
not like he=01,s facing Seattle and  this is a dream matchup or something.?=
  The=20
Giants are tough against the run ranking # 2 for the year in Fantasy  Point=
s=20
allowed to the opposing RB. ?So unless you know for sure he=01,s going,  I=
=01,d=20
strongly consider my other options.?

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense?? Fletcher is probable with a rib =
=20
fracture which must sound worse than it is.? Either that or he=01,s one tou=
gh=20
guy.? The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense=
=20
lately.?  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushi=
ng=20
yards  allowed per game.? That=01,s a marked  contrast to their year long=
=20
numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.=
?=20
Adding  Fletcher=01,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don=01,t see much fro=
m San=20
Diego on the  ground Sunday.?

Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins??  To me, Barber is  looking muc=
h=20
more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don=01,t see  New=
 York=20
taking a lead where they can grind out the clock.? If you=01,re a Dayne own=
er,=20
you=01,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in=
=20
favor of Barber  when his team trails.? The Giants  are a good team but I d=
on=01,
t see them jumping all over Washington.? Plus, the Redskins play very good=
=20
rush  defense.? For the year, they rank #  4 in Fantasy Points allowed to t=
he=20
opposing RB and over the last four weeks,  they rank # 8 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed per game.???

James Stewart (Det) vs Viking  Defense?? Stewart=01,s great game against Ta=
mpa =20
Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but he=01,s go=
t a =20
surprisingly tough situation here.?  Minnesota over the last four weeks ran=
ks=20
# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? For the year, they rank # 14  in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.? Part of that has to do with the=
=20
Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up=
=20
but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there.? LB Dwayne Rud=
d=20
should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I=01,m=
=20
still not overly excited about the  matchup.? Still though, Stewart is  one=
=20
of the better backs and I=01,d think he=01,s likely a starter for your team=
 unless =20
you=01,re loaded with RBs.

?

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense?

Darnell  Autry / Stanley Pritchett (Phi) vs Titan Defense??  The Eagle RBs=
=20
have been very little factor and I don=01,t see them all of a  sudden emerg=
ing=20
against a very tough Tennessee defense.? Especially one in a foul mood afte=
r =20
another last second loss from the kicker.?  It=01,s a tough job, but QB Don=
ovan=20
McNabb carries this team almost solely  on his shoulders.? He could be the =
=20
teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs.? For th=
e=20
year, the Titans rank # 6  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.??=
?

Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense?? I like Mike Anderson and he=01,s a=
 =20
great story but he=01,s got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans=
.?=20
The Saints rank # 3 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing=
=20
RB and over the last four games, they  rank # 5 in rushing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game.? They=01,ve just averaged 81 yards per game  allowed rushing.? Anders=
on is=20
still  probably worth a start unless you=01,re really deep at RB but just b=
e=20
aware he=01,s  facing a tough defense.?

Charlie Garner (SF) vs Charger  Defense?? With a week off to prepare, Garne=
r =20
comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first =20
victory.? They=01,re playing rush  defense like we=01,re accustomed to seei=
ng from=20
San Diego ranking # 4 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four=
=20
weeks.? Garner isn=01,t your normal back but he=01,s  facing a tough game h=
ere.? I=01,
d still  start him as he=01,s got that big play potential with the ability =
to go=20
the  distance at any time, but I=01,m not excited about the  matchup.?

Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense?? Jerome Bettis was built for =20
grinding down defenses in the December cold but he=01,ll have a tough match=
up=20
this  week against Oakland.? The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks=
=20
in rushing yards allowed per game.? That=01,s partly why their passing defe=
nse =20
is so bad: teams can=01,t run so they go to the air.? I like Bettis and I t=
hink=20
he=01,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a=20
difficult matchup  here.?

Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense?? Assuming Moore is ok=
=20
with his neck  stinger, he=01,ll be running behind his outstanding OL but t=
his=20
is a tough matchup  against the Denver Defense that=01,s remained tough vs =
the=20
run.? Over the last four weeks, they rank # 3  in rushing yards allowed per=
=20
game allowing an average of 74 yards per game.? Ricky Watters and Seattle=
=20
only managed  to post 85 against them Sunday.?  Moore looks to get the=20
majority of carries and goalline work so he=01,s the  better option at this=
=20
point assuming he can go.? But even healthy, he=01,s got his work cut  out =
for=20
him.

We got another big name recruit - that will probably amount to nothing with 
our conservative, shitty Offensive Coordinator.

European Travel Tip
?

When travelling to the U.K. with your hair dryer, electric shaver,  etc., 
don't forget to buy an adapter to fit in the U.K. sockets  before you leave 
home - or at latest in the airport upon arrival.  You are unlikely to find 
these adapters commonly available anywhere  else in the U.K. Adapters are 
available in all electrical shops,  but these are for U.K. appliances to fit 
non U.K. sockets, i.e.,  for when U.K. citizens are travelling outside of the 
U.K. Don't  forget that U.K. voltage is 240 volts - it will fry your 110 
volt  appliance without the correct transforming adapter. -Old Mill Private  
Hotel 

If you have any great travel tips, stories, or photos send them  to me and 
you might just  see your name in the next issue of Here's The Deal!

Once--in March, in Riadosa, NM.  People were literally skiing in tank tops
and shorts.  I heard the slopes at ski apache, where I went, is about 10
times easier than Colorado slopes.  Needless to say, I'm a little nervous
about how well I will do.  But I am extremely excited about going.  When I
did ski before, I was the one in the ski school that everyone was waiting on
because I kept falling, but before I left I made it down all the blues
successfully and one black semi-successfully.  My biggest fear of all is the
cold.  I HATE COLD WEATHER!!  It should be interesting.  On top of it, I'm
extremely excited becase this will be my first vacation I have EVER taken.
Yipppeee!!!

Ladies & Gentlemen,

The BCS may have screwed up the match ups but that won't stop the annual 
College Bowl Pool from taking place.  The attached spreadsheet contains the

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

This is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to 
downtown and near greenville - another bar area).  Might be a little more 
expensive but probably worth it.

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

=09Ivan Williams =20
=09
=09Q: Last year, the coaches raved about Ivan Williams and almost took off =
his=20
redshirt. Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time =
at=20
tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could us=
e=20
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20
=09?? Bob Nance=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=
=20
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =
he=20
was running tentatively.=20
=09
=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =
loose=20
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=
=20
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =
do=20
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=
ds=20
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=
=20
yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this=
=20
week. Should be a good passing game, though.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli=
ng on=20
offense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Gre=
g=20
Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?=20
=09?? Reggie Reeves=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=
=20
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =
is=20
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game=
=20
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr=
om=20
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20
=09
=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=
=20
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=
=20
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=
=20
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=
=20
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.
=09
=09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf=
f in=20
the near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Gre=
g=20
Davis.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=
t=20
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=
=20
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=
=20
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=
on=20
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =
is=20
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=
ht=20
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20
=09
=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =
going=20
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=
ey=20
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=
=20
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=
=20
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=
=20
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20
=09?? Larry, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=
own=20
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=
=20
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=
o=20
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=
=20
=09
=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=
een=20
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=
=20
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=
=20
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=
er=20
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=
=20
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=
=20
however, may be too late against a good team.=20
=09
=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=
o=20
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=
=20
Quye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore=20
(Derrick Dockery). =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the=
=20
off-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impress=
ed=20
with the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning=
=20
why Chris is not playing more than he is?=20
=09?? Jeff Weaver, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But player=
s=20
have not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake a=
nd=20
would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and=
=20
Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20
=09
=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=
e=20
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=
=20
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=
=20
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20
Johnson, the safer choice. "It was the smarter thing to do," he said.=20
=09
=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=
me as=20
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=
ll=20
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=
es=20
have tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.=20

=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is=
=20
having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum=
s=20
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=
at=20
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20
=09 ?? A "Major" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=
=20
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20
=09
=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=
=20
allowed to =20
=09
=09compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet=
her=20
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20
=09
=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =
a=20
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=
=20
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=
7=20
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=
=20
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20
Simms can do.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20
=09?? Sara McFadden=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=
is=20
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=
e=20
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20
=09
=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=
 It=20
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=
=20
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being "the=
=20
man" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=
=20
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=
=20
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20
=09
=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=
=20
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=
d=20
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=
h=20
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=
e=20
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=
 7=20
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in=
=20
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =
to=20
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20
=09
=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=
owed=20
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=
e=20
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=
ll=20
season long. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the=
=20
offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they=
=20
simply being outplayed? =20
=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that th=
ey=20
have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack=
=20
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=
=20
schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20
=09
=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =
UT,=20
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=
=20
Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to =
UT=20
personnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the=
=20
season, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't=
=20
seen. The excuses are running out.=20

=09
=09 Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and=

there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an o=

n=20
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20
=09
=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical "scat-back=
,"=20
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=

quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.=
=20
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20

bad? There has to be more to the story.=20
=09?? Roy Cassas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing h=

to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards=

rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (i=

the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing=20
Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the ru=
n.=20
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149=

citing fans as "... being negative and openly critical ..." (i.e., four=20
losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=

Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites=
=20
the team's emotional psyche as "... being fragile," yet Coach Brown fueled=
=20
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=
=20
=09
=09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's=
=20
mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbule=

os in=20
that one!) during the 1980s? =20
=09?? David Newburn=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=
 help=20
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=
=20
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=
s=20
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=
e=20
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I=
=20
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=
=20
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=
=20
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=
=20
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=
=20
Stanford).=20
=09
=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=
=20
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=
n=20
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=
=20
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the=
=20
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.=20
=09
=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=
s 10=20
penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question =
he=20
is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.=
=20
When his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he=

The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=

why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=

Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20
=09
=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=
he=20
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=

his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=

=20
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20
=09
=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=

There are some conflicts with the draft date, so we will probably need to 
have it on a different date.  Please tell me if you prefer 9/2 ( the day 
before the season starts) or 8/20.  We could also do it during the week, but 
it will probably takle 3 or 4 hrs.

Let me know suggestions.

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

Congratulations Election Integrity 2000 Users. In just
over 24 hours we have collected 100,000 signed letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede. But let's not stop
there!

We need to put more pressure on Al Gore. Below is an
e-mail that can forwarded to all of your friends and
relatives -- anyone who is interested in preserving
the integrity of this election.

Spread the Word!

============================================================

Dear Friend,

Al Gore is flatly refusing to accept the fair and just
election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a calculated
course of action intended to overturn the will of the voters
and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in these
actions are his attempts to attack and discredit military
absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while simultaneously
using manipulative "hand-counting" techniques to convert
so-called "dimpled chads" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers
an overwhelming majority of American citizens.

In order to make this point clear to Mr. Gore, Election
Integrity 2000 is collecting online letters to send to Al
Gore urging him to concede the election NOW!

Please go to http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/g349.cfm
 to sign your letter to Al Gore right now.

Al Gore always claims to be "listening to the will of the
people."  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

PLEASE forward this urgent e-mail to every friend who might
be interested in sending a message to Al Gore that America
wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Today, a Florida judge supported FL Secretary of State Katherine
Harris' decision to reject hand-counted votes submitted after
the November 14 statewide county certification deadline.  The
judge, a Democrat, found Harris had exercised proper discretion.

Governor Bush believes the way to conclude this election, in a
fair, accurate and final way, is for the state of Florida to
count the remaining overseas ballots, add them to the certified
vote, and announce the results, as required by Florida law.

Florida citizens are ready for and will accept this result,
according to two new polls.

According to a new Mason-Dixon poll,  71% of Floridians believe
waiting to declare a winner by the end of this weekend is
ACCEPTABLE, while 60% believe waiting several weeks to declare
a winner is TOO LONG TO WAIT.

Furthermore, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll, 81% will accept
George W. Bush as winner based on the overseas absentee ballots
count plus the current machine tally.

-------------------

Meanwhile, the Gore campaign says they want a full, fair and
accurate count, but today, the LA Times reports on how they
hope to achieve their real objectives...

SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA
excerpts from The Los Angeles Times:

"To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort
Lauderdale with tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are
used to keeping wafflers in line and to count and recount
votes until they know exactly what it will take to outdo their
opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue...

"Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of
AFL-CIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago,
Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco and elsewhere had
disembarked to learn how to observe the ballot count.

"'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new
charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.'  The volunteers
nodded. 'It's very, very important that if you see any kind of
mark--a scratch, a dent, a pinprick in Al Gore's column--that
you challenge.'   When someone then asked what they should do
if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer said:
'Keep your lips sealed.'  It was hardball that the Bostonians
and other imported pros understood well."

In case you haven't heard, New Orleans Saints RB  Ricky Williams suffered a 
broken ankle today and is expected to miss 6-8 weeks  which for most Fantasy 
GMs means he's done for the year.
?
Chat Morton is the rookie from USC who filled in  for Williams. But he's 
short (5' 8" and light 187#)? and I don't think this  is a situation like 
Denver where the backup RB will step in and perform almost  as well as the 
starter.? 
?
Just wanted to give you a headsup as I know many  leagues have a first come 
first serve policy for distributing free  agents.
?
More Monday.

Well,

I'm  back.  JRTC was a helluva lot better than I thought it would be.  It
was a month long, and though at times more boring then anything I have ever
experienced in my entire life, I still got to get attacked by an actual
Hind-D helicopter, Soviet BRDM's, suicide squads with backpacks stuffed with
chemical weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations centers
(TOC) then detonate themselves.

Basically it went like this.

As soon as we got there we started preping for a Light/Heavy Combined Arms
Deliberate Attack Live Fire Exercise.  Basically what this came down to was
we had 155mm and 105mm howitzers, and 81mm mortars with more ammo then you
will ever see in an excercise. Kiowas, M1A2's Bradley's, Tow vehicles,
engineer platoon, and a dismounted platoon.  Our job was to assault through
a bunker complex to set up a support by fire (SBF) posn in order to
facilitate the main efforts assault on the Battalion's (Bn) main obj.

Basically what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to bunker
complex, smash bunker complex, continue smashing path to SBF posn. Once at
SBF posn, smash (put hellacious ammounts of steel on) the Bn  main obj for
15+ minutes to allow a notional Bn Main effort to get up to the obj,
unmolested.

Needles to say it was awesome, I will never see that many assets together,
using that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really bad
somewhere and we go do it for real,  after experiencing this there is no way
in high holy hell I would ever want to be anywhere near the recieving end of
this hellstorm.  It was my first act out of OBC with my Company and the Live
Fire O/C thought I did well enough to warrant recieving a Division coin,

As far as the actual JRTC rotation went it was pretty boring compared to the
Live Fire.  It was four phases, 1. Entry into the Box (seizing an
airfield/foothold) 2.Low Intensity Conflict (LIC) 3. Attack on
Shugart-Gordon (MOUT stuff) 4. Defense.

The only exciting stuff came in phases 1 and 4 when we actually had heavy
contact.  4 was especially cool cause me and my guys were personally
responsible so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to breach
our obstacles in order to pass their main effort of 60 armored vehicles (30
T-62's, and 30 BRDMs) that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated and
tried again (by this time our plt defending the obstacle was wiped out,)
But guess what, my Forward Observer wasn't with the Platoon but was in an OP
closer to the obstacle,  the bad guys smashed the platoons posn and thought
it was safe to try again on breachin the obstacle.  We called a mass repeat
on the obstacle (60 rounds of 155, 105 and 81mm)  needless to say they got
the hell outta there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of smoking
vehicle hulls and a mound dead dismounts.  As a result of destroying their
breach effort we turned them back into the Brigades main Engagement Area
where the Armor guys slugged it out with them for awhile.

Anyways,  JRTC was fun,  if you like ur people, any deployment will be fun,
Louisianna was nice, a welcome change to this Island stuff,  plus the
terrain looked just like home.  In fact it was 1 and a half hours away from
your deer camp Bill, I was tempted to just pack it up and take off walkin
and just wait fer opening day.

Well this concludes my post JRTC brief, any quetions?

Thanks for giving me some competition in b-ball.  You appreciate the old 
school not like these young punks "Bass"  that don't appreciate the tradition 
and hard work  behind the glamour in the NBA.  I will try to keep it close 
and only win by a few.  Unlike the drubbing I gave to Farragut.

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.


-Eric

Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Later-

Eric

Hey Michael,

I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already 
talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on 
that team.

Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the 
championship.

Hook 'em.

Eric

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.  
Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for 
free agents until the start of the season.  If you disagree, let me know.

The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have 
no more than 17 players on your roster at any time.

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.

Remember:

The free add/drop period will end on Wednesday Aug30 at noon.  After that 
point, we will submit add/drop bids to Pat at pryder@enron.com.  

To review:  add/drops will be done through an auction system.  If you want to 
pick up a player you need to submit a bid by e-mail to Pat by 5:00 PM on 
Wednesday of every week.  The person with the highest bid will receive the 
player ($0 bids are acceptable).  

Each team will start with $100 auction dollars.  Each week the team with the 
lowest total points year to date will get $12 added back to their total, the 
team with the highest YTD pt total will get $1 added back and teams in the 
middle will get their according dollar amount based on their rank in YTD pts.


ALL TRADES WILL BE ASSESSED A $5.00 flat fee.


Also, let me know how you want to handle dues (a total of $110).  Should I

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
"You Yankees never do read the Bible!" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, "The three wise men came from afar."

  Court Upholds Florida Vote Deadline
  The Associated Press
  Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2000; 1:04 p.m. EST

  TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that state
  officials may cut off the vote recount in the state's fiercely
  contested presidential election at 5 p.m. EST.

  Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or
  corrected totals after the deadline, and Secretary of State
  Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs "proper
  exercise of discretion."

_______________________________________________

  A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida: A Summary
  Tuesday, November 14, 2000

  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality
  to the election process in Florida.  They believe the American
  people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts
  and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks.

  The vote in Florida has been counted.  It has been recounted.
  Both times, Governor Bush has emerged the winner.  And there
  have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or
  the recount.  Confusion, yes.  Fraud, no.  Yet the Gore
  campaign refuses to accept the result.

  Rather than accept the result, the Gore campaign has demanded
  manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties.  In fact,
  the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic
  precincts in these counties to recount.

  Broward County
  Precinct 1F: 1308 votes for Gore, 62 for Bush;
  Precinct 6F: 1175 votes for Gore, 52 for Bush;
  Precinct 6C: 1071 votes for Gore, 19 for Bush

  This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more
  focused on selectivity than fairness.  Even still, Gore was only
  able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the
  three Gore-chosen counties in Democratic Broward County.  Based
  on this small change in votes, the Broward County canvassing board
  voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county.

  Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials
  to continue the manual count.  This is after they have talked for
  days about letting the local officials run the recounts.  And
  yesterday, the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that
  Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to
  certify its election returns by 5:00pm today.  Amazingly, the
  Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of
  the statute.  It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on
  Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics.

  In sum, the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any
  finality.  They refused to accept the first vote.  They refused
  to accept the recount.  They refused to accept the manual
  recounts in selective counties.

  That's why today Secretary James A. Baker offered the following
  common sense proposal to solve the impasse:

  Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount.  Vice President
  Gore has objected to today's 5:00pm deadline required by Florida
  law.  Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual
  recount up to today's 5:00pm deadline if Vice President Gore
  agrees.  This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive
  process to a reasonable conclusion.

  Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker

  In earlier statements, we have emphasized the importance of
  achieving some finality to the election process, not just here
  in Florida, but of course for the nation as a whole.  More and
  more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see
  uncertainty abroad. I believe that most observers, whether at
  home or abroad, are troubled by the prospect of seemingly
  endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the
  result he seeks.

  The vote in Florida was counted, and then it was recounted.
  Governor Bush was the winner of the vote.  He was the winner
  of the recount. There have been no allegations of vote fraud in
  either the count or in the recount.  No fraud---just confusion
  of some individuals.  Yet the Gore campaign refuses to accept
  the result.

  Las Vegas Sun
  Statistics point to more than random error in Florida vote
  Jace Radke
  11/10/00

  At one in 49 million, the chances of hitting Megabucks on
  one spin are slim, but not as slim as the odds that Vice
  President Al Gore would make up as much ground as he has in
  the Florida recount, according to a UNLV study.

  Economics professor Tom Carroll began running statistical
  equations Thursday on the net gains both Gore, who gained
  more than 2,200 votes, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who
  added about 700 votes, have made in the recount. He found
  that the statistical chances for such large and different
  totals to occur as a result of random glitches was less
  than infinitesimal.

  "The probability of being struck by lightning is about one
  in a million," Carroll said. "The same person would have to
  be hit by lightning 30 times to compare with what we've seen
  in this recount."

  Philadelphia Inquirer
  Gore might lose a second round: Media suppressed the Bush vote
  John R. Lott Jr.
  11/14/00

  With Florida's election results so close, charges of voter
  confusion and intimidation fill the air. Votes have been
  recounted and are being recounted yet again. Because of the
  closeness of the race, problems that have been ignored in the
  past are difficult to ignore now.

  So what has created this incredible closeness? The Gore campaign,
  along with the media, has focused on possible problems in Palm
  Beach county. Supposedly, had it not been for the 19,000 spoiled
  ballots where voters cast more than two votes for president and
  the 3,400 votes that Buchanan received, there would have been a
  Gore victory. But by now many have heard that the spoiled ballots
  are nothing new in Palm Beach, where 14,800 ballots suffered
  similar problems in the last presidential election. Heavily
  Republican Duval County apparently had over 25,000 similarly
  spoiled ballots.

  Buchanan's votes are actually not an anomaly. With 16,695
  registered members of the American Reform, Reform and Independent
  Parties, Palm Beach is a hotbed of Reform party activity. Indeed,
  it has the second highest total Reform and Independent party
  membership of any county in the state. Hillsborough County,
  which comes in third, lags behind with 11,258 members. Up to
  two-thirds of Buchanan's vote in Palm Beach can be explained
  simply by county differences in party registration.

  A more important explanation for the close results exists. By
  prematurely declaring Gore the winner shortly before polls had
  closed in Florida's conservative western Panhandle, the media
  ended up suppressing the Republican vote. Bush obtained over
  65 percent of the vote in the affected area. With only 329 votes
  separating the two candidates Friday morning, even a few hundred
  discouraged votes in addition to the 379,000 cast in Florida's
  western panhandle could have made a crucial difference.

  Chicago Sun-Times
  Many Partial, spoiled ballots
  Scott Fornek and Abdon M. Pallasch
  11/14/00

  Cook County--home of the notorious "butterfly" ballot--was more
  likely than any other Chicago area county to have voters who
  skipped the presidential contest on their ballots last week or
  mistakenly chose more than one candidate.

  City and suburban officials said 122,859 of the 1,987,954 people
  who cast ballots in the county either did not punch a choice in
  the top contest or spoiled their ballot for that race by punching
  more than one hole.

  In Chicago, the 72,934 ballots represented 7.1 percent of all
  ballots cast. In suburban Cook, the 49,925 ballots were 5.2 percent
  of the total.

  Comparable figures in the other five counties ranged from 0.4
  percent for McHenry to 2.5 percent for Will, according to a Chicago
  Sun-Times analysis of last week's vote.

  Election officials in Cook County conceded the numbers were higher
  than normal. But they could not provide an explanation for the
  discrepancy or a breakdown, so it was impossible to tell if the
  absence of votes was largely voluntary or a problem voters had
  with the ballots.

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Subject: Our new puppy Hallie


Hi all!

We went looking at puppies this weekend, supposedly
just "to look," and of course end up bringing one
home!  She has already made the trip to the office and
one of my co-workers had his digital camera here to
take pictures for Halloween!

Hope to talk to each of you soon!

Love, Julia

Well, the only thing that you have to remember is that between where these
are and SMU it is only about 5 miles apart.  In the SMU area there is the
Doubletree, Marriott Courtyard, Residence Inn.

Here is a more comprehensive list that has phone numbers.  I have stayed at
most of the hotels around there and the most bang for your buck is the
Doubletree.  Not too expensive and pretty nice.

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice
and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Saturday would be good for me if you can squeeze it in.  I am going to see
Dad tonight.  I will be there at about 7.

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in
Dallas?

I just wanted to say thanks again for donating to JDF.  The walk was Sunday, 
and the turnout was great!  Last I heard, Enron employees (including 
matching) contributed a total of $468,000!!  I really appreciate your 
generosity--hopefully it will help find a cure for diabetes!

Thanks!!
Allison

LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents
from college

Dear Mom and Dad:

It has now been three months since I left for college. I
have been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my
thoughtlessness in not having written before. I
will bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,
please sit down.

YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.

OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of
the window of my dormitory when it caught
fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and he was the one who called the fire department
and the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,
since I had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share
his apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but
it's kind of cute.

He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date
yet, but it will be before my pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are
looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will
welcome the baby and give it the love,
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.

The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my
boyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from
passing our pre-marital blood tests, and I
carelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will
welcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,
although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is
of a different race and religion than ours, I know your
often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered
by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from
ours. I am sure you will love him as I do.

His family background is good too, for I am told that his
father is an important gun-bearer in the village from which
he came.

Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I
am not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis
and there is no man in my life.

However, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

Your Loving Daughter.

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=
is=20
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely," said Marbury. "I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable."  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

I have selected December 7th and 8th as the days for us to get together in 
the Houston office to go over your year.  I will be able to retrieve your 
completed feedback reports by then and hopefully will have spoken to your 
supervisor.  Please send me your availability for those two days.  I will 
need 30 minutes but we should schedule for an hour. Be patient, I am between 
jobs and am my own assistant.  If you cannot meet on either day, (if you are 
in Brazil, for instance) we will work something out. (send a suggestion or 
two)  Please respond to this as soon as possible so I can get everyone 
scheduled.  Thanks

PS Please make sure you are sending emails to Don Black / SA/   not to Don 
Black / EES/  or Donald Black / ENA/

_________________________________________________________________

1
REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
"The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
"...the tone...was perfect...

"There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts."

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, "should." You know, Yogi Berra once said,
"It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: "...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists."

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: "...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, "Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?"  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing..."

my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no

BLEDSOE NOW APPEARS  READY TO START VS. CHIEFS...

According to reports out of Foxboro, New England  Patriots quarterback Drew=
=20
Bledsoe took his regular  turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid=
ay=20
and all  indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as =
=20
usual against the Chiefs Monday night.=20

Of course, that hardly means Bledsoe is  100 percent healthy; he's anything=
=20
but. And whether it's jammed,  bruised, sprained, fractured, broken or just=
=20
plain old sore, the  real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th=
e=20
thumb on his  throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability=
=20
to  throw the ball.=20

Not surprisingly, head coach Bill  Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off=
=20
than he's been the  previous three weeks.=20

"This is the 13th week of the season.  There will be a lot of players out=
=20
there on both teams who will be  less than 100 percent, and (Chiefs=20
quarterback  Elvis) Grbac is one of them," said  Belichick. "Same thing wit=
h=20
our quarterback. That's football in the  13th week of the season."=20

Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in  Detroit on Thanksgiving day, but=
=20
regressed as the game progressed,  throwing two crucial fourth-quarter=20
interceptions that kept the team  from mounting a realistic comeback... And=
=20
even though Bledsoe  continues to insist the thumb isn't affecting his=20
throws, you'd be  hard-pressed to find any evidence backing that contention=
.=20

The bottom line here says a lack quality  depth at the key offensive skill=
=20
positions around him make it very  difficult to rely on Bledsoe for=20
consistent production...=20

Other items of interest...=20

Michael Felger of  the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with  the=
=20
weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at less-than-full speed,  coaches=
=20
would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs. The  question is whethe=
r=20
injury-prone J.R. Redmond will  be up to the task. If not, look for Belichi=
ck=20
to spread the load  between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass. =20

Reserve tight end Chris  Eitzmann (ribs) was placed on injured reserve for=
=20
the  season, leaving the Pats with one roster spot to fill... Starting  wid=
e=20
out Troy Brown (leg) was the only player not  to fully participate at=20

Cincinnati Enquirer reporter  Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals=

head coach  Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as  "probable" to star=
t=20
at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals  tomorrow.=20

Mitchell missed last week's game against Pittsburgh  because of a sprained=
=20
left knee. This week, his mobility was better as he took  60 percent of the=
=20
practice snaps and Akili Smith took 40  percent.=20

=01&I think probable's a good word,=018 LeBeau said. =01&We're  gonna see h=

Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Friday's  practice.=20

=01&I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to  go,=018 he said.=20

LeBeau said Mitchell probably won't need a Sunday  morning test, as he did=
=20
last week before the Pittsburgh game.=20

=01&I don't think that will be necessary, unless some  complications develo=
p=20

According to those who follow the team closely, the  Bengals would like to=

use the team's remaining games to evaluate Mitchell before  attempting to=
=20
re-sign to the veteran signal caller to compete with third-year  man-to-be=

Smith for the starting QB job next season.=20

Team president Mike Brown made the  statements after watching Mitchell=20
participate in his first practice in 10 days  Thursday...=20

Other items of interest...=20

Brown's continuous and vehement denials haven't  stopped the speculation=20
regarding his future role with the team...  SportsLine.com jumped on the=20
bandwagon this week when the  reported that the man I like to call the=20
"Neanderthal GM" is thinking seriously  about reducing his own role and=20

"I don't have five friends," he stated flatly... =20

And finally... Rookie wide out Peter  Warrick said his skipping a=20
team-mandated eye appointment last Tuesday  was an oversight. But if he ski=

GROH UPBEAT AS MARTIN  CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS...

ESPN's John Clayton reported last night  that New York Jets halfback Curtis=

Martin took all  of his regular snaps Friday and should be fine for Sunday'=

Martin still has a bruised gluteus  maximus, but he's in better shape than=

last week. The fact that he  opened the week listed a probable rather than=

Martin's current condition by saying, "Fine, fine..."=20

That's about as in-depth, detailed and  upbeat reply I've heard him utter=

But seriously folks... The soreness in  Martin's booty could linger, but it=

Rookie tight end Anthony  Becht now has a neck injury to go along with the=

his absence has clearly left a void in the  team's vertical passing game th=

work in during practice late  this week and could return at or near full=20
speed sometime next  week... In the meantime, Windrell Hayes will  continue=
=20
to come off the bench as the number-three man until Coles  return...=20

Former Steeler wide out Malcolm  Johnson is becoming part of the Jets syste=

as expected,  Groh said. The newcomer's biggest challenge is simply learnin=

how  the Jets operate.=20

"He's getting more comfortable with the  plays and the words," Groh said.=

"Every team has a different  language and you have to adjust to that. He=20

And finally... While the Jets obviouly  have some kind of plan in mind for=

implementing Leon  Johnson, it's too early to tell when he might be able to=
 =20
follow through on such a plan.=20

"We saw some of the skills that made him  a good player in the past," Groh=
=20
said of Johnson's first workout  with the team on Wednesday. "But you also=
=20
saw that he started  training camp (Wednesday)."=20

After blowing out his left knee in the  Jets' season opener last year,=20
Johnson is eager to work his way back  into the mix...=20

"Some guys take two days to get ready in  training camp," Groh said. "Some=

guys take 10 days or two weeks.  That's where we are with Leon."=20

"I'm feeling good," Johnson said. "It's  just real good to be back out ther=

NFL insider John Clayton, the  Panthers deactivated the former first-round=

 >AP. A Texas A&M University student who claimed he had been raped by
a dog
 >was yesterday jailed for 12 months.
 >
 >Martin Hoyle, 20, was arrested by police after the passengers of a
passing
 >car witnessed a Bull Terrier, called Badger, having sex with Hoyle
on the

 >
 >Assistent District Attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers of
the car,
an

thought
 >Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.  But when they got closer
they saw
 >that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down on all fours,
and the
 >dog was straddling him from behind.
 >
 >"The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken a
liking to
 >him," said Mr Crossland."The couple were extremely offended and
sickened by
 >what they saw." Another individual in a passing car contacted
police on a
 >cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog on
the
 >feeder road.
 >
 >Hoyle, of College Station, told police "I can't help it if the dog
took a
 >liking to me.He tried to rape me." He repeated the rape allegation
at
 >the police station and added, "The dog pulled my jeans down."
 >
 >Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on alcohol-related
charges, was

outraged
 >public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incident
because
 >of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful and
incredibly
 >embarrassed.
 >
 >Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle "Never before in my
time at
 >the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who
 >voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public
 >highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension. It is an

witness."

If you would like for me to send cards to your customers, please provide me 
with a list of their names and addresses by next Friday, 11/17.  I will get 
the amount of cards as per however many customer names I am given.  I will 
then have everyone sign one card so that I can send it out to get the 
signatures lasered on the customer's cards.  I've already spoken with the 
others on the desk, and they either aren't interested or they've gotten their 
primary assistants to take care of it.

Elsa, as we've previously discussed, I can use the list that we just recently 
updated.  Please let me know if you are going to select people from that 
list, or if you are just going to send a card to everybody on it.

Thanks guys,
Laura

If anybody's looking for some sunglasses, I just found a website that
has some badass glasses at a pretty good discount.  Anyway, just thought
I'd let you know...

Hey Amir,

That sunglass company I was working for just put up a website at
http://www.afterlasik.com where they are selling amazing sunglasses.  They
are running a promotion for the first three weeks of December where the
glasses are in the $70-90 range (that's like 30% off).

The sunglasses are the best--better than Maui Jim, Oakley, and Costa Del
Mar.  And those cost about $120-150.  I sent a pair to my brother for
Christmas, and it was less than $80.

Thought I'd pass the deal around.  Speak to you soon,

Oren

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31.
"The end zones were confusing," says Slocum.  "I'm sure that some of the
touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours. We
were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points.  There's no way we lost this one.  A&M demands a
recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous".  "They agreed to the size,

shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU
coach Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said
so before we started.  You don't get to keep playing until you're happy
with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five
points many times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well
as that darn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.
"We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the
winner of the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end  zones

were used.  "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"

says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside
bearing signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"  Students'
thoughts echoed their signs.  "All we want is a fair total of the points
before we declare a winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.
"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite
the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point.  At about 2:30 pm, with
the
game still too close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.

College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call.  "We felt that with
a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies,
we were certain A&M would carry this game.  We may have been premature in
our prediction."

A&M / UT Grads (or anyone wanting to become an honorary grad),

 Sorry for the late notice, but we (we meaning UT and A&M grads here at 
Enron) are trying to raise money for scholarships 
for the two greatest schools in Texas (well, one is slightly better than the 
other).  We are having a Flag Football challenge tomorrow
(sorry, all the teams are full).  If you would like to come to show some 
support, it should be a blast!  I have to have the money 
collected by 5:00 PM today.  Any contributions will be matched by Enron.  If 
you would like to contribute to A&M, make checks 
payable to Texas A&M Foundation.  For UT, make them payable to University of 
Texas at Austin (why do they always have to 
call it UT at Austin, like anyone would assume you meant UT Arlington when 
you say UT?).  Anyway, ANY contributions will be 
GREATLY appreciated.  Call me at x54915 and I'll be glad to come get them, or 
stop by my location at EB652b.

Thanks!
Jonathan Anderson
Class of '99 (A&M)

P.S. Here's the web site with more information about the event.:

Ami,
 
 Could you confirm with Janet if the two deals mentioned above should be 
Reliant Energy - Entex or Entex Gas Marketing?  Entex called & advised they 
show it to be a sell to Entex Gas Marketing & that's the way I see it as 
well.  Just let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=

as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=

a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=

points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=

forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20

=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by=
=20
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is no=
w=20
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.    =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for=20
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and=
=20
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall unt=
il=20
he appears to be fully recovered.   =20

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00=20
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=
=20
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=
=20
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his=
=20
Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=
=20
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have mu=
ch=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
"I can't give you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but=
=20
it looks good." Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will=
=20
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=
d=20
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does retu=
rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=
e=20
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host=
=20
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=
ir=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. "Air Canada" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. "We=
'd=20
like to have him back as soon as possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,=
=20
"but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready." Toronto finishes=
=20
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at=
=20
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be bac=
k=20
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup i=
n=20
time for next week.   =20

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago=20
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a=20
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in=20
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from=20
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your=
=20
starting lineup.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against=20
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left kne=
e,=20
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day =
to=20
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday=20
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy=
=20
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next=
=20
week's games.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00=20
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that=
=20
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all=
=20
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudle=
y=20
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to=
=20
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding=20
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his=
=20
position.   =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain =
in=20
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and=
=20
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mil=
ls=20
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop h=
im=20
from your roster and add another forward.    =20

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. =
=20
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's stat=
us=20
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment =
so=20
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your=20
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The=
=20
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bett=
er=20
guard.   =20

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  "Never 
Nervous" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams says he is ready to play in Thursday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left knee.  He 
injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against Phoenix.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped "The Man of Steel" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.    

 Jason Williams , G SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams dazzled the Sacramento crowd and his opposition Wednesday by 
dishing out 12 assists in his first game back from a league induced 
suspension.  He was suspended for the first five games of the season for 
failing to comply with his drug treatment plan.  Williams appeared to be in 
great shape and is ready to be a Fantasy star this year.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Jones played in Wednesday's game at Dallas after suffering a concussion on 
Monday.  He scored five points and had three assists.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  No timetable on his return has been reported.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Gill left Wednesday night's game against the Wizards in the first half after 
feeling some pain in his knee. He has had a variey of injuries early in the 
season, including suffering a scratched cornea and dealing with back spasms. 
Despite the soreness in his knee, Gill doesn't expect to miss any court time, 
and should play in tonight's game against the Pistons.     

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Wallace fell awkwardly on his left leg after being fouled by Sixers' forward 
George Lynch in Wednesday night's game.  He sat out the rest of the night as 
a precaution, but expects to be in the lineup tonight when the Pistons face 
off against the Nets.     

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Herren, who is due to come off the injury list this weekend, will start at 
point guard against Philadelphia on Saturday.  He has been sidelined with an 
ankle injury, which has caused him to miss Boston's first four games.  

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play 
his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.

Thanks,

The last I heard was that each of the Enron teams from each school would play 
each other on a weekday night or something (I had heard this Wed. for the two 
A&M teams).  Then we might have the two Enron winners play each other, with 
the winner possibly playing the Andersen winner (if they decide to play).  
That's the latest I've heard though.  Webb Jennings was supposed to be 
calling Simmons about the rescheduling.

we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, 
but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are 
more open.
you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.

what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow?

suggestion... make a playbook that just shows individual routes.. that way 
Luis can just customize  in the huddle....

Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc...     


also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll 
out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... 

AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel....

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third 
down receiver. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in 
Jurevicius' left knee. Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected 
to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks.  Ron Dixon will take over 
as the Giants' third down receiver. At this point, neither player has any 
real Fantasy value.     

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking 
Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to 
only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held 
the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a 
cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this 
effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and 
hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week.   

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for 
the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't 
be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp.    

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a "realistic chance" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.

Hi Folks,

We've been downgrading Chicago WR Marcus Robinson already with Shane
Matthews throwing the ball but here's more bad news from my friends at
www.nfltalk.com

http://www.sportstalk.com/nfl/rumors/index.shtml From the article:  The
Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this
weekend's game with Green Bay and his status will be updated tomorrow.

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.



Joe

  Dear Friend:

  I want to remind you that today is election day.  Our
  generation has a chance to make a difference - to send a
  signal that we want new leaders who trust you, not

  entrepreneurial spirit, your trust in initiative, and your
  commitment to leaving behind a better world than you
  inherited.

  Our Republican team would provide that kind of leadership.
  George W. Bush and all of our great Republican candidates
  will focus on results, not daily polls.

  The other side has been running non-stop negative attacks
  against our candidates.  Don't let their fear tactics
  succeed.  Please take your family and friends to the
  polls today and vote for George W. Bush and all of our
  great Republican team.

  Thank you very much.

  George P. Bush


_____________________________________________________________

  LAST CHANCE!

  The polls will close in a few hours.  The Party that best
  gets its voters to the polls will win.  Please forward
  this email to your friends and encourage them to vote.
  Thank you!

A Report From the 2000 World Women's Liberation Conference The
 first speaker, a lady from England stood up and said,"During last years'
conference we spoke about being more assertive with our husbands.
 Well, after the conference I went home and told my husband,
 Barrington,that I would no longer cook for him and that he would have to do
it himself!
 After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw
nothing.But on the third day, I saw that he had cooked a wonderful roast
lamb." The crowd cheered.
 The second speaker, a lady from Russia stood up and said, "After last
years'conference I went home and told my husband, Ivan, that I would no
longer do his laundry and that he would have to do it himself.
After the first day, I saw nothing.  After the second day, I saw nothing.But
on the third day, I saw that he had done not only his own washing, but my
washing as well." The crowd again cheered.
 The third speaker, a Cajun lady from Thibodaux, Louisiana, stood
 up and said, "Afta last years' conference, I went rat home and tole dat
lazy Coonass husband'a mine, Boudreaux, dat I wadn't gonna do no mo'a his
cookin', cleanin' or shoppin' and dat he wuz gonna have to do it all fer
hissef."  The crowd got to their feet and roared approval.  When it became
quiet, she continued, "And I tole'em I wadn't gonna be
doin'no mo cleanin' em nasty crawfeesh, giggin' no mo boolfrogs and water
dawgs, skinnin' none'a dem musrats and nutrias or check'n no mo
catfeesh trotlines."
The crowd went wild - the cheering and clapping lasted for at
least five minutes. Well, the fust day,I didn't saw nuttin'.  Afta the
second day, I didn't saw nuttin'too. But afta the thud day, I could saw a

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.  

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 The Steelers will be without Burress likely for the remainder of the season 
after learning he has a torn ligament and two broken bones in his right 
wrist. He said he originally sustained the injury during the season opener, 
but played the next 11 games despite constant pain in the wrist. Burress had 
it X-rayed and placed in a cast after practice yesterday, and it will require 
surgery. With him out, Courtney Hawkins will continue to start in his place 
for the next four games.  

 Jamel White , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Browns have listed White as questionable with a shoulder injury for 
Sunday's game against Jacksonville. He has performed fairly well spelling 
fellow rookie Travis Prentice in recent weeks, and may earn himself 
consideration in the Browns' RB plans for 2001. He won't provide you with 
much this season, though.  

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/30/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson, who has a knee 
injury, and Erik Storz, who has a broken thumb, as well as safety Erik Olson, 
who has an ankle injury, for Sunday's game against the Browns. Fortunately, 
linebackers Lonnie Marts, listed as probable after missing four games with a 
groin injury, and Kevin Hardy, probable with an ankle injury, are both 
expected to play. Despite all the injuries, keep in mind that this might be 
the best week to start the Jacksonville defense, as it faces a Cleveland 
offense that has been decimated by injuries.   

 Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 "The Green Lantern" had his light burned out last week against the Bears, 
catching only one pass for eight yards in the entire game. After four solid 
weeks, Chrebet has caught only four passes for 41 yards over his last two 
games. He faces off against a Colts' secondary that he burned for eight 
catches and 140 yards receiving in Week Ten, so a productive day is certainly 
not out of the question. Although he hasn't been overly consistent, Chrebet 
will likely find his way onto many starting lineups as the playoffs begin.    

 Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Shea is listed as questionable with a thigh muscle injury for Sunday's game 
in Jacksonville. If he can't play, either Mark Campbell, who served as the 
starter last Sunday, or O.J. Santiago would be the tight end. Even if he's 
healthy, Shea isn't going to carry your Fantasy team through the playoffs.  

 Richie Anderson , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Anderson continued to be the Jets' secret weapon last week, catching six 
passes for 69 yards and a score against the Bears. Although Anderson's 
numbers have been commendable between the lines, his value in the world of 
Fantasy isn't as solid. Unless you are involved in a deeper league, avoid 
playing Anderson during your Fantasy playoffs.      

 O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Santiago is listed as questionable with a knee injury for the Browns' game 
in Jacksonville on Sunday. If he can't go, Mark Campbell would be the backup 
tight end, and if Aaron Shea is also out, then Marc Edwards would serve as 
Campbell's backup for the second straight game. We don't recommend any of the 
Browns' tight ends.  

 Bernie Parmalee , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Parmalee has been surprisingly productive over the past two weeks while 
splitting time with Curtis Martin, who has been less than 100 percent after 
injuring his gluteus maximus. Parmalee caught six passes and accounted for 74 
yards of total offense in last week's win over Chicago.  Starting Parmalee in 
the playoffs, however, is extremely risky, so stick with Martin or look to 
another option if possible.    

 Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Browns Coach Chris Palmer hasn't made a final decision on who will start at 
quarterback Sunday against Jacksonville, although if Pederson's bruised ribs 
don't heal in time, it would make the decision an easy one. Pederson was held 
out of throwing drills yesterday and will probably be limited the rest of the 
week, and looks to be a gametime decision. Palmer may opt to use rookie 
Spergon Wynn this week either way. Considering the Browns' struggles in the 
passing game added to this quarterback controversy, Pederson isn't going to 
help Fantasy owners during the playoffs.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 According to The Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals are planning on 
evaluating Mitchell over the next few games in hopes that he will re-sign to 
compete with Akili Smith for the starting QB job next season. Team president 
Mike Brown made the statements after watching Mitchell participate in his 
first practice in 10 days yesterday. Mitchell is expected to start Sunday 
against Arizona after missing last Sunday's game with a sprained knee 
ligament. Despite a weak Cardinals' defense, we don't recommend him for your 
league's playoff run.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Sanders is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Bengals 
with a quadricep injury.  The injury certainly hasn't helped his numbers - he 
has caught only five passes for 63 yards in his last two games.  Avoid 
starting Sanders if at all possible, especially during the playoffs.  He is 
far too inconsistent to play at such a crucial stage of your Fantasy 
season.     

 David Boston , WR ARI - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Boston caught only one pass for 32 yards in last week's loss to the Giants.  
He has been hampered by a nagging hamstring injury of late, which hasn't help 
his numbers in recent weeks.  He has had only one game with more than 90 
yards receiving in the last six weeks, and has scored only once in that same 
span. If the Cards' enemic offense is ever going to score, however, it could 
be against the Bengals. Unless you have more solid receivers on your roster, 
starting Boston simply on this week's matchup isn't a bad move.     

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Hearst is listed as questionable on the injury report but won't be of any 
help to a Fantasy team this season.  He was recently activated from the 
injury list after missing most 1999 and 2000 with an ankle injury.    

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/30/00 
 Moore has been downgraded to questionable on the injury report.  He suffered 
a shoulder stinger in Sunday's game against St. Louis.  If he is unable to 
play Chad Morton and Terry Allen will handle the carries.  The Saints have 
been able to run on every team they have played this season no matter who 
their RB is.  But if you are going to use a New Orleans back go with Morton 
who is the healthiest and most explosive of the bunch.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 Jones could see some increased playing time now that the season is coming to 
a close, but he will still have little impact for Fantasy owners at this 
point in the season. Jones' rookie campaign has been a real disappointment, 
and he should have been a casuality for owners much earlier in the year.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Pittman had a huge game against the Giants last week, catching ten passes 
while compiling 193 yards of total offense. He also scored the Cardinals' 
only touchdown of the game on a 36-yard pass from Dave Brown. Pittman will 
face a Cincinnati defense this week that ranks 24th in the league against the 
run, so he could be in line for another strong performance. The only thing 
that Fantasy owners who have Pittman on their roster should worry about is if 
Arizona decides to give rookie Thomas Jones more playing time now that the 
season is winding down.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Rams are expected to decide on Thursday whether or not Wilkins is 
healthy enough to play.  He will undergo an extensive kicking routine and 
will be evaluated from thereafter.  Wilkins has missed the past few games 
because of a quadriceps injury.  

 Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Mean Machine Updated 11/30/00 
 Hayes practiced Wednesday and will likely play in Sunday's game against the 
Rams.  He missed Monday's game against the Rams due to a groin injury.  Hayes 
hasn't been a star by no means this season but he has been helpful to Fantasy 
teams.    

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 11/30/00 
 It looks like rookie Brad Hoover will start at RB again this Sunday for the 
Panthers.  Biakabutuka has been sidelined for the past few weeks by turf 
toe.  He was initally listed as probable for Sunday's home game against the 
Rams but left practice early Wednesday after experiencing pain in his toe.  
"I'd say right now his status is probably a little more questionable than I 
thought it would be," head coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer . 
 It would be wise to keep Biakabutuka out of your lineup.  Although Hoover 
had a good game this week it might even be safer to use a more proven back on 
your Fantasy team.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/30/00 
 Wheatley practiced on Wednesday and is listed as probable for this week's 
game against the Steelers. Head Coach Jon Gruden said that Wheatley moved 
around well during the workout, so expect the Raiders' back to be ready to 
play. Wheatley has proven that he has a high tolerance for pain, so even if 
he isn't 100 percent for the Pittsburgh game, Fantasy owners can rest assured 
that he will play.     

 Herbert Goodman , RB GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 The Packers have activated Goodman from their practice squad.  He had played 
in five games this season before being placed on the practice team on 
November 1.  He is used primarily on special teams and will be of little use 
to a Fantasy team at this point in the year.   

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now 
recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee.  He still hopes to return 
for a December 10 game against the Lions.  Right now he is having trouble 
pushing off on his knee.  Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league 
until next season.     

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/30/00 
 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday 
night's game against New England.  Although he is still listed as 
questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is 
optimistic. "Right now, I'd say he'll play," said Cunningham, "but we'll see 
what (today) brings." Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it 
would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - 
especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning.    

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he 
missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously 
optimistic that he  could return for this week's game against Buffalo. 
Despite experiencing a slight "tweak" in the hamstring after Wednesday's 
practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. "I feel fine," Smith 
said, "I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."  
Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however,  would be 
wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could 
hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this 
point of the season.     

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now "optimistic" that Fiedler 
will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He 
took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice 
and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for 
Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. "If he's OK 
(today), he's starting," said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does 
start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have 
advanced to their league's playoffs.     

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season.  Where have we heard 
this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised 
to run over the opposition.  He looked slow carrying the ball this season and 
was replaced at HB by James Allen.  With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, 
Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere.  He is down to 242 
pounds already and would like to reach 235.  Even if he does reach this goal 
don't count on him being too productive.  Wait and see if he re-emerges as a 
star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year.     

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 
 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's 
game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell.  It 
appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season.  His seperated shoulder 
rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000,  but even when he was 
healthy he didn't produce too much.    

More Updates 

 Player News?Teams? 
 Meximullets Player News 

 Charlie Garner , Active RB Updated 11/13/00 
Garner emerged from a two-week slump by gaining 102 yards on 25 carries and 
scoring a touchdown. Look for Garner to have a big game next week against a 
thin Atlanta Falcons defense. 

 Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 11/22/00 
Freeman had a relatively quiet game Sunday against the Colts catching only 
three passes for 37 yards. He did manage to haul in a 17-yard TD pass from 
Brett Favre. No. 2 receiver Bill Schroeder won't have the game that he had 
last week, which will allow the mediocre Panthers' secondary to focus on 
stopping Freeman. His numbers will improve this week but only slightly. 

 Skip Hicks , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/00 
Hicks saw limited action in Sunday's game against the Ravens. He rushed three 
times for seven yards and caught one pass for five yards. Unless Stephen 
Davis goes down, Hicks won't see much action. 

 Amani Toomer , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 
Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday 
night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' 
secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the 
team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups 
this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. 

 Justin Watson , Reserve RB Updated 11/13/00 
Watson fared better in his second start for Marshall Faulk Sunday. He gained 
62 yards on 17 carries. 

 Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 11/17/00 
With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the start 
this week against the Chiefs. If Morris has been one of your main tailbacks 
this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available. 

 Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 
Torry Holt caught six passes for 89 yards against the Saints Sunday. Look for 
Holt to put up similar numbers against the Panthers Sunday. 

 Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 
McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total 
offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put 
the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in 
first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee 
squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect 
huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point 
of Philadelphia's offense once again. 

 Kyle Brady , Active TE Updated 10/30/00 
Brady finally found the end zone, scoring a touchdown in what was a career 
game for him against Dallas Sunday. Just one week after an eight-catch, 
111-yard performance against Washington, Brady broke loose for 10 catches for 
138 yards. Keep in mind that he's been getting opportunities lately due to 
the injury to Jimmy Smith, so his numbers shouldn't remain so extraordinary, 
but Mark Brunell will likely look to his tight end more often in the future. 

 Gary Anderson , Active K Updated 11/29/00 
Anderson continued his accuracy this season by making both of his attempts on 
Thanksgiving Day. He has made 20-of-21 attempts this season and is quietly 
having a year similar to the one he had in 1998 when he was perfect in the 
regular season. However, he is old and doesn't kick the long ones like he 
used to. Anderson won't go beyond 50 yards anymore but is pinpoint from 30-49 
yards. Look for him to add a few more field goals against the Lions this 
week. 

 Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 11/28/00 
Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in 
this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last 
week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. 
The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, 
especially with the playoffs just around the corner. 

 Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/29/00 
Head coach Steve Mariucci is considering giving Garcia's backups Rick Mirer 
and Tim Rattay some playing time at the end of games to evaluate their 
standing with the team. This won't hurt Garcia's production too much but 
could cost him a few cheap TDs at the end of games. "We've talked about it," 
Mariucci told the Contra Costa Times . "I wouldn't mind Rick Mirer playing a 
little bit, either. ... If a situation presented itself when you could put 
your third guy (Rattay) in there without hurting the football team, I guess 
we would consider that." 

 Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 11/20/00 
The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches. He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday. 

 Darnell Autry , Reserve RB Updated 11/27/00 
On nine carries, Autry gained just 25 yards. If you start him at anytime 
during the Fantasy playoffs, you may be risking your season. 

 Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 
Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. 
While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 
receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five 
contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one 
touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane 
Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another 
week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. 

 Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 
Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming 
the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted 
yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its 
record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just 
seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, 
an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to 
say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore 
has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense 
during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and 
Arizona coming off the bye. 

 Redskins , Active DT Updated 11/17/00 
The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the 
Rams. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, while Barber 
has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Washington will 
need a big performance from their defense on Monday night if they are to have 
any chance at beating the champs in the dome.

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Voskuhl was placed on the injured list by Chicago with a right hip flexor 
strain today. One of the Bulls second-round picks in the June draft, Voskuhl 
was averaging 1.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in four games this season.  

 Dalibor Bagaric , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Bulls today activated Bagaric, the 24th pick overall in the June draft. 
He had missed Chicago's first 10 games with a bruised right knee. Bagaric 
averaged 18.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Benston Zagreb of the Croatian 
League last year.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors waived Livingston today, less than one week after signing him 
as a free agent. He had appeared in only two games and was expendable with 
the return of Bob Sura from injury.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Warriors activated Sura from the injured list today. He had been 
sidelined all season with a lower back injury suffered during training camp. 
The 27-year-old was acquired in June from Cleveland via Milwaukee in a 
three-team deal, after he had posted a career-high 13.8 point-per-game 
average with the Cavaliers.  

 Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers activated Sundov from the injured list after placing Tyus Edney 
on the same list today. The 20-year-old center had been sidelined all season 
with a sprained left ankle.  

 Tyus Edney , G IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Pacers placed Edney on the injured list today with plantar fasciatis in 
his left foot. The 5-10, 152-pound center will miss a minimum of five games. 
He was averaging 3.4 points and 1.9 assists in eight games this season.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Thorpe received a cortisone shot in his ailing left foot, and he will be 
sidelined another four weeks. He was placed on the injured list on Thursday 
after averaging 3.0 points and 1.7 rebounds in six games.  

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Camby had an MRI during Sunday's game which confirmed that he only has a 
sprained ankle.  He turned the ankle in Friday night's win over Phoenix.  He 
is listed as day to day, and it is unclear whether he will begin playing 
tonight or tomorrow. Camby has been the best center in the Eastern Confernece 
thus far, so make sure to start him as soon as he returns to the lineup.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 Brandon, who has missed four games with an ankle sprain, practiced for the 
first time on Monday since being hurt on Nov. 9.  He said he might return to 
the lineup when the Timberwolves host the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday 
night.     

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 After initially expecting a return to the court tonight against Cleveland, 
it seems that Jones will miss at least tonight's game - and likely more. "The 
doctor told me flat out," Jones said, "it's going to be awhile."  Jones tried 
to participate in drills yesterday, but his injured calf continued to tighten 
on him.  If Jones is on your roster, it's a good idea to keep him on the 
bench until his prognosis is a bit more clear.    

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/21/00 
 Nowitzki re-aggravated a left shoulder injury in the third quarter of Monday 
night's game against the Jazz.  He left the game and did not return, but did 
post 20 points and 14 rebounds before exiting.  He is not expected to miss 
any time because of the injury.  Nowitzki is establishing himself as a real 
Fantasy star, so continue to start him as long as his shoulder holds up.    

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  "It's very 
painful at times," said Thomas. "The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible."  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.

Mike,

I haven't heard anything, so I am assuming that the tourney is off. I do, 
however, still have the money that I collected for UT.  I would still like to 
turn the money in.  Who should I direct it to.

Thanks,

Eric

Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

Jamie Hogan

Subject: WINNING TICKET


Dear  State 
Lottery Commission,

??? I know I chose the  
winning numbers for Wednesday's Lotto drawing.? But
upon further  review, 
it appears the incorrect numbers appeared on my
ticket.
How  could this 
happen?? The root cause of this dilemma is the form I  filled
out to get 
my ticket.? The form is very confusing.? I  thought I 
was
choosing
one set of numbers, (the winning numbers), when  in reality I 
chose a
completely different set of numbers.? The  numbers and boxes on 
the form are
so close together, it's impossible to  determine which box to 
fill in for
which number.
??? I  checked with at least 3,000 
other people, and they all had the exact
same  problem.? I'm sure if you 
review the form I filled out, it will  become
very clear that I'm entitled to 
the money from Wednesday's  drawing.? Please
reply with the date, time, 
and location, for me to  collect the winnings due
to me.

Thank you for your assistance in this  
matter.

Al  
Gore

I definitely think trips on occasional plays will work.  Draw up some.  Try 
and make everything on one sheet so we can print it out and just take one 
piece of paper out there.  I will also draw up some and put it on whatever 
sheet you send me.

I was thinking that if we run trips on offense the other team won't know what 
hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.


What do you think?

 "Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, "What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?"  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  "Little Hitlers," they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, "Heil
Hitler" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those "littlest" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

Dale,

The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.  We already have a 
baseload Index Corpus product.  We need to create a DAY Corpus product with 
the same parameters as this baseload product.


Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?

Thanks,

Eric

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Saturday would be good for me if you can squeeze it in.  I am going to see
Dad tonight.  I will be there at about 7.

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

miss again this week.  Shane Matthews is expected to get the start
this week.  Cade is listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.  He
would probably play if Matthews were to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter despite
a sore knee.  He practiced on Wednesday.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses his
ribs.  The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will
look to Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.  Either
way, look for Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.

QB Clint Stoerner was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return the last week of the NFL
season at the earliest.  Gus Frerotte will start in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and is expected
to take the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable
whether he will start.  The coaching staff has yet to name a
starter.  I rate his chances at 85% to start.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks
like he will start this Sunday.  He is listed as questionable on the
injury report with a sore shoulder and neck.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.  He appears as
questionable on the injury report again with a  sore thumb and a
bruised ego.  He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays
hurt.  If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100%
knee) to take the field.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar
play.   He starts again this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to
start.

QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more
than that to keep him off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a
more durable body.  He appears on the injured list again as
questionable with a sore knee.  Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,
will start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock
Huard.  Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just
released from the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in
practice.  He will start this week.  Trent Green will back him up.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against
the Cowboys.  Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this
week.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt
thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George
watches.  I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running backs in the News:

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and
is questionable for this week's game.  He is having trouble
making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He
is listed as probable with a sore toe.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.  Look for
Travis Prentice to "shoulder" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start
this week.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.  Mike
Anderson gets the start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.  Ahman Green will get
the start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report
with a tender hamstring.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with
bruised ribs, but he expects to play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.  He may now
be ready for the last game of the regular season.  His cast is
expected to come off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore neck.  He is still expected to start though, but Chad
Morton may see a few more reps than usual.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.  He is
listed as probable with a sore gluteous.  I am guessing he is the
butt of many New York jokes.

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger,
but his ankles are better.  He will play this week.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using
the time to look for personalized items with his last name.  We will
keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.
On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande
and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the
inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play
with the pain.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway.  The team
remains cautious in his comeback.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week.  Look for Warrick Dunn
to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects
to practice today and play this weekend.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm.  Look for the
Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to
play with a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he
injured in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore
knee.  He did not practice on Wednesday.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.  Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than
Yancey Thigpen=01(=01(=01(well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy
either.
Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as
questionable on the injury report.  He says he will be ready to play
though.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe.  With Tony
Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal
for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore leg, but he expects to play.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the
injury report.  Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough
to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius
will start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out
with a twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee,
but even if he played he would likely be ineffective.  Hines Ward has
been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all
year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking
like he will be on the field though.  He was quoted in the Sacramento
Bee as saying he is 85% right now.  I am guessing he is closer to
70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his
turf toe.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this
week.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.
Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his
condition.  He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to
whether he plays.  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar
so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play
this week.

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play
with a sore knee.

TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee.  Fantasy players are
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps.
He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this
weekend.  He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as
questionable on the injury report with a sore knee.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass
last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.  If Grbac plays, expect
him to get the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to
play.

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.  John Davis still gets
a lot of looks though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.  But he has
looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall
minutes before game-time.  Now that the Rams are tied for first
though, expect the players to start working through the pain.  I rate
Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to remind you that only postID of calcs that have TDS Flag (in 
Port Calc screen) set to "1" are included in TDS position load.  We have 
noticed that ST-Bammel, ST-Bridgeline, GD-Texas,... and many more desks do 
not have the TDS Flag set to "1".

Please call me (x30413) or Bill Kasemervisz (x57579) if you have any 
questions.

In its first week, the ThinkBank's Idea Vault received more than 35 ideas 
from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh, 
no.  Connections have been made, dialogues have been started, things are 
happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/02/00 
 Batch should be able to play next weekend against Green Bay, despite leaving 
Thursday's game against Minnesota.   "He didn't reinjure his ribs or 
anything," team doctor David Collon said. "It was too sore for him to feel he 
could play effectively, so we just gave up after the first two series."   
Batch received numbing injections to ease pain in his ribs. Collon said no 
X-rays were necessary.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/02/00 
 Robinson was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Saturday, three 
days after he was admitted for treatment of back spasms.   Robinson's status 
for Sunday night's game against Green Bay at Soldier Field was downgraded 
from questionable to doubtful. Marty Booker might start in his place, with 
Dez White also seeing increased playing time.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00 
 Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time 
to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put 
him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to 
go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain 
on the active roster until Sunday.   "I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field 
goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals," Wilkins 
said. "It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no 
tweaks."     

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Smith will start at RB at Buffalo this week. He may be a risky start, 
because hamstring injuries sometimes seem to flare up quickly again.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/02/00 
 Fiedler will start Sunday at Buffalo. He was sidelined by a pinched nerve in 
his neck on the first play against the New York Jets on Nov. 19. He returned 
to practice Wednesday.   "Jay looked good today, as he has all week, so he'll 
start," coach Dave Wannstedt said following Friday's workout.    

 Dedric Ward , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Ward caught six passes for 93 yards last week against the Bears. His numbers 
were likely helped due to the loss of rookie Laveranues Coles to an injury. 
Look for Ward to see some passes come his way this week against the Colts, as 
Coles will miss his second consecutive game.  Fantasy owners in deeper 
leagues may want to consider starting Ward this week.    

 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Johnson is listed as probable on the injury report with sore ribs, but he 
will still start this week's game against the Dolphins. He was knocked out of 
last week's game at Tampa Bay, but threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns 
before exiting. Don't expect big numbers from Johnson this week against 
Miami, whose defense ranks seventh in the league against the pass.     

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Cunningham did not practice on Thursday because of a groin strain. His 
status for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers is uncertain.  The Cowboys 
plan to use third string quarterback Anthony Wright to back up Troy Aikman if 
Cunningham isn't ready to play. At this point in the season, no Dallas 
quarterbacks should be considered for your starting lineup.    

 Panthers , DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Not that the Panthers have been a stellar defense for Fantasy owners this 
season, but this week may be a bad time to start Carolina.  The Panthers will 
face a Rams offense that will be pumped up and edgy with the return of QB 
Kurt Warner.  Carolina may get a few interceptions off a rusty Warner but 
look for them to struggle to score Fantasy points against the Rams.  It would 
be wise to use another defense for this week.    

 Martin Gramatica , K TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Gramatica to pile up Fantasy points this week as the Bucs score at 
will against the Cowboys.  He is currently seventh in the NFL in scoring.  
Barring injury, he should be one of the top picks among Fantasy kickers next 
year.    

 Buccaneers , DT TB - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for the Buccaneers to treat QB Troy Aikman like a tackling dummy this 
Sunday.  The Cowboys have failed to protect him against adequate pass rushes 
this season so don't expect them to do any better against the T.B. sack 
machine.  The Buccaneers will be in Aikman's face all day and will force him 
into some turnovers as well.  Fantasy owners that possess the Bucs' defense 
will see them help their team in a major way this week.    

 Ryan Longwell , K GB - Ramiro Updated 12/01/00 
 Look for Longwell to have a big week against the Bears Sunday.  The Packers 
should have no problems gaining yards against the Bears but they may have 
trouble getting into the end zone, giving Longwell some kicking 
opportunities.  He has been successful when given the opportunity connecting 
on 24-of-28 FGs this season.  Look for him to score some points this week and 
be helpful, as far as Fantasy kickers go.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions' thinned secondary took another hit on Thursday as the team lost 
cornerback Bryant Westbrook for the remainder of the season to a torn left 
Achilles tendon. His loss will force Detroit to move nickel back Marquis 
Walker into the starting lineup.  The pass defense should be alright for the 
rest of the season though.  The pass rush has come alive recently forcing the 
QBs to rush their throws.  Detroit also has a favorable schedule with games 
against the Packers, Jets, and Bears.  Teams whose pass offense has struggle 
considerably this season.     

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Holcombe will start at fullback Sunday, but he will also get some carries at 
HB.  At this point in the Fantasy season he will be a good reserve back to 
have.  Just in case the Rams decide to rest Marshall Faulk in the upcoming 
weeks.    

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 So far so good for Wilkins and the Rams.  The kicker went through an intense 
kicking workout Thursday without experiencing any pain in his leg.  If he 
continues to kick without experiencing the slightest twinge he will play 
Sunday at Carolina.  Wilkins could be extremely helpful to Fantasy Owners in 
the last few weeks.  The Rams will get QB Kurt Warner back Sunday and face 
the Panthers and Vikings in their next two games.  Look for the offense to 
explode once again and give Wilkins a lot of opportunities to score points.   
 

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Moore's condition has improved and he has been upgraded to probable for 
Sunday's game against the Broncos.  Moore suffered a stinger against the Rams 
last Sunday and his neck and shoulder have been sore all week.  Give Moore a 
start this Sunday.  He has been an adequate replacement for RB Ricky Williams 
and has been a nice fit behind the Saints' offensive line.      

 Jake Reed , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Reed will practice Friday for the first time since breaking his leg.  He put 
up dismal Fantasy numbers before he injured his leg.  He could be back in 
action before the regular season ends but don't count on him helping out your 
Fantasy team.    

 Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Stecker the Bucs' primary kickoff returner sat out of practice Thursday and 
is not expected to play Sunday.  Tampa has activated WR Frank Murphy from its 
practice squad with intentions of having him handle the kicks.  If returners 
are valuable in your Fantasy league it would be wise for you to pick up a 
healthy return man.    

 Macey Brooks , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Brooks missed practice Thursday due to a lower back strain and is 
questionable for Sunday's game against the Packers.  If Brooks doesn't play 
the Bears will only have four healthy receivers.  This could mean a healthy 
diet of running plays.  It would be wise for Fantasy owners to utilize 
Chicago RBs James Allen and Marlon Barnes considering the health of the Bears 
receivers and Green Bay's recent struggles with its run defense.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 12/01/00 
 Robinson was hospitalized for back spasms Wednesday night and still remained 
in the hospital Thursday night.  He is also suffering from a lower back 
sprain and is not expected to play against the Packers Sunday.  Marty Booker 
and rookie Dez White will alternate in Robinson's spot.  Eddie Kennison will 
probably be used as the primary receiver.  It would be wise to stay away from 
Robinson and the rest of the Chicago passing team this week.    

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/01/00 
 Stewart had a mediocre Fantasy game Thursday carrying 15 times for 67 yards 
and a touchdown.  Look for Stewart to have a better game against the Packers 
next week.  The Packers defensive line is thin without DT Santana Dotson. 
They allowed Carolina rookie Brad Hoover to romp through their front for 117 
yards Monday.     

 Stoney Case , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 Case entered Thursday night's game for Detroit, replacing starter Charlie 
Batch who left after re-aggravating a rib injury. Playing for the injured 
Batch, Case completed 23-of-33 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception, and also ran six times for 62 yards. Case might not be a 
bad acquisition at this point of the season. If Batch can't play next week it 
would be best to plug in his backup. Batch may be the better winner, but 
Case's running ability makes him the better Fantasy QB.    

 Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00 
 The rookie wideout put up the best numbers in a game laced with talented 
receivers.  He caught eight passes for 106 yards and a late touchdown.  Don't 
rush out and try to acquire Foster though.  His numbers were probably more a 
product of his chemistry with fellow second-stringer, QB Stoney Case, who 
filled in for the injured Charlie Batch.  Foster seemed to be Case's first 
throwing option.  When Batch returns Foster will probably be the third option 
again.    

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/01/00 
 Culpepper had a boring Fantasy performance against the Lions Thursday.  He 
threw a touchdown and two interceptions while completing 19-of-32 passes for 
160 yards.  Expect bigger and better numbers for Culpepper when he faces the 
Rams next week in what will probably the biggest offensive explosion of the 
season.      

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/01/00 
 Carter caught seven passes for 45 yards Thursday, including a four-yard 
second quarter touchdown for his 1,000th career  catch.  It was a milestone 
night for Carter but a forgettable one for Fantasy owners.  His numbers 
weren't too spectacular.  Look for him to put up better numbers against the 
Rams and their generous defense next week.    

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 The Lions managed to put the clamps on the star wideout Thursday.  He was 
held to 26 yards on three catches.  Don't worry Fantasy owners.  If your team 
is still in the playoff hunt Moss will make up for his performance next week 
against the Rams.  He is just too talented to be shut down in consecutive 
games.      

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/01/00 
 Smith ran for two touchdowns and 117 yards on 17 carries Thursday night, 
including a 43-yard fourth-quarter TD run that sealed the game for 
Minnesota.  If you have Smith on your Fantasy team he may very well seal a 
Fantasy championship for your team.  He is without a doubt the hottest 
Fantasy back right now.    

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - FDIC Updated 11/30/00 
 Although McNair is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for 
Sunday's game in Philadelphia, he is expected to get the start. His thumb is 
still sore and he's been icing it regularly, but it's not expected to keep 
him from playing. Still, the Eagles have a solid defense and the Titans' 
passing game has struggled of late, so you might want to consider starting 
someone else this week.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/30/00 
 George did not practice yesterday in order to rest his injured right big 
toe, although he and Coach Jeff Fisher said he could have participated. 
Fisher wants George to be able to fully participate in today's session, and 
expects he will be able to. Considering George has held up this well through 
a variety of injuries in recent weeks, there's little reason to expect he 
won't start Sunday in his return to Philadelphia and post solid Fantasy 
numbers.  

 Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/30/00 
 Ward is listed as probable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game 
against Oakland. With Pittsburgh's receivers hurting, expect him to play and 
be the focus of the passing game. He's still marginal as a Fantasy producer, 
though.

a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Cummings will be out indefinitely after suffering  a fractured cheekbone.  
He is scheduled to have plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will play more minutes as the backup point guard in 
his absence.    

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Reserve guard Damon Jones left Monday's game in the first half with a 
concussion.  He is questionable for Wednesday's game against Dallas.    

 Tony Massenburg , F VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Massenburg confirmed reports on Monday that he has asked for a trade. The 
nine-year veteran signed a three-year free-agent contract with Vancouver in 
the off-season. Grizzlies general manager Billy Knight said he is not 
contemplating a deal for Massenburg.  Massenburg is a bruising rebounder but 
will have very little Fantasy value wherever he plays.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Payton has been the ultimate Ironman in his career with the Sonics.  His 
game against Orlando marked the 319th consecutive start for him, dating back 
to March 18, 1996, the longest active streak in the NBA.  The last game he 
missed was March 15, 1996, against Dallas when he served a one-game 
suspension that snapped his career-high consecutive games played streak at 
354.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/08/00 
 McDyess played in Monday's game against Denver despite suffering from back 
spasms.  He played 31 minutes without aggravating his injury, scoring 12 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.     

 Howard Eisley , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 He is backing up Steve Nash at point guard but head coach Don Nelson is 
using Eisley to finish games for Dallas.  Fifty-five percent of Eisley's 
total points and 41 percent of his assists this season have come in the final 
12 minutes of the game.  He scored 10 of his 14 points in Monday's game 
against Denver in the fourth quarter.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Williams missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left 
knee.  He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against 
Phoenix.   Williams will be evaluated on a day to day basis.  For now he is 
questionable for Thursday's game against Vancouver.  Matt Bullard started at 
small forward in his absence.     

 Juwan Howard , F WAS - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Howard took a hard shot to his left eye during Tuesday night's game against 
the Bulls.  He left the floor dazed, but would later return to the game. He 
finished the contest with eight points and ten rebounds.   

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Miller broke his right hand on Tuesday night and could miss up to a month.  
He broke a bone in the base of his hand as he was grabbing a rebound against 
the Wizards. He had five points and eight rebounds in Chicago's 88-83 loss.   
 

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sabonis could be back for part of the Blazers' Eastern Conference swing, 
which begins Monday in New Jersey.  He has missed all four of the Blazers' 
regular season games while he recovers from a knee injury.    

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/07/00 
 Geiger, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, went 
through his first full practice yesterday at the Philadelphia College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.  He is eligible to come off the disabled list after 
tomorrow night's game, but the team hasn't disclosed any definite date as to 
when he will return.    

 Sherman Douglas , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Douglas twisted his left ankle slightly during practice on Monday, but is 
expected to be available tomorrow night when the Nets visit the Wizards. He 
is averaging 7.3 points, 1.0 assists and 1.3 rebounds through three games 
this season.      

 Tom Gugliotta , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Gugliotta went through his first practice on Monday since having major 
recontructive knee surgery eight months ago.  He damaged both his anterior 
cructiate and medial collateral ligaments in a game against Utah last March.  
He hopes to begin playing in games in about two weeks.   

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/07/00 
 The Atlanta Journal Constitution is reporting that Mutombo will definitely 
play on Thursday night against the Suns.  He missed most of the preseason and 
the first four games of the regular season after suffering a mild case of 
malaria.   

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/07/00 
 Sprewell was told to watch what he says about Chris Webber joining the 
Knicks in a meeting with league officials on Monday.  In the meeting, 
officials described exactly what the NBA's tampering rules were, and how they 
apply to players.  No disciplinary action was taken against the Knicks' 
forward.    

 Darvin Ham , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Ham will miss 3-4 months after undergoing foot surgery on Monday.  He 
injured the foot while going up for a rebound against the Pistons on Saturday 
night.  Ham averaged 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in his first 
three games of the season.  He will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
either Tim Thomas or Jason Caffey.      

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/07/00 
 Doctors have cleared Coleman to return to the court for the Hornets on 
Wednesday against the Magic.  He missed the entire preseason while adapting 
to new medication for his irregular heartbeat.  Head Coach Paul Silas said 
that Coleman wouldn't start Wednesday's game, but that he would get some 
playing time.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Celtics on Monday after the team released Greg 
Minor.  He played in 54 games over the past two seasons with the Knicks, and 
was waived by the Miami Heat after this preseason.

As you can probably tell,   Saturday will mostly likely be cold and raining. 

Dress accordingly to stay warm and dry.       I would recommend that you buy 
a cheap plastic poncho, preferrably see-through (at walmart for $2 or less).
Be prepared for whatever the weather has to offer..

Bring your cleats  (no metal cleats) for traction.   If you need cleats,  
Oshman's has good Riddell football shoes for $20 to $35.

Finally, today is the last day to get donations...   so  get  'em..

How's our running plays?   Are we prepared for mud bowl 2000?

Norv Turner Fired   From the article:
http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,3141082_59,00.html   Washington
Redskins coach Norv Turner was fired Monday after failing to live up to
Super Bowl expectations with the most expensive team in NFL history.  Turner
was dismissed by owner Dan Snyder one day after a 9-7 loss to the New York
Giants. It was the fourth loss in five games for the Redskins (7-6) and
third in a row at home, and it moved a team with championship aspirations
precariously close to elimination from the playoff race.
Passing game coordinator Terry Robiskie was named interim coach. He
immediately began holding team meetings for Sunday's game in Dallas.
Turner fought back tears as he said goodbye.
"I've obviously been put in a good position to have an opportunity to win,"
Turner said. "This team has a chance to be 10-6. That's a disappointment to
me. There's part of me that would like to be a part of it. There's part of
me that understands why it's necessary to make a change right now."
Turner, 48, earned a reputation as a master strategist with the Dallas
Cowboys, where he was the offensive coordinator for two Super Bowl teams in
the early 1990s. Some of his game plans in Washington were truly masterful,
but his lack of communication skills and inability to keep players focused
and motivated led to his downfall.
Injuries also slowed the offense. Three starters were lost for the season
and several others played hurt.
The reconstituted offensive line had its worst day Sunday. However, there
were also many unforced errors such as dropped balls, missed blocks and bad
snaps.
Robiskie, 46, becomes the NFL's third black head coach. He is a former
offensive coordinator with the Oakland Raiders and was one of Turner's first
hires in Washington in 1994. He is known for a tough-love coaching style
from his dealings with temperamental Redskins receivers Michael Westbrook
and Albert Connell.
"He might add a little more fire to it," Connell said.
The Redskins also announced Franklin Pepper Rodgers would become vice
president of football operations and tight ends coach Pat Flaherty would
replace LeCharls McDaniel as special teams coach.
Rodgers, a former head coach at Kansas, UCLA and Georgia Tech and at Memphis
of the USFL, will head the team's selection process for a new head coach in
2001.
//////////

My View:  If I'm Turner, I'm happy to be out from under Danny Snyder.
That's all I have to say about that.  From a FF perspective, I wouldn't be
surprised to see the team show an uptick in intensity behind Robiskie.  We
saw it in Arizona and Cincinnati but the difference here will the be the
Redskins have the talent to turn that enthusiasm into productivity on the
field.  In other news, it looks like QB Jeff George gets another start this
weekend after replacing Brad Johnson.  Turner had been Johnson's protecting
saint so the QB move coinciding with the coaching change is not surprising.

See you tonight in our upgrades and downgrades.

Joe

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

If you have 5 minutes today and need a laugh, I offer
the following number.

Democrats set up a toll-free number (1-800-579-8871)
where Florida voters could report irregularities. Feel
free to call and tell them that if the Democratic
Voters are too stupid to figure out the ballot and how
to vote for President, then they shouldn't be allowed
to vote.

I am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in 
Texas.  I was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming 
on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.  
The names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.  
The most important data is MW capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., 
natural gas, coal, etc.)

Do you have this information?

Thanks,

Eric

I still don't have any info on the schedule, but I do need to collect dues 
for the upcoming season. Dues are $5 and that includes a jersey and cost of 
the league.

Let me know if you are still in for the season.

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - Eric Bass Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Hatchette left Sunday's game in the second half after pulling a muscle on 
his side.  Troy Walters replaced Hatchette as the third wideout.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game in the first half with a concussion. He was 
replaced by Anthony Wright. Randall Cunningham is the team's emergency QB 
this week because of his recent groin problems.  

 Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wright replaced an injured Troy Aikman early in the second quarter of 
Sunday's game against Washington.  

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 12/10/00 
 Fiedler suffered an injured left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 
Buccaneers.  The injury seemed to affect his accuracy as he threw four 
interceptions in the game.  Keep an eye on his situation.  The injury may 
warrant you dropping him from your Fantasy lineup next week.       

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 McNair was lifted in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. 
Jeff Fisher replaced him with Neil O'Donnell, deciding McNair needed a 
well-deserved rest to keep him healthy after throwing three TD passes.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/10/00 
 Taylor left Sunday's game against Jacksonville in the third quarter with the 
Jaguars leading 30-3. He seemed to suffer a minor injury to his knee that had 
been bothering him earlier in the year, but he remained on the sidelines and 
appeared to be in good condition.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Greisen replaced an ineffective Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game at Jacksonville.

I hate it when I'm right, Kitna will be benched before week 2.  Garcia is 
still available, but I will need a starting RB - imight be able to swing 
another RB in the deal like Fred Beasley- Or you can start Ryan Leaf

What do you think?

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  Enron once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team Enron once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, Enron 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

Mr. Simmons -

We are holding our own "closed" practices and do not want to show you any of 
our
offensive and defensive packages before Saturday.  Appreciate the invite.....
is our bet for $50 with our team getting 9 points still on?

Professor Webb, 

We would like to have a scrimmage/practice with your team this Wednesday.    
The aggie teams have already held practice as of Sunday and are scrimmaging 
this Wednesday as well  (to which we are not invited).   As they pose the 
greatest hurdle to obtaining the tickets, it is essential that we prepare in 
similar fashion.....

However, we are unable to find a LIGHTED field to practice upon (Memorial is 
unlit)..     


If anyone knows of a lighted field for practice  (Rice University???), please 
contact me ASAP so we can schedule a practice for Wednesday evening.


- Mike  ext  37842


=== 

Webb, I'm counting on you not to let the Longhorn tradition down....

Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. "The end 
zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that some of the touchdowns 
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored 
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous". "They agreed to the size, 
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach Bob 
Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so before we 
started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the outcome.  
Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as 
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We 
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of 
the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones 
were used. "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost," 
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing 
signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!" Students' thoughts echoed 
their signs. "All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a 
winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a 
winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner, 
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30 
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that with a 
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were 
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our 
prediction."

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's "full disclosure" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

Dale,

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 


In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Thanks for your help.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't 
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be 
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you 
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in 
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

Let me know

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 13th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairly =
far=20
down the  list of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

?

QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den)? You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performin=
g=20
like he did.? Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things oft=
en=20
happen.? When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage=
,=20
great things happen.? Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues=
=20
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers.? With guys like Kurt Warner=
=20
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs=
=20
come from great teams.? Not  always the case as Collins is showing.? Often=
=20
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco=
=20
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up.? Collins looks comfortab=
le=20
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike=20
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB)? He's  baaaaack.? I said last week that Favre coming ba=
ck=20
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy an=
d=20
Favre delivered.? 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and=20
believing they can?make some  noise.? WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an=20
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey=20
Levens.?=20

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was=
=20
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake.? He was not a #2 QB=
=20
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute.? Brooks=
=20
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely.? He's skinny at #205 b=
ut=20
tall (6' 4")? Big  league arm and nice mobility.? Of particular note was hi=
s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with "new" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

Well, we are supposed to have a game tonight at 7:30 - with the weather, 
though, I don't know where that stands.
Assuming the weather clears up, please let me know whether or not you will 
make it tonight.

=09 Q: I noticed you mentioned in one of your articles that Texas was still=
=20
trying to put together its first complete game of the season. I couldn't=20
agree more. I don't recall a season where we really haven't played a good=
=20
game yet this late in the season, especially given the talent we are puttin=
g=20
on the field. I'm also concerned about the number of penalties we are=20
committing. I've read that Mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and emotion=
,=20
but I watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and remain=20
disciplined. Do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just youth?=
=20
=09?? Ken Hines, Wichita Falls=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes told me this week that the team thought i=
t=20
would go out to Stanford and win easily. In other words, the team took the=
=20
Cardinal lightly. Thus, when the Cardinal played the Longhorns tough (and=
=20
ultimately won), Texas got tight and struggled. I think this season has bee=
n=20
one with little to get up for. The teams on UT's schedule were - for the mo=
st=20
part - awful. Texas knew going into the season that it was going to be at=
=20
least a 10-point favorite in every game except for Oklahoma and Texas A&M.=
=20
The Longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record - Texas Tech.=
=20
My point is, once Texas suffered the shock of losing to Stanford, it lost=
=20
some of its sense of urgency. Its dream of a national title - realistic or=
=20
unrealistic - was over. By the time Texas played Oklahoma, the Longhorns ha=
d=20
played only a couple halves of complete football - the second half against=
=20
Louisiana-Lafayette and the second half against Oklahoma State. That wasn't=
=20
nearly enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the Sooners. F=
or=20
whatever reason (some will argue it was the QB rotation), the offensive=20
coaches weren't able to instill an identity or swagger into their players.=
=20
Whether this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because the=
=20
team couldn't get up for the Houstons and Baylors of the world, only the=20
coaches and players really know. But, in my opinion, Texas has not yet put =
a=20
complete game together - nine games into the season. And it's because of th=
e=20
offense. The defense has been solid with the exception of Oklahoma. The=20
offense has been slow starting, erratic and even predictable. To UT's credi=
t,=20
the offense is about to set a single-season passing yardage record by=20
averaging 289.4 yards passing per game. If Texas wins its next two games an=
d=20
wins its bowl game, the Longhorns would be 10-2 and that would be an=20
improvement over last year and hard to argue with. So, perhaps Texas can ta=
ke=20
the fire it showed in the first quarter against Tech and put its first=20
complete game together this week. A three-game winning streak to end the=20
season would be a great launch pad into next season, when UT will again hav=
e=20
a chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling dummies.=20

rns'=20
immediate holiday plans: either the Orange Bowl, if all goes perfectly, or=
=20
more likely the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego. Do you think Mack Brown=

=20
for great TV, and a wonderful trip for the 'Horns and their many fans.=20
=09?? James K. Sterrett=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is a better question for next week because we'll know the=
=20
outcome of the Texas A&M-Oklahoma game. If Oklahoma and Nebraska both win o=
ut=20
and meet in the Big 12 title game, a narrow Nebraska win would probably lan=
d=20
both in a BCS bowl game. A narrow Oklahoma win might still land them both i=
n=20
the BCS. But a lopsided win by either Oklahoma or Nebraska would probably=
=20
mean the winner going to a BCS bowl game and the loser going to the Cotton.=
=20
If A=02?loses to Oklahoma and UT beats Kansas, the winner of the UT-A=02?ga=
me would=20
probably be playing for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo=
=20
Bowl. The Holiday Bowl opponent would appear to be either Oregon State or=
=20
Washington. The Alamo Bowl opponent would appear to be either Michigan or=

Ohio State. I think any of those opponents would probably catch the attenti=

of Texas, except for maybe Oregon State, which is really good.=20

always been my opinion that referees' calls were  just part of the game and=
=20
if you're not good enough to overcome some bad  calls, well, you're just no=

good enough. That said, however, we seem to  have some of the worst calls=

going against us in the last few years and in  almost every game. Are the=

penalties. =20

talk about the penalties being called because he'll be fined by the Big 12,=
=20
he can complain to the officials on the field. And he can send a videotape =

calls that he thinks are questionable to the league office. And let's just=
=20
say Brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this season.=
=20
Brown is calling for instant replay in the college game. He said the NFL's=
=20

=09Q: Is there anything physically wrong with Kenny Hayter that is limiting=

playing time? Or is this just the coaching staff's decision? I will be one =
of=20
the many to admit that Hodges Mitchell and the offensive line have looked a=
=20
lot better over the past four games. If Hayter had better per-carry numbers=
=20
than Mitchell with an underperforming offensive line, it would seem to me=
=20
that Hayter would also do well now that they are blocking better. I would=
=20
like to point out that I do not advocate benching Mitchell by any means, bu=
t=20
after this week's game and all of the talk I have heard about him being=20
durable or not, I think that a more balanced backfield would help out in th=
is=20
situation. =20
=09?? Jason Patton=20
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  The coaches have stuck with Mitchell because he is a senior lea=
der=20
on an offense that doesn't have many leaders and because he is such a=20
versatile threat as a running back and receiver. Mitchell has suddenly=20
climbed within 235 yards of a 1,000-yard rushing season (765 yards) and has=
=20
337 yards receiving (he'll surpass last year's 343 yards receiving). Mitche=
ll=20
has a 4.7-yard per carry average, the best on the team among RBs except for=
=20
Brett Robin, who has just five carries for 27 yards (5.4 yards per carry).=
=20
The coaches will stick with Mitchell from here on in because the offense=20
finally showed against Tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first hal=
f=20
of a game. Now, granted, it was against an undersized defensive line that=
=20
emphasized its quickness over bulk. But Mack Brown seems to think his team =
is=20
finally getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line of=20
scrimmage. Kansas has a salty defensive line, led by NG Nate Dwyer (6-3,=20
300). So, we'll see if the Longhorns' offensive line can continue to push=

redshirt status for next year?=20
=09?? Monte Boothe=20

=09 BROWN:  It's too early to tell. Mack Brown said he had a conversation w=
ith=20
Simms about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could seriousl=
y=20
be considered is after spring practice, if not next fall.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: It seems that many Horn fans are still in shock from the 63-14 debac=
le in=20
the Cotton Bowl and are wondering if OU is suddenly that far ahead of Texas=
=20
in the development of their respective programs. Are they? Or was this just=
 a=20
total meltdown by a young UT team? Can we expect better results next year a=
nd=20
if so, why?=20
=09?? Mark, Lewisville=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the OU coaches deserve a lot of credit for getting thei=
r=20
players to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both side=
s=20
of the ball. That kind of coaching job is what it's all about. But I don't=
=20
think you can underestimate the influence that Josh Heupel has had on that=
=20
team. He makes every part of that offense effective. Tremendous credit goes=
=20
to the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on tea=
ms=20
like Texas, Kansas State and Nebraska. This has been a phenomenal coaching=
=20
job. And no disrespect to OU, but next year, without Heupel, I think they=
=20
will drop off slightly (maybe 8-3). Maybe not. But it seems likely.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I thought Mack Brown's philosophy on redshirts is that he will take =
them=20
off ANY player at ANY point in the season if we need that player to help us=
=20
win. Does having Beau Trahan as the backup QB for Kansas give us a better=
=20
chance of winning the game (if Simms goes down) than Chance Mock? From what=
=20
Mack says, Mock is not even a consideration (since Courtnee Garcia is the=
=20
emergency QB).=20
=09?? Glen Shillinglaw, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think Brown is banking on the fact that Simms survives the Ka=
nsas=20
game and Major comes back to start or at least back up Simms in an emergenc=
y=20
situation against Texas A&M. On Tuesday, Mack Brown announced that Hunter=
=20
McWilliams, and not WR Courtnee Garcia, would be the team's third=20
quarterback. McWilliams, the son of former UT coach David McWilliams, runs=
=20
the scout team QB position in practice and has more experience handing off=
=20
this season than Garcia, who was an option QB at Lufkin. Brown said he woul=
d=20
take the redshirt off of Mock if he absolutely had to, meaning if both Simm=
s=20
and Applewhite went down with season-ending injuries. But he said to do so=
=20
right now would be premature because Simms is OK, and there's a chance that=
=20
Applewhite will be back for A&M.=20
=09?

=09 Q: Is there any chance for Texas to take the Big 12 South? Hopefully A=

OU this weekend, this can't hurt. =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Oklahoma would have to lose two of its last three games at Texa=

Hi Folks,
?
Careening toward the week 11 games as we try to  keep you on top of all the 
latest happenings.
?
Before we jump to this week's Updated Players in  the News, I wanted to let 
you know we've updated the Target  numbers.? Understanding how many times a 
player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how 
an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.? You can find the WR targets 
here http://www.cheatsheets.net/wrtargets.htm?and  the TE numbers here 
http://www.cheatsheets.net/tetargets.htm??  Enjoy.
?
Joe
?
?
?
News galore....let's jump into  it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl)  is doubtful with a concussion. He has not practiced 
all week. QB Danny  Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is  expected to sit another week with a sore shoulder. 
Doug Flutie gets the start  again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will  not play this week. Jim 
Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug  Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give him 
the  quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal)  practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected 
to start this  week. If he cannot go because of his back, Cliff Stoerner 
would start. Randall  Cunningham is also hurt with a sore knee and has not 
practiced.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Coach Dave Campo says he'll wait 
until Sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.? We expect it to be 
Aikman, but given this  uncertainty, I'd look elsewhere for a QB.
?
QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to  play through his ailments. This week will 
be no different.

QB  Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is expected  to 
start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is  expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to team, 
Maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not  appear on the injury report, but has a 
sore knee. He is expected to start this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and  did not practice on 
Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play  or not. John 
Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could also  use 
Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a situation you should  
avoid if at all possible.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)  continues to draw conflicting 
information. Some say he's looking a  little more likely to start Sunday.? 
Others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.? Even 
if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.? I'd look 
elsewhere if you can.

QB  Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played through  it 
the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh  (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not start. The 
team named  Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard  (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected to sit 
this  week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL)  is out for another 2-3 weeks.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Kurt Warner  (StL)? St. Louis Post Dispatch is 
reporting Warner will have the  pins removed from his finger Tuesday.? 
Remember early on that Warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were 
removed.? Most feel that's way too  optimistic but expect to hear a lot about 
this soon.

QB Shaun  King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday. He  
practiced on Thursday. 

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will  likely be added today to the injury report with a 
sore back. He expects to play  on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this  week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Running Backs  in the News:

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore  knee. He did not practice 
on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo  (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) will likely play although 
Sam Gash will be the  starter.? Keep an eye on Ayandbadejo as he quietly had 
some very productive  weeks early in the season.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf)  returned to practice and will play this week.

RB  Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to play  
with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka's (Car) outlook has dimmed?a 
little as he was  downgraded to Questionable.? He wasn't able to practice any 
this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.? If he can't go, Brad 
Hoover will  start at Tailback.? Yes, that would be the undrafted Fullback 
Brad  Hoover...

RB Brandon Bennett (Cin) is healthy enough to  play this weekend. He will 
backup Corey Dillon.

RB Jamel White  (Cle) is expected to cut into Travis Prentice's carries this  
week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) is expected to play with a  sore ankle.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) was able to  practice and will play this week.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB)  is likely out for the rest of the year. Ahman Green 
will start in his  absence.

RB Shyrone Stith (Jac) missed Wednesday's  practice, but heexpects to play if 
needed.

RB Ricky Williams (NO)  is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

RB Joe  Montgomery (NYG) is listed as questionable and did not practice  
Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets  continue to list 100 players on 
the injury report. He will start on  Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles  and was held out of 
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week,  but looks as if 
he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-time  decision which 
is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will keep you posted  regarding 
any breaking news regarding his status.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Tyrone  Wheatley (Oak) was unable to practice 
Saturday according to ESPN's John  Clayton.? He could still play Monday as 
he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.? I'm very leery though.? If I 
had another comprable  back, I'd go there this week.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is  expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but isexpected to start 
on  Sunday.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) skipped Wednesday's  practice, but ishopeful of 
playing on Sunday.

RB Fred Beasley  (SF) is doubtful with a sprained ankle. He has not  
practiced.

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) is out for another 3  weeks.

*** Saturday Update? RB Trung Canidate  (StL) is rumored to be making his 
first appearance this week.?  I'll be interested to see how he affects 
Watson's playing time.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a  sore hamstring, but expects to play. He is 
listed as questionable on the injury  report.

RB Eddie George (Ten) is banged up with a sore  knee and toe. But look for 
the iron-man to suit and play on Sunday.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten)  went through the Saturday walk 
through today and looks to start.?  

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will use the bye week to heal  his sprained wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Wide  Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore  hamstring, but is expected to play. 

WR Tim Dwight (Atl)  will be downgraded to questionable on Friday's injury 
report. He has  sore ribs and could be a game-time decision.

gone.?  

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

this week.

WR Corey Bradford  (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad strain. He 
has not  practiced and is doubtful for this week.

this  week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his  stiff neck and will play 
this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)  used the bye week to get healthier. He is expected to 
play this  week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia)  is expected to play this week with a sore foot. He will 
not start  though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be the  starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract  extension. "She" should be 
there for many years to come.

WR Jake  Reed (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

WR Ron Dixon  (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play  with his sore shoulder.

sore quadricep. He is listed as  questionable on the injury report.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  practiced Friday and looks like 
he'll play at least  some.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and  Thursday'spractices with a very 
tender toe. He's listed as questionable and  could be
a game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra  action if 
Owens can not go.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Terrell Owens  (SF) took part in about 70% of 
Friday's practice.? Coach Steve  Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not 
starting Owens Sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.? 
The amount he could play will be  determined by how Owens feels at gametime.? 
This is so tough to call as  he's one of the elite WRs in the game and 50% of 
Terrell Owens is better than  100% of lots of other WRs.? People always want 
numbers so here's my  opinion:? 
Chances he doesn't play at all:?  25%
Chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50%
Chances he plays and looks like the Owens we've  been seeing: 25%
Weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your 
team and situation.? He's a high risk, high  reward decision this week.? If 
you're pretty well set and just need a few  points out of your WR slot, I'd 
probably bench him and find another guy.?  If you need to swing for the 
fences, I'd probably be inclined to gamble on him  and keep your fingers 
crossed.? 

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the  least hurt of all the receivers and will start 
on Sunday. He is battling a sore  back and ankle. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten)  is listed as questionable on the injury report, but 
expects to start  with his sore back and ribs. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as 
questionable  this week. For those that have followed his career, this 
usually means he will  not play. 
?
***Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) surprised us and put together 3 
solid days of practice at the end  of the week.? Coach Fisher was even 
talking about the Titans taking some  shots downfield and Thigpen figuring 
into the gameplan.? We've heard this  before so be careful.? 

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is  still bothered by a hamstring and was not able to 
practice at full speed. He is  not likely to make much of an impact this week.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Carl Pickens (Ten)  is inactive for this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA)  was signed by  Washington.

//////////////////////////////////////

Tight  Ends in the News:

TE Chris Gedney (Ari) has sore ribs, but is  expected to play. He practiced 
on Wednesday and Thursday.

TE  Derek Brown signed with Arizona.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)  will likely be held out one more week with his ailing 
shoulder. Casey  Crawford gets the start at tight end now that Wesley Walls 
is lost for the  year.

*** Saturday Update? TE David Sloan  (Det) was added to the injury report 
with a hamstring injury and is  questionable according to my friend Steve 
Cohen of Pro Football News and Injury  Report.? He's a gametime decision now.
?
*** Saturday Update? TE Tyrone Davis  (GB) has a torn rotator cuff that will 
require surgery in the  offseason.? In the meantime, he's falling behind 
Bubba Franks for the  primary TE job.

TE Eric Bjornson (NE) has lost  his starting job to Rod Rutledge.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)  is expected to play with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Anthony Becht's  (NYJ) prospects are looking better 
with Fred Baxter's injury.?  
?
TE Freddie Jones (SD) has turf  toe, but is expected to play through the pain.

TE Stephen  Alexander (Was) is on a bye this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Kickers in  the News:

PK Matt Stover (Bal) has a sore finger, but it will  not keep him from 
kicking on Sunday.

PK Mike Vanderjagt (Ind)  inked a five year contract extension.

PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on Monday. He 
is listed  as questionable, but has not practiced. The Raiders have looked at 
Brett Conway  and Chris Boniol, but have not signed either one. We will watch 
this one close  for you Friday and Saturday.
?
*** Saturday Update? PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) is still not 100%.? He 
tested his foot today and  according to ESPN's John Clayton, the results were 
less than encouraging.?  He may still go but I'd look elsewhere this week.

PK Jeff Wilkens  (StL) is expected to handle FGs this week. Jeff Hall was 
signed earlier  in the week and will perform kickoffs and is the backup to 
Wilkens if he can't  kick.

PK Eddie Murray (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Scott Bentley (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Kris Heppner (Was) was released after his  several miscues cost the team a 
victory this past week.

Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this 
and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?

Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior 
to the draft.  I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan 
and trade your picks.

Let me know.

Eric

Hi Folks,

Lots of news so let's jump right  into it.
?
Joe
?
Quarterbacks in the  News:
?
QB  Rob Johnson (Buf) is listed as questionable, but he is not expected to 
play. QB  Doug Flutie will start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update? Buffalo  QBs.? This could get ugly.? Johnson said he 
felt that  anonymous negative comments made in the Sports Illustrated article 
were made by  Flutie.? It's still my contention that Flutie is playing for?a  
starting job from here on out.? If he plays well Sunday and the Bills win,  
Johnson had better be for finding a baseball cap he's comfortable with.?  

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is out with a bad shoulder. Jim Miller  starts?in his 
absence.
?
QB Troy Aikman (Dal) will sit with his sore back.  Randall Cunningham will 
take over the reins this week.

QB Brian Griese  (Den) was arrested for driving under the influence. This is 
not expected to  cause any problems for the remainder of this season.

QB Mark Brunell  (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with  his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his  sore neck. Look for 
the same this week.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) practiced with  the second team. He will likely back up Jim 
Harbaugh for the remainder of the  season.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not expected to play this week. Jon Kitna  returns to 
the starting job.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out with a broken  pinkie. Trent Green starts in his 
absence.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)  practiced Thursday and is expected to start.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) will  miss at least this week's game. He could be out 
from 2-4 weeks. Jeff George gets  the start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Brad Johnson (Was)  is looking like his knee injury 
could be more serious than originally  thought. He has a?"significant" (grade 
2) tear of his MCL in his left knee  that is close to being a complete tear 
which is a grade 3.? This will get  very interesting if Jeff George plays  
well.

?

good for Sunday.?  

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) returned to practice this week, but the team has  not 
commented whether he will rejoin the team this season or not.

play  through the pain. He is holding off surgery until the end of the  
season.
?

You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

-Eric

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

-Mike  ext 37842


--
Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

Subject: Bush's Testimony


 The founder of the (web?)site said he called
Gore and  Bush  andasked them to send in their
testimonies for the web site-since they BOTH
"claim" to be Christians.
 Gore's office said that he didn't have one in
typed  form - but Bush did.
Here it is...please pass this along!
 Very Important!!! This could change America.
 (Whether Democrat or Republican)
 If any of you are interested in what George Bush
says about his faith, here it is.
 (Alex Mooney, State Senator)
 From George W. Bush:
 "Actually, the seeds of my decision had been
planted  the year before, by the Reverend Billy Graham.
He visited my family for a summer weekend in Maine.
I saw him preach at the small summer church,
St. Ann's by the Sea.  We all had lunch on the patio
overlooking theocean. One evening my dad asked Billy
to answer questions from a big group of family
gathered for the weekend. He sat by the fire and
talked.
  And what he said sparked a change in my heart. I
don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of
his example. The Lord was so clearly reflected in his
gentle and loving demeanor. The next day we walked
and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the
presence of a great man.  He was like a magnet; I  felt
drawn to seeksomething different. He didn't lecture
or admonish; he shared warmth and concern. Billy Graham
didn't make you feel guilty;  he made you feel  loved.
Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham
planted a mustard seed in  mysoul, a seed that grew
over the next year. He  led me to the path, and I  began
walking.
  It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had
always been a "religious" person, had regularly
attended church, even taught Sunday School.
But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning. It
was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit
my heart to Jesus Christ.
 I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to
die for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that
through the Son, I could find God's amazing grace,
a grace that crosses every border, every barrier and
is open to everyone.
 Through the love of Christ's life, I could understand
the life changing powers of faith.
  When I returned to Midland, I began reading the
Bible regularly.  Don Evans  talked me into joining him
and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community
Bible study. The group had first assembled the year before,
in Spring of 1984, at the beginning of the downturn in the
energy industry.   Midland was hurting. A lot of people
were looking for comfort and strength and direction.
A couple of men started  the Bible study as a support group,
and it grew. By the time I began attending, in the fall of
1985, almost 120 men would gather. We met in small
discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the
larger group for full meetings.
  Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings.
I remember looking forward to them. My interest in
reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger,
and the words became clearer and more meaningful.
We studied Acts, the story of the Apostles building the
Christian Church, and next year, the Gospel of Luke. The
preparation for each meeting took several hours,
reading the Scripture passages and thinking through
responses to discussion questions. I took it seriously,
with my usual touch of humor....Laura and I were active
members of the First Methodist Church of Midland,
and we participated in many family programs,including
James Dobson's Focus on the Family series on raising children.
As I studied and learned, Scripture took on greater meaning,
and gained confidence and understanding in my faith.
I read the Bible regularly.  Don Evans gave me the
"one-year" Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings,
each one including a section from the New Testament, the Old
Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. I read through that Bible \
every other year. During the years in between, I pick
different chapters to study at different times.
I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for
guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for
heavenly things,for wisdom and patience and understanding.
My faith gives me focus and perspective.It teaches humility.
But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in
the political process. Faith is an important part
of my life. I believe it is important to live my faith,
not flaunt it.
 America is a great country because of our religious
freedoms. It is important for any leader to respect
the faith of others. That point was driven home when
Laura and I visited Israel in 1998. We had traveled to
Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was
attending a school program there, and spent three days in
Israel on the way home. It was an incredible experience.
I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening
the curtains and seeing the Old City before us,
the Jerusalem stone glowing gold. We visited the \
Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the
hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.
It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot
where the most famous speech in the history of the world
was delivered, the spot where Jesus outlined the
character and conduct of a believer and gave
his disciples and the world the beatitudes, the
golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer.
 Our delegation included four gentile governors,
one Methodist, two Catholics, and a Mormon, and several
Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we read
Scripture. I chose to read "Amazing Grace," my favorite
hymn. Later that night we all gathered at a
restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded
our middle-of-night flight back to America. We talked
about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides
and government officials who had introduced us to
their country.
 And toward the end of the meal, one of our friends
rose to share a story, to tell us how he, a gentile, and
his friend, a Jew, had (unbeknownst to the rest of us)
walked down to the Sea of Galilee,joined hands underwater,
and prayed together, on bended knee.
 Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as
a child, a hymn he hadn't thought about in years.
He got every word right:
         Now is the time approaching,
         by prophets long foretold,
         when all shall dwell together,
         One Shepherd and one fold.
         Now Jew and gentile, meeting,
         from many a distant shore,
         around an altar kneeling,
         one common Lord.

 Faith changes lives. I know, because faith has
changed mine." Icould not be governor if I did not
believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human
plans. Politics is a fickle business. Polls change.
Today's friend is tomorrow's adversary. People lavish
praise and attention. Many times it is genuine;
sometimes it is not. Yet I build my life on a
foundation that will not shift. My faith frees me.
Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper
perspective. Frees me to make decisions that others
might not like. Frees me to try to do the right
thing, even though it may not poll well...
The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters
as well as its opponents.
 I have a reverence for life; my faith teaches that
life is a gift from our Creator. In a perfect world, life
is given by God and only taken by God. I hope someday
our society will respect life, the full spectrum of life,
from the unborn to the elderly. I hope someday unborn
children will be protected by law and welcomed in life.
I support the death penalty because I believe,
if administered swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a
deterrent against future violence and will save
other innocent lives. Some advocates of life will
challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the
death penalty.  To me, it's the difference between
innocence andguilt.
 Today, two weeks after Jeb's inauguration, in my
church in downtown Austin, Pastor Mark Craig,
was telling me that my re-election was the first
Governor to win back-to-back, four-year terms in
the history of theState of Texas.
 It was a beginning, not an end.... People are starved
for faithfulness. He talked of the need for honesty in
government. He warned that leaders who cheat on their
wives will cheat their country, will cheat
their colleagues, will cheat themselves.
 Pastor Craig said that America is starved for
honest leaders. He told the story of Moses,
asked by God to lead his people to a land of
milk and honey.  Moses had a lot of reasons to
shirk the task. As the Pastor told it, Moses'
basic reaction was, "Sorry, God, I'm busy. I've got a
family. I've got sheep to tend. I've got a life.
"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring
the sons of Israel out of Egypt? The people won't
believe me, he protested.  I'm not a very good
speaker. Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person,
"Moses pleaded. But God did not, and Moses ultimately
did His bidding, leading his people through forty
years of wilderness and wandering, relying on God for
strength and direction and inspiration.
  "People are starved for leadership, "Pastor Craig
said, "starved for leaders who have ethical and moral
courage." "It is not enough to have an ethical
compass to know right from wrong,"  he argued.
"America needs leaders who have the moral courage
to do what is right for the right reason.
It's not always easy or convenient for leaders to step
forward," he acknowledged. "Remember, even Moses
had doubts." "He was talking to you," my mother
later said. The pastor was, of course,talking
to all of us, challenging each one of us to make
the most of our lives, to assume the mantle of
leadership and responsibility wherever we find it.
He was calling on us to use whatever power we have,
in business, in politics, in our communities, and
in our families, to do good for the right reason.
And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my
life.... There was no magic moment of decision.
  After talking with my family during the Christmas
holidays, then hearing this rousing sermon,
to make most of every moment, during my inaugural
church service, I gradually felt more comfortable
with the prospect of a presidential campaign.
 My family would love me, my faith would sustain
me, no matter what. "During the more than half century of
my life, we have seen an unprecedented decay in
our American culture, a decay that has eroded the
foundations of our collective values and moral
standards of conduct.
 Our sense of personal responsibility has declined
dramatically, just as the role and responsibility
of the federal government have increased.
The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast
between right and wrong and created a new standard
of conduct: 'If it feels good,do it.'
and 'If you've got a problem, blame somebody else'.
"Individuals are not responsible for their actions,"
the new culture has said. "We are all victims of
forces beyond our control." We have gone from a culture of
sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with
grabbing all the gusto. We went from accepting
responsibility to assigning blame.
As government did more and more, individuals
were required to do less and less. >The new culture said:
if people were poor, the government should feed them.
If someone had no house, the government should provide one.
If criminals are not responsible for their acts,
then the answers are not prisons, but social programs....
"For our culture to change, it must change one heart, one soul,
and one conscience at a time. Government can spend
money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a
sense of purpose in our lives."... "But government should
welcome the active involvement of people who are following a
religious imperative to love their neighbors through after
school programs, child care, drug treatment,
maternity group homes, and a range of other services.
Supporting these men and women - the soldiers in
the armies of compassion - is the next bold step of
welfare reform, because I know that changing hearts
will change our entire society."
  "During the opening months of my presidential
campaign, I have traveled our country and my heart has been
warmed. My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the
greatness of Americans. They have reminded me that
societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down.
 Everywhere I go, I see people of love and faith,
taking time to help a neighbor in need... These people and
thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of
America. And I want to do my part. I am running for
President because I believe America must seize this moment,
America must lead. We must give our prosperity a
greater purpose, a purpose of peace and freedom and hope. We are a
great nation of good and loving people.
And together, we have a charge to keep."

COMMISSIONERS, REMEMBER TO SET YOUR PLAYOFF MATCHUPS

When your league's regular season ends, the site will not
generate your playoff schedule automatically. The
commissioner must set the playoff matchups manually by

entering the matchups. Nothing else needs to be changed.
Once the commissioner enters the matchups, all owners can
view them on the Schedule, Playoffs page.


CONSOLATION MATCHUPS DURING PLAYOFF WEEKS

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. So why leave the
non-playoff teams on the sidelines? Commissioners can set
not only the playoff matchups, but consolation matchups as
well, under the Schedule, Matchups link in the Front
Office.


PLAYOFF INFORMATION

Go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoff
tournament starts and how many rounds it lasts. If you were
lucky " make that skillful " enough to make the playoffs,
go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams
with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which
players will be available for you.

PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS FROM OUR FANTASY "GURU"

Take a break from pre-game trash talking and let our "guru"
have a say. Go to Schedule, CommGuru for a "tale of the
tape," comparing your starters to your opponent's, position
by position. The "guru" will predict the winner of the
matchup and a final score. In addition to adding spice to
your trash talking, it could also help you decide who to
start and who to bench. Tweak your lineup and go back to
see if the guru's prediction changes. If so, you may want
to consider changing your lineup accordingly. Of course,
the guru isn't perfect, but he can help you with those
tough decisions.


CUSTOMIZE YOUR REPORT SETTINGS

Did you know you can customize the settings of most
reports on the site, and save those settings so they are
displayed each time you visit the report? For example,
suppose you'd like the Transactions, View report to display
only Add/Drops over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter
those settings, click GO and then click the "save" icon
displayed over the report. Now each time you go to
Transactions, View, the report is displayed according to
your custom settings.

Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. "The end
zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous". "They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the
outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many
times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. "All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our
prediction."

Hi Mom,

Where are we staying in Telluride again?  I have been looking at some 
restaurants on telluride.org - it looks like they have some nice places.  
Maybe we should look into doing a sleigh ride or snowmobile dinner outing one 
night.

-Eric

You will get reimbursed once you have taken the exam.  After you have done

Hey Dad,

Mom wrote a note to me about your impending surgery.  What is the skinny?  Is 
this any different from the other skin cancers that you get removed?

How are things otherwise? 

Love,

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Rex Chapman , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Chapman announced his retirement Monday because of a series of injuries.  He 
underwent surgery on his right wrist before training camp and began the 
season on the injured list.  Chapman is also scheduled to have ankle surgery 
soon.     

 Todd Day , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Day was activated from the injured list Friday.  Guard Sam Jacobsen was 
placed on the list to make room for Day.  Day was a key reserve for the Suns 
in 1999-2000 but was sidelined for the first few weeks this season due to a 
knee injury.  He will be a valuable reserve for the T'Wolves as well but 
won't help a Fantasy team too much.     

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Skinner was placed on the injured list after hurting his ankle.  Zendon 
Hamilton was activated to replace Skinner on the roster.  Skinner has been 
somewhat of a disappointment this season averaging 5.8 points and 4.7 
rebounds per game.     

 Jeff McInnis , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 McInnis is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nets after 
suffering a bruised knee against the Sonics Saturday.  Rookie Keyon Dooling 
is expected to get his first start at point guard for the Clippers.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Williams played 26 minutes in Saturday's game against the Suns, scoring four 
points and grabbing seven rebounds.  He had missed Thursday's game against 
the Hornets because of a hip and groin injuries.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Del Negro played eight minutes in Sunday's loss to the Knicks.  He had 
missed the Warriors previous two games due to a sprained ankle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Buckner re-injured his right foot and is expected to be sidelined for at 
least a week.  Hubert Davis is expected to start at shooting guard in his 
absence.    

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Dickerson is not expected to play in Monday's game against the Nuggets due 
to a sprained ankle.  Look for veteran Kevin Edwards to start at shooting 
guard in his place.    

 Doug West , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 West's strained right shoulder has healed and head coach Sidney Lowe is 
expected to activate him from the injured list this week.  Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 
is expected to be placed on the injured list to make room for West.  

 Shareef Abdur-Rahim , F VAN - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/20/00 
 Abdur-Rahim is expected to play in Monday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Saturday's game to be with his sick mother in Atlanta.  If he doesn't 
make it back to Vancouver in time rookie Stromile Swift could get a rare 
start at small forward.    

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 MacCulloch was placed on the injured list Monday with an ankle injury.  With 
the return of Matt Geiger, MacCulloch's already low Fantasy value diminishes 
even further.     

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/20/00 
 Geiger has been activated off the injured list, and could see some playing 
time in tonight's game in Boston.  With Geiger's return, the Sixers placed 
center Todd McCulloch on the injured list.  If you have Geiger on your 
Fantasy roster, give him some time to get back into game shape before putting 
him in your starting lineup.    

 Tim Thomas , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Thomas disclosed on Saturday that he is having some real discomfort in his 
left knee, and it is getting worse with each game that he plays. Thomas has 
started off slow, but didn't want to use the injury as an excuse.  "It's very 
painful at times," said Thomas. "The only thing I can do is keep getting rest 
as much as possible."  The Bucks can ill-afford to lose Thomas; they have 
already lost starting forward Darvin Ham and backup forward Scott Williams 
this season.  If Thomas is on your Fantasy squad, it might be a good idea to 
keep in on the bench until his condition improves.      

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Jones has missed three straight games with a right calf sprain, but says 
that he expects to play on Wednesday night against Cleveland. Jones has 
averaged 16.9 points through his first seven games in Miami.     

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/20/00 
 Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday night against the 
Rockets, but he's not making any promises.  He was suppose to return to 
action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him to wait a bit 
longer before hitting the court.  If Rose is on your roster, give him at 
least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 The Detroit Pistons announced on Monday morning that they had come to terms 
with Smith, on what is believed to be a one-year deal for the NBA's mid-level 
exception of $2.25 million (pro-rated after 11 games).  Smith had reportedly  
agreed to re-sign with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum 
of $611,000 last week.  He will eventually be the Pistons starting center but 
will probably spend the next few weeks inmproving his conditioning.  There is 
no need to rush and try to acquire Smith.  He has been a solid reserve 
at-best throughout his career.  If you have him on your Fantasy team wait 
awhile before you insert him into your lineup.     

 Marcus Camby , C NY - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/20/00 
 Camby turned his ankle during Friday night's victory in Phoenix. X-rays 
taken on his ankle were negative, then Camby underwent an MRI as a 
precautionary measure. He missed Sunday night's game against the Warriors, 
and is listed as day to day.       

 Tim Hardaway , G MIA - The Old School Fools Updated 11/19/00 
 Hardaway, plagued by knee ailments for the past two seasons, sat out 
Saturday night's game against the Portland Trail Blazers with tendinitis in 
his right knee. Hardaway said he expects to play in Miami's next game 
Wednesday against Cleveland.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 O'Neal, bothered by a sprained left ankle and a sore Achilles' tendon, was 
not in uniform Saturday night as the Los Angeles Lakers played the Denver 
Nuggets.  His status is day-to-day.  O'Neal said he was injured when someone 
fell on his leg in the first quarter of Thursday night's overtime victory at 
Sacramento. Greg Foster took O'Neal's place in the starting lineup.     

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/19/00 
 Coleman, who missed the entire preseason because of an irregular heartbeat, 
was placed on the injured list Saturday so he can improve his conditioning.   
The move comes after Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas complained about the 
power forward's weight   

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Nesby made his fifth consecutive start at shooting guard for the Clippers 
Thursday.  Although he did not score in the game his defense against 
Vancouver's Michael Dickerson might have solidified him at the two-spot.  The 
switch has worked lately as the Clippers have won two games in a row.  Keep 
an eye on Nesby, if he starts scoring some points he will be a solid Fantasy 
pickup.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/17/00 
 McDyess appears to have overcome the back injury that stunted his production 
last week.  He scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Bulls 
Thursday.  McDyess is averaging 22 points and 10.6 boards in his last three 
games.  It is now safe to start McDyess again if you benched him last week.   
 

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Suffering from the flu, Patterson is questionable for Friday's game against 
the Mavericks.  Patterson recently rejoined the Sonics' starting lineup at 
shooting guard.  If he is unable to play Brent Barry will probably start.    

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Dallas Morning News reports that Smith has agreed to re-sign with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves for the NBA veteran minimum of $611,000.  The deal, 
subject to league approval, could be formally announced later Friday or 
Saturday.  Smith's return to Minnesota will land him in his familiar role as 
a backup at the power forward and center positions.  His situation has 
created a lot of buzz but the truth is he is not much of a Fantasy player 
anyway.  If you already have a solid frontcourt don't try to pursue him.  If 
your Fantasy frontcourt is lacking then try to get him.  He will be a good 
addition to a Fantasy team but won't be a star.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Once one of the Spurs best outside shooters, Jackson has played in only one 
game this season, due in part to a lingering ankle injury.  At this point it 
would be wise to get rid of Jackson if you have him on your team and add 
another guard/forward.    

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/17/00 
 Webber sat out Thursday's game against the Lakers due to a sprained ankle.  
Scott Pollard started at power forward in Webber's place.  Webber is listed 
as day-to-day and is expected to return for the Kings' next game on 
Wednesday.    

 Terrell Brandon , G MIN - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Brandon will miss his third straight game Friday when he sits out the 
T'Wolves home game against the Spurs.  Chauncey Billups will continue to 
start in his absence.  It may not be a bad idea to bench Brandon and add 
Billups to your team until he is back to full strength.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Williams missed Thursday's game against the Hornets due to a left groin and 
hip strain.  He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  Shandon Anderson 
moved over to small forward in his absence and Cuttino Mobley moved into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard.  Williams remains one of the premier 
three-point shooters in the NBA connecting on 50 percent of his attempts this 
season.       

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Mills has missed Golden State's last two games because of a sore back.  He 
is questionable for Friday's game at Indiana.  When he does return he may be 
inserted into the starting lineup at small forward. Starting power forward 
Danny Fortson will be sidelined for the next few weeks due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Vinny Del Negro , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 Del Negro missed Wednesday's game due to an ankle injury and is doubtful for 
Friday's contest at Indiana.  Newly-acquired Randy Livingston will be the 
backup point guard in his absence.

this is pretty funny.  when you want to try sushi, give me a call.  i'll tell
you all the good stuff to get and we'll try some soy beans.  they are so good
for you and taste good too!  they're a great snack -- tons of protein, very
little fat and carbs.  you spelled it "discusting."

Jill,

I was wondering if I could get some information on the Costilla deal, 
specifically the repurchase option.  I need to know the term, locations, 
volume and strike price of the call.  


Thanks,

Little Nancy was in the garden filling in a hole when her
neighbor peered over the fence. Interested in what the
youngster was up to, he asked in his friendliest way,
"What are you up to, Nancy?"

"My goldfish died," replied Nancy tearfully, without looking
up, "and I've just buried him."

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the 
per month volume?

Thanks,
Joe

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/11/00 
 The Raptors placed Bogues on the injury list today, as he will be out four 
to six weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. To 
replace him on the roster, Toronto activated center Garth Joseph, who at 7-2 
is nearly two feet taller, from the injured list.  

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 The Rockets placed Cato on the injured list today, as he will be out for up 
to six weeks with a high left ankle sprain. Houston activated rookie forward 
Dan Langhi, who has been out all season with an upper leg injury, from the 
injury list to replace Cato on the roster.  

 Dirk Nowitzki , F DAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/10/00 
 Nowitzki sprained his left(non-shooting) shoulder Thursday after practice 
and is doubtful for Friday's game.  Look for Michael Finley or Christian 
Laettner to replace him in the starting frontcourt.    

 Lamond Murray , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Murray sat out practice Thursday with a sprained left knee but is expected 
to play against Toronto Friday.  Look for Matt Harpring to start at small 
forward if Murray is unable to play.    

 P.J. Brown , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brown sat out Thursday's game due to a strained left achilles.  He is 
expected to play in Saturday's road game against the Knicks.    

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 Mutombo scored 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his first game of the 
season Thursday.  He had missed the first five games and most of the 
preseason with a case of Malaria.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/10/00 
 Sprewell missed Wednesday's game against Cleveland and will sit out Friday's 
matchup against the Celtics.  Glen Rice will start at small forward for the 
Knicks in his absence.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  He is listed as day-to-day.  Erick Strickland will backup Charlie Ward 
at point guard if Childs is unable to play.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Majerle will try to run at practice today and is not sure whether he will be 
ready to return Saturday.  He has missed the first four games of the season 
with a hamstring injury.          

 Eric Williams , F BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Head coach Rick Pitino has moved Paul Pierce to small forward so Williams 
will now come off the bench for the Celtics.  He is averaging 4.0 points and 
2.3 rebounds per game.    

 Paul Pierce , F BOS - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 In a move to prevent Pierce and Antoine Walker from being double-teamed, 
head coach Rick Pitino has inserted Bryant Stith and Rick Brunson into the 
starting lineup.  Stith will play shooting guard and Pierce will move to 
small forward.  This move shouldn't affect Pierce when playing against teams 
in the Eastern Conference but could influence his numbers when he plays 
against the taller small forwards in the West.     

 Bryant Stith , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Stith will make his debut as the Celtics' starting shooting guard Friday 
against the Knicks.  Paul Pierce will move to small forward.  Stith is a good 
shooter and a dependable scorer but has been injury prone in his NBA 
career.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brunson will start at point guard for the Celtics Friday.  But he may give 
way to Chris Herren on Saturday when he is activated from the injury list.  
Keep an eye on Brunson.  Although he is not a prolific scorer he is a good 
passer and a solid defender.  He may be a solid Fantasy pickup within the 
next few weeks.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Williams was back in action Thursday against the Grizzlies.  He sat out 
Tuesday's game against the Lakers due to a mild knee sprain.  Williams showed 
no effects from the injury Thursday hitting 4-of-5 three-point attempts and 
scoring 13 points.    

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Harris played in his first game of the season Thursday against the Pistons.  
He had been sidelined since the beginning of training camp with a hernia.  
Harris scored five points in 12 minutes against Detroit.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Gill sat out Thursday's game against the Pistons because of a sore knee.  
Stephen Jackson moved from small forward to shooting guard and Aaron Williams 
moved into the starting lineup at forward in his absence.  Gill is expected 
to return to action in time for Saturday's home game against Seattle.    

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Wallace played against the Nets Thursday despite suffering from an injured 
left leg.  He scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 31 minutes of 
playing time.  

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Bogues will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Friday, which 
will sideline him for up to six weeks. He has been scratched from each of 
Toronto's last four games while the severity of the injury was determined.    
 

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 An arbitrator upheld commissioner David Stern's initial ruling on Thursday, 
stripping Smith of his Larry Bird rights.  Players with Bird rights can 
re-sign with their team even if the team is over the salary cap. Smith will 
have to play three more seasons to re-earn those rights.  Smith will probably 
sign with another team now.  The Timberwolves can offer Smith a one-year 
contract for no more than $611,000. Other teams, including the Miami Heat and 
Chicago Bulls, can offer Smith more than six times that amount.     

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  "Never 
Nervous" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped "The Man of Steel" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.

Some Road to the Presidency
Al Gore is contesting the Presidential election not from clawing ambition,
his spinners tell us, but because he has divined that he really won. Maybe
so. A mind that can count a dimpled chad as a vote is capable of believing
about anything.

Mr. Gore's professed high-mindedness would be easier to credit, though, if
it were not washed in the casual attitude toward the truth that we have come
to expect from the author of no controlling legal authority, the Buddhist
Temple fund-raiser and the iced tea defense.

The Vice President in his Monday speech to the nation repeated the
professions of supermouthpiece David Boies, for example, that there were
10,000 votes in Miami-Dade uncounted. These are in fact votes that were
machine-counted for other offices but did not register a vote for President.
The common-sense view of such a ballot is that the voter wanted to be heard
on other offices, but did not like either candidate for President. There
were 175,000 such ballots across the state of Florida, and 1.25 million
across the nation.

What Mr. Gore really wants is to pour over the 10,000 Miami-Dade ballots in
search of the mysterious "dimpled chad" votes for him. Bear in mind that the
county's board back on Nov. 14 shut down its first recount after a sampling
of three precincts turned up only six more votes for Mr. Gore. That seemed
in retrospect to be the sort of reasonable action so thought to be missing
from this endless exercise. The Democrat sued, forcing Miami-Dade to resume.

The Gore team currently argues that Miami-Dade is an undiscovered motherlode
of Gore votes because in the 135 of 614 precincts counted they produced a
Gore gain of 157 votes. But the recount went through the precincts
numerically, and the first tranche, heavily Democratic, are known to have
voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Gore. While those 135 initially counted
precincts gave Mr. Gore 73% of their vote, the Vice President's share of the
whole county was 53%. Those potent projections of Gore numbers from a full
recount that they're citing are undoubtedly an exaggeration.

The Gore lawsuit against Palm Beach is richer still. Here they are literally
arguing that poor Judge Burton and his colleagues didn't use sufficiently
low dimple standards, what the lawsuit calls "incorrect legal standards," to
accept Gore votes. Here as well we have a Democratic county and board, upon
whom the Gore folks were heaping praise less than two weeks ago, which
they're now suing.

In Seminole County, "independent" Democrats have sued to kill absentee
ballots certified for Governor Bush, who carried those votes by almost 2 to
1. Their case: The county's elections supervisor broke the law by letting
GOP office workers enter voter identification numbers left off of request
forms sent in by absentee voters, who had otherwise complied by signing the
form and listing the last four digits of their Social Security number. Want
more detail? Normally the ID numbers are preprinted on the forms before
they're sent out, which is what the Democrats did, but the GOP's software. .
. . Oh well, the Democrats are suing.

So let's review the story so far. We had a Florida count Nov. 7, then a
recount, and then we let Al Gore pick several famously Democratic counties
to hand-count; we've let various amounts of ambiguous chads be counted, let
his party officials eyeball the ballots, often going his way by a 2 to 1
vote, let a GOP counter in Broward resign, extended the pre-established
deadline and, let's see, what else? Oh yes, Mr. Gore still lost.

The Gore/Boies strategy now is essentially to sue everyone in sight, hoping
that some cache of votes reopens (Dade) or closes up (Seminole). His lawyers
argued yesterday that he'd already be ahead if so many military ballots
weren't counted. This is not "counting every vote"; it's asking lawyers to
overturn an election, not once but several times. And it's becoming
increasingly apparent to the American people; two national polls put support
for a Gore concession at 60%, a strikingly high number given the close
election result.

As to the Democrats, a few have wavered publicly on joining the Gore long
march, but mostly the party is circling the two exhausted candidates, on the
one hand standing behind Mr. Gore's attempt to reverse the election, while
simultaneously demanding to share power with the incoming Bush
Administration.

All this said, we have in fact found one Gore gambit to really admire:
Identifying that five-minute seam of network time for a speech at 8:55 p.m.,
five minutes before the start of Monday night football. Pretty clever. The
dimpled-ballot standard may not stand up, but opening up that 8:55
prime-time window for political speech may last forever.

I have not verified your math but "championships" prior to the associated 
press do not count b/c there was no governing authority that conferred 
national titles before the AP ( as you will notice the retroactive 
declaration of national champions prior to the early 1930's).

		 Subject: Re: FYI

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour" which 
will be paid for by Brian "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.

As you all are probably already aware, I am not the "math-genius" of the 
Texas Desk.  I meant to say that the combined total for both of the kids is 
$250, not $350.  The cost for each of us will, of course, stay the same.

Ooops.

I've adopted two children for the Enron Kids Program ..

Cortesia Taylor, Kindergarden
Jameka McCoy, PreK

The total cost for both children combined is guesstimated to be $350.  If all 
of us contribute, that will be only $15 per person.  I'll be taking 
collections this week and next if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Laura

I can do the tv but I am busy all weekend so, if I can do it next week let me 
know.  I might be able to squeeze it in on Saturday b/c I will be out that 
way.


On another note, do you know of any hotels in the cotton bowl area in Dallas?

DON'T WAIT FOR THE SCORES

If you're like a lot of us, you're tracking your fantasy
team via Live Scoring while watching the games on TV. Did
you know that Live Scoring can also track the real-time
scores of all the NFL games? Go to Live Scoring, NFL Games
and avoid waiting for the out-of-town scoring updates on TV.


THE TOP PERFORMERS

Want to see where your players rank among the top scorers
in your fantasy league? Go to Statistics, Player Scoring.
Initially, you'll see a list of your players, in point-
scoring order. Choose "All Teams" and "All Positions" from
the listboxes above the report to view every player in the
league, ranked by fantasy points, and see how your players
stack up. If your trading deadline still hasn't passed,
you can view the top scorers at a specific position, to
help you decide which player to target.


MILLER LITE

The tab for SportsLine's FREE Fantasy Football is being
picked up by Miller Lite, our favorite beer around here.
Check them out offline at your local bar or online with us.
Grab a Miller Lite. It's Miller Time!

GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you

MONITOR THE TRANSACTION WIRE

Go to Transactions, View to stay on top of every player
move in your league. The page will display all your
league's transactions, sorted by the date they were
entered. If your league charges transaction fees, they will
be displayed as well. You can sort the report by team, by
transaction type (only IR moves, only add/drops, etc.) and
by time period. Try to monitor the transaction wire as
often as possible, so you don't miss out if another owner
releases a potential sleeper.

Dear St. Arnold's Army:

Ho! Ho! Ho!

This Friday, November 10 will be our 6th annual Christmas Ale Pub Crawl!  And 
for the survivors, you will be mugged.  That is, you will receive a free St. 
Arnold mug.  To qualify, all you have to do is make it to four of the stops.  
This is always a fun event, but we also have a list of suggestions for all 
participants for maximum enjoyment.  But first, where will it be?  Well, it 
cannot be preannounced to specific bars, but here is the general info: 

We will be in the Greater Rice Village Area.

We will begin at 6:00 pm.  We will gather immediately before the crawl at the 
parking lot on the south side of Bissonnet just east of Kirby, next to the 
Chevron Station.  The parking lot has a sign that says Wayland Properties (or 
something very close to that).  We will look for a bar near there to start.  
Hopefully the Bentley will be parked obviously everywhere we go.  

At 7:00, we will proceed eastward on Bissonnet.
At 8:00, we will proceed south on Morningside, turning right on Quemby.
At 9:00, we will proceed south on Kirby a block or so.
At 10:00, we will proceed further south down Kirby, then left on Rice.
At 11:00, we will proceed east on University, then take a right on 
Morningside.  For this finale, we'll do a couple of bars at once on 
Morningside.  

The Hotline numbers to try to hook up with us during the crawl are: 
713-202-4557 and 281-686-5090.  Use this if hopelessly lost.

Now, for the tips for maximum enjoyment:

1. PRECOATING: Try to eat something before commencing the crawl. 
2. PACING: Too many Christmas Ales at the first stop is a critical strategic 
mistake.  This is known as "Sprinting Too Early" which is not advisable in 
this, a distance event.  Can have negative repercussions later.
3. MANNERS: Be patient with bar staff.  Remember, 100 or so people just 
descended upon some poor, unsuspecting crew.  They will be working as fast as 
they can, but they won't have 10 people serving us as there will probably not 
be another mass of jubilant humanity arriving upon our departure.  This is 
also sometimes referred to as the "Bum Rush", but in our case, it is the 
"Saintly Rush".
4. BUDDY SYSTEM: Make sure that you are always in contact with a couple of 
people you know.  One of you is bound to notice that the pack is starting to 
move on to the next stop.  This prevents the disoriented feeling of looking 
around an empty bar and realizing that the only three people still in there 
are guzzling some inferior malted beverage and may be related to the missing 
link.
5. MAKE NEW FRIENDS: As everyone on this crawl will be intelligent and good 
looking, this is an excellent place to meet new people.  Also, you will note 
that some people become better looking as the crawl wears on.  If this 
occurs, be sure to consult your Buddy System partner.
6. DESIGNATED DRIVER: Yes, we encourage this strongly.  You never know when 
you might decide to run for president.  And even the designated drivers on 
the crawl qualify for the mug.  While pregnant wives are perfect for this 
role, it is known to be poor judgment for a husband to claim that this is the 
best part of her being pregnant.  See "Mood Swings."
7. ENJOY ST. ARNOLD'S BEERS: It is in poor taste to be seen quaffing anything 
else.  Ever.  See "Curse of Saint Arnold."

We look forward to seeing y'all out there. Feel free to dress like Santa, St. 
Arnold or Rudolph.  Actually, not like Rudolph.  Deer season just opened.

Cheers,

Brock, David, Frank (both), James, Jamie, Jesse, Pete aka the Brew Crew!

PS:  Want to sell St. Arnold's or know someone that does?  Our distributor, 
Glazers, is hiring for a couple of positions in their beer department.  I'm 
not sure what they all are, but they are probably looking for a salesman, keg 
delivery driver and service tech/line cleaner.  Anyone who is interested 
should call Leroy Krischke at 713-578-1610 or Mike Allison at 713-795-4454.

Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

Jamie Hogan

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

READ THIS. LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU 
START YOUR DAY. 

Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is 
always in a good 
mood 
and  
always has something positive to say.? When someone 
would ask him  how 
he 
was 
doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would  
be twins!" 

He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having 
a bad day, 
Michael 
was there telling the employee how to look  on the 
positive side of the 
situation. 

Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I 
went up to 
Michael 
and asked him, "I  don't get it! You can't be a 
positive person all of 
the 
time.  
How do you do it?" 

Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say  to 
myself, you have 
two 
choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood 
or...you can choose? 
to 
be in a bad 
mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time 
something bad happens, 
I  
can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn 
from it. I choose  
to 
learn from it. 
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can  
choose to accept 
their 
complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of 
life. I choose 
the 
positive side of life. 

"Yeah,  right, it's not that easy," I protested. 

"Yes, it is," Michael said.  "Life is all about 
choices. When you cut 
away 
all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose 
how you react to 
situations. You  choose how people affect your mood. 
You choose to be in 
a 
good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your 
choice how you live 
your  
life." 

I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I 
left  the Tower 
Industry 
to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often  
thought about him 
when 
I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it. 

Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved  
in a serious 
accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications  
tower.? After 18 
hours 
of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was 
released from the 
hospital with rods placed in his back.  

I saw Michael about six months after the accident. 
When I asked him  how 
he 
was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. 
Wanna  see my 
scars?" 

I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what  
had gone through 
his 
mind as the accident took place. "The first  thing that 
went through my 
mind 
was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, " 
Michael replied. 
"Then, 
as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two 
choices: I could 
choose 
to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live." 

"Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?" I 
asked. Michael 
continued, "...the paramedics were  great. They kept 
telling me I was 
going 
to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I 
saw the 
expressions 
on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.? In their 
eyes, 
I read  "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take 
action." 

"What did you  do?" I asked. 

"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions  
at me," said 
Michael. 
"She asked if I was allergic to anything.  "Yes, I 
replied." The doctors 
and 
nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I 
took a deep 
breath 
and 
yelled, "Gravity."  

Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to 
live. Operate on  me 
as 
if I am alive, not dead." 

Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but 
also because of 
his 
amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we 
have the choice 
to 
live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything. 
"Therefore do not worry 
about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 

After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about 
yesterday. 

You have two choices now:  
1. Delete this. 
2. Forward it to the people you care about. 

You  know the choice I made.

A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes 
a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. 
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference 
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much 
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Thanks

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Subject: Re: Friday State of the Union  

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it "landry loaded"?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union

Warm fuzzies from Andy Rooney

I've learned....
    that the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.
'   that when you're in love, it shows.
    that just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!" makes my day.
    that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful
feelings in     the world.

I've learned....
    that being kind is more important than being right.
    that you should never say no to a gift from a child.
    that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help
him in  some other way.

I've learned....
    that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a
friend  to act goofy with.
    that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to
understand.
    that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I
was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....
    that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end,
the faster it   goes.
    that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.
    that money doesn't buy class.
    that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.

I've learned....
    that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated
and     loved.
    that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?
    that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.
    that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that
person  continue to hurt you.

I've learned....
    that love, not time, heals all wounds.
    that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself
with    people smarter than I am.
    that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.
    that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling
their   breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....
    that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.
    that life is tough, but I'm tougher.
    that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.
    that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

I've learned....
    that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he
may     have to eat them.
    that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.
    that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.

I've learned....
    that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his
little fist, that   you're hooked for life.
    that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness
and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.
    that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is
requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.
    that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

Dear Friend,

Thousands more Americans have signed their Petition to
Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.electionIntegrity2000.com . We=01,re building a tidal
wave of public support for fairness and integrity in the
aftermath of this presidential election.

Make no mistake, Al Gore=01,s team of lawyers and activists are
fighting to the finish in a desperate attempt to overturn the
results in Florida.  Here=01,s the latest:

After hand picking Florida counties to conduct recount after
recount and using the Florida Supreme Court to help them
rewrite the election rules, it still didn=01,t look like Al Gore
was going to be able to manufacture enough votes to win.  But
they want this election and they=01,re not giving up without a
fight.

Statistically, early returns from the manual recounts (hand-
counts) did not show Al Gore overtaking George W. Bush=01,s lead
in Florida.  So the Democrats have simply changed the
"hand-counting" rules again.  The new rules say that ballots
with dimples, loose chad or any indentation in the area of
the box should be counted.

No punch hole in the ballot is necessary for Gore to gain
a vote!

This amounts to mind reading because the activists conducting
the recount are allowed to divine the intent of the voter.

Gore=01,s team argues that "every vote should be counted" hoping
to gain votes in their favor, but they use every technicality
to disqualify thousands of military ballots delivered without
a post mark.  Why?

Because these ballots likely favor Bush at a rate of 2 to 1!

And even though military servicemen abroad can=01,t control how
their mail is delivered, Gore=01,s allies are fighting to deny
their votes.

We the American people must fight this systematic and
calculated effort to overturn the election.  We must fight
in the media.  We must fight in the courts.  We must fight
in the Florida legislature.  We must fight for public
opinion.

One way you can help is by urging your friends and family to
join our online campaign to Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.algorelost.org or
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com right now.

Spread the word by forwarding this e-mail!

-

    1.Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.  Do not walk ahead of me,
for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me the hell
alone.

    2.The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a
leaky tire.

    3.It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal the
neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.

    4.Sex is like air; it's not important unless you aren't getting any.

    5.We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse.

    6.No one is listening until you make a mistake.

    7.Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.

    8.Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

    9.It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a
warning to others.

    10.It is far more impressive when others discover your good qualities
without your help.

    11.If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car
payments.

    12.If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything.

    13.If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again;it was
probably worth it.

    14.Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach him how to fish,
and he will sit in a  boat and drink beer all day.

    15.If you drink, don't park. Accidents cause people.

    16.Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.

    17.Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.

    18.If at first you don't succeed,  skydiving is not for you.

    19.Don't squat with your spurs on.

    20.Good judgment comes from bad experience and a lot of that comes from
bad judgment.

    21.The quickest way to double your money is to hold it in half and put it
back  in your pocket.

    22.Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome of a raindance.

    23.A closed mouth gathers no foot.

    24.Duct tape is like the force, it has a light side and a dark side and
it holds the universe together.

    25.Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.

    26.There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.

    27.Never miss a good chance to shut up.

    28.Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is moving.

    29.Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.
That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their
shoes.

    30.Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.

    31.Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced,  you can't be
promoted.

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.



IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Brian Skinner , C LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Skinner was activated from the injured list by the Clippers today. He missed 
five games dating back to November 18 with a sprained right ankle. Skinner 
will need to rebound from a slow start to this season, as he is averaging 5.8 
points and 4.7 rebounds in 10 games thus far.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Barros was activated from the injured list for tonight's game against New 
Jersey. Unfortunately, the 11-year veteran probably won't have much Fantasy 
value this season, as he'll have a harder time getting playing time in 
Detroit than he did in Boston.  

 Don MacLean , F MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The NBA suspended MacLean for five games without pay today for violating the 
steroid policy of the league and the NBA Players' Association. He has been 
limited to just three games this season and was scheduled to miss at least a 
month after undergoing surgery on his right foot November 15. It's unlikely 
MacLean will garner any further Fantasy value this season after this recent 
development, especially considering he is the first player in league history 
to be suspended for steroid use.  

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Dickerson is expected to come off the injured list for Friday's game against 
Indiana or Sunday's matchup with San Antonio.  He has been sidelined for over 
a week with a sprained ankle.  Dickerson will be a little out of synch at 
first but look for him to pick up where he left off after a few games.    

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Walker is suffering from a sprained left ankle and is not expected to play 
in Wednesday's game against the Kings.  He was on crutches Sunday and Monday, 
but rode a stationary bike during Tuesday's practice.  The ankle could affect 
Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.  Although he has 
been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is only valuable in 
deeper Fantasy leagues.      

 Tariq Abdul-Wahad , G DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Although Raef LaFrentz will return to the starting lineup, Wahad will 
continue to come off the bench.  Wahad was removed from the starting lineup 
along with LaFrentz two games ago.  As has been the case for most of his 
career Abdul-Wahad has struggled with his shooting this season and hasn't 
been a productive Fantasy player, averaging 5.5 ppg this season.  

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 LaFrentz will be back in the starting lineup after coming off the bench the 
last two games, his replacement Keon Clark will go back to the bench.  
Although LaFrentz hasn't played too well this season head coach Dan Issel has 
stated he made the original move to prevent singling out one player for the 
team's struggles.  Meaning he benched LaFrentz to appease Tariq Abdul-Wahad 
who was also removed as a starter.  LaFrentz may not play much better now 
that he is back in the starting team but he will still provide as much 
Fantasy production as most other centers.     

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Buckner has missed the team's last five games with a sprained right foot.  
He had an injection in his sprained right foot that will prevent him from 
participating in practices for at least 2-3 days.  This will keep him out of 
action for at least the next two games.  Hubert Davis will continue to start 
at shooting guard and Michael Finley will play small forward in his absence.  
When Buckner finally does return it will take awhile for him to get back into 
game form.     

 Etan Thomas , C DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Thomas has a cast on his right foot for a fractured bone under his right big 
toe.  He is expected to wear the cast for three weeks.  His condition will be 
re-evaluated at that time.  Monitor his situation for now.  He is a good 
rebounder and shot-blocker who may be able to help a Fantasy team in 
January.   

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Bryant signed with the Mavericks Tuesday for the pro-rated veteran minimum.  
He was released by Cleveland on November 15.  Forward Bill Curley was waived 
to make room for Bryant.  Bryant will get some playing time off the bench but 
won't be much help to a Fantasy team.    

 Keith Van Horn , F NJ - The Wave Updated 11/29/00 
 Van Horn has been cleared to do some "light running" by team doctors and 
expects to return to the Nets in about two weeks.  He broke his left leg 
during a preseason game against the Orlando Magic.  When Van Horn does 
return, Fantasy owners will certainly be scrambling to pick him up.  

 Jim McIlvaine , C NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 McIlvaine did not play in Tuesday's game against the Jazz due to an 
intestinal infection and won't accompany the team for Wednesday's game in 
Detroit.  His return is yet to be determined.  McIlvaine holds no Fantasy 
value.  

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Atkins is still suffering from a sprained ankle, which kept him out of 
practice on Tuesday.  Although he is listed as probable for Wednesday's game 
against the Nets, rookie Mateen Cleaves may start in Atkins' place.  Even if 
he doesn't play, Atkins isn't expected to miss any significant time due to 
the injury.    

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Person was activated from the injured list on Tuesday after missing 
Cleveland's last eight games with an elbow injury. Before the injury, Person 
was averaging 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. Person will likely split 
time with Trajan Langdon, which diminishes what little Fantasy value he may 
have had.     

 Cherokee Parks , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Parks has been traded once again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers. He 
was averaging 3.7 points and 3.1 rebounds as Jahidi White's backup in 
Washington.  Parks holds no Fantasy value.  

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Clippers waived Ekezie today, just one day after the team acquired him 
from the Washington Wizards. He likely won't have any Fantasy value anywhere 
he ends up this season, as he's averaging just 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in 
10 games thus far.  

 Jermaine O'Neal , F IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/29/00 
 O'Neal was held out of the starting lineup because he was late for a team 
plane Monday.  He had started his team's first 12 games.  He still managed to 
post another double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds.  
O'Neal should be back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden 
State.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Collier had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Tuesday and will be out 
4-to-6 weeks.  With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets 
will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 Sabonis re-injured his left knee when he stepped on teammate Scottie 
Pippen's foot in the first quarter against Seattle on Tuesday night.  The 
extent of his latest injury is not known yet and Sabonis is listed as 
day-to-day.  He missed the first eight games of the season after arthroscopic 
surgery on the knee revealed torn cartilage.   Dale Davis will replace 
Sabonis in the starting lineup if he is unable to play.     

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  "If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him," said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/13/00 
 While completing 20 of 25 passes, Garcia threw for 244 yards with no 
interceptions, and ran for a pair of short touchdowns. In a fine performance 
against a talented Chiefs defense, Garcia showed a new dimension as a 
scrambling threat near the goal line. If defenses try to pressure him into 
making mistakes, Garcia can burn them with his legs in the red zone.   

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Klap Updated 11/13/00 
 Reaching triple digits for the first time since the 1998 playoffs, Anderson 
ran for 119 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. Don't expect too many more 
outstanding performances from Anderson this year. He is still not running at 
full throttle and may not completely look like his old self until next 
season.  

 Robert Smith , RB MIN - Eric Bass Updated 11/13/00 
 In addition to running 20 times for 111 yards, Smith caught four passes for 
53 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown. The Minnesota RB seems to be hitting 
his stride just in time for the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup 
every week.  

 Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Baja Updated 11/13/00 
 On the heels of his big game against Minnesota, Freeman was held to 36 yards 
on four catches. Most secondaries will continue to frustrate Freeman, who 
simply lacks a solid No. 2 WR across from him. Defenses won't be surrendering 
the big play to Freeman in these final games, because he is the Packers' only 
legitimate deep threat.      

 Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an uninspiring performance, Batch completed just 12 of 27 passes for 128 
yards with no touchdowns and one interception. The Atlanta defense has been 
vulnerable all year long, and Batch's struggles against the Falcons prove he 
is not a reliable Fantasy QB for these final weeks, even as a backup.     

 Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 On four catches, Johnson gained just 18 yards. He was not an integral part 
of Philadelphia's 23-point day, a major outburst for such a sporadic and 
unproductive offense. Johnson shouldn't be in your starting lineup if you 
need key wins in these next few weeks.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In an unnaccountably poor performance, Smith ran for just 16 yards on 17 
carries while losing a fumble. Such awful numbers against the defenseless 
Bengals raise major warning signs. Opponents will make Dallas beat them with 
the pass, and will be dedicated to smothering the run.      

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie back ran three times for just four yards while losing a fumble, 
and caught two passes for 18 yards. Despite a coaching change, the Cards have 
still not figured out how to properly utilize Jones, who needs more of a 
lateral, wide-open offense to succeed.      

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Rallying Seattle from a 14-point deficit, Kitna completed 22 of 33 passes, 
throwing for 231 yards and three touchdowns without an interception. It was 
eaily one of his best outings in recent memory, but Kitna seems destined to 
return to the bench once Brock Huard is healthy again. Don't expect another 
fine outing from Kitna anytime soon, because Huard is on the verge of being 
able to return.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/12/00 
 In one of his better passing displays, McNair completed 21 of 34 passes for 
228 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran four times 
for 34 yards. If Eddie George continues to battle injuries, McNair may be 
asked to carry the Tennessee offense in the weeks ahead.   

 Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The rookie wideout caught just one pass for four yards. Burress has been 
extremely ineffective this year, and don't be surprised if his playing time 
is cut drastically very soon.   

 Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 Completing 24 of 33 passes, Brunell threw for 340 yards and one touchdown 
while running for a two-yard score himself. Good numbers against a bad 
Seattle pass defense. Brunell has looked better recently, but will still 
struggle against stronger opponents. Despite his good numbers, the Seahawks 
wer able to disrupt his timing on key downs.   

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The second-year passer completed just 10 of 25 passes for 63 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception. Those numbers look particularly awful when 
you consider Smith was facing the talent-starved Dallas defense.      

 Trent Dilfer , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Despite throwing a potentially crushing interception that was returned for a 
fourth-quarter touchdown, Dilfer led the Ravens to victory again by 
completing 23 of 36 passes for 281 yards with the one interception and two 
touchdowns. A solid performance against Tennessee is enough proof that Dilfer 
should be a servicable backup in these final weeks.      

 Leslie Shepherd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 The veteran wideout caught just two passes for 19 yards. Poor totals against 
a soft San Diego secondary is an obvious sign that Shepherd shouldn't be in 
any Fantasy lineup this late in the year.  

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/12/00 
 Running 13 times, Smith picked up just 29 yards. With the running game 
sputtering, Smith is getting another chance from the Bills' braintrust, but 
it doesn't appear weeks of inactivity have improved his outlook any.  

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/12/00 
 Toomer suffered a concussion in Sunday's loss to the Rams. He did not play 
in the second half.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Leaf left Sunday's game against Miami in the fourth quarter with an apparent 
ankle injury. He was replaced by Jim Harbaugh. Leaf had replaced an injured 
Moses Moreno earlier in the game.  

 Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Reserve RB Trung Canidate left Sunday's game against the Giants in the third 
quarter after injuring his left wrist.    

 Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Favre left Sunday's game at Tampa Bay in the third quarter with a sprained 
left ankle. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck and later taken to the locker 
room on a cart.  Some published reports say Favre will miss one game, and 
maybe two.   

 Dave Moore , TE TB - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moore left Sunday's game against Green Bay. He suffered a concussion and 
Mike Alstott lined up at TE in his place until he returned in the third 
quarter.     

 Reggie Jones , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Jones left Sunday's game against Miami with an apparent knee injury. His 
injury came shortly after QB Moses Moreno had left the game as well.   

 Moses Moreno , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Moreno left Sunday's game against Miami with a strained left knee. He was 
replaced by Ryan Leaf.   

 Jeff Wilkins , K STL - The Klap Updated 11/12/00 
 Wilkins left Sunday's game against the Giants after injuring his hamstring.  
Jeff Hall will handle the placekicking duties in his absence.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Owens is playing today against the Chiefs but did not   start. J.J. Stokes 
started in his place opposite Jerry Rice.   

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/12/00 
 Alexander left Sunday's game at san Francisco in the first half with a 
concusiion. He returned in the third quarter.   

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Ayanbadejo re-injured his toe in Sunday's game against the Titans.  Sam Gash 
replaced him at fullback.    

 Thurman Thomas , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/12/00 
 Thomas sprained his knee in the second quarter of Sunday's game against the 
Chargers.  He was carted to the locker room and will not return.  Autry 
Denson replaced Thomas as the third-down back.    

 Robert Holcombe , RB STL - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/12/00 
 Holcombe did not play in Sunday's game against the Giants.  RB James Hodgins 
started at fullback in his place.      

 Ricky Williams , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 11/12/00 
 After rushing for 93 yards, Williams left Sunday's game in the fourth 
quarter with a broken left ankle.  He will be sidelined for six to eight 
weeks.  There have also been reports of possible ligament damage. Chad Morton 
should be the featured back in his absence. New Orleans might also use Jerald 
Moore and there is speculation they might take a look at Ki-Jana Carter.

What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

Hi Folks,

This is getting murkier by the minute.  Coach Jim Haslett was pumping up the
team with the "it's just one player" talk following the loss of Ricky
Williams and indicated New Orleans would likely not go outside for RB help.
Former Ram Jerald Moore and rookie Chad Morton were slated to carry the
load.  But they did go out and sign Terry Allen Tuesday.  I'm not sure
whether this indicates a lack of confidence in Moore / Morton.  It could be
they thought Allen was a bargain and it certainly can't hurt to have him for
insurance.

As far as the RB distribution goes, I'm kind of leaning toward Moore seeing
a good bit of work with Morton seeing more 3rd down type duties.  Sort of
like the Patriots are doing with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk.  Honestly, it's
tough to call right now and the Saints understandably are being tight lipped
about their plans.

Here's the story from USA Today.  Thanks to our friend Leo Scanlon for
pointing me to it.

Joe


http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/news.htm#saints NEW ORLEANS - Saints
running back Ricky Williams will have surgery Wednesday on the broken left
ankle that ended his regular season. Williams, hurt Sunday against Carolina
on a run that gave him exactly 1,000 yards for the year, is expected to need
6-to-8 weeks of rehabilitation. New Orleans signed former Pro Bowl running
back Terry Allen for the rest of the season on Tuesday. The team waived wide
receiver Charlie Jones to make room on the active roster. Allen started for
New England last season, leading the team in rushing with 896 yards and
eight touchdowns, but wasn't re-signed by the Patriots. Allen was selected
for the 1996 Pro Bowl while with the Washington Redskins and ranks fifth
among active players with 7,777 yards rushing.

I didn't realize that there was a "tradition".  Remember- I wasn't in y'alls 
little picture around this time last year.  What does the tradition consist 
of?

Hi Folks,

A couple of quick notes before we get to  this week=01,s Upgrades and Downg=
rades.

?

Replacing Ricky  Williams:?? Contrary to published reports,  Ricky Williams=
=20
bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to  ESPN.? The wor=
d=20
is that Jim Haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.? Chad=
=20
Morton and Jerald Moore will likely  be the choices with Morton getting fir=
st=20
shot.? Morton=01,s a little undersized at 5=01, 8=018  and 186 but so is Sa=
n=20
Francisco's Charlie Garner and he manages pretty  well.??Morton came from a=
=20
big  time program at USC and averaged 20+ carries a game last year so it=01=
,s=20
not like  he isn=01,t used to carrying the load.?  We=01,ll see.

Don=01,t Count Out Brett  Favre:? According to ESPN, Brett Favre=01,s foot =
is  much=20
better and he may practice this week.?  Even if he doesn't practice, he=20
thinks he may be able to play and keep his  record streak of consecutive=20
starts intact.

Akili Smith Benched.? Not  just benched.? Benched for Scott  Mitchell.? Tha=
t=01,
s gotta  hurt.

Marshall Faulk Raring to  Go?? With Trung Canidate out for the  year with a=
=20
broken wrist, Marshall Faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl=
e=20
to play this week.? Most  think that=01,s too optimistic but it=01,s nice t=
o see=20
the desire there.?=20



Jeff George to  Start??According to the Redskins, Jeff George will start =
=20
again this week at QB.? Coach Norv Turner has stated the starting QB job is=
 =20
Brad?Johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?

?

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=
n=20
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the=
=20
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.?  A=
s=20
we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it=01,s  inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.? Make sure=
=20
you understand,  what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? I=
n=20
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=
=20
Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=
y far=20
down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Mark  Brunell (Jac)?? I=01,m one of those guys who quickly  points out=
=20
Brunell has never put together fantasy numbers to warrant the hype he =20
receives but you can=01,t deny what Brunell has done lately.? Behind a beat=
 up=20
line, he=01,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th=
e=20
ball.? Jimmy Smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with Keenan McCardel=
l,=20
they=01,re one of the better WR tandems in the  league.? =20

QB Kerry  Collins (NYG)? A few weeks ago, I took some (deserved)  lumps for=
=20
my early praise of Collins but he=01,s kicking his game up a notch of  late=
.? He=20
looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=
=20
backs.? Watch to see how Amani Toomer is doing  but when he=01,s healthy, T=
oomer=20
and Ike Hilliard make a great WR corps.? A?solid ground game in Ron Dayne a=
nd=20
Tiki  Barber continue to help the passing game.

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? With  Deuce Staley gone, McNabb=01,s had to shoul=
der=20
the offense and this week he came  through with flying colors.? The bad  ne=
ws=20
is he only completed 47% of his passes Sunday.? The good news is he threw t=
he=20
ball 55  times.? When a QB airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn=01,t=
=20
usually bode well for the team=01,s chances of  winning but it=01,s certain=
ly a=20
plus for your FF team to see that many  attempts.? With that many chances, =
=20
it=01,s like allowing yourself to double the stats a Jeff Blake (23 attempt=
s=20
this  week) or Jeff Garcia (25 attempts) puts up.? Unless you have a really=
=20
good feeling  about Stanley Pritchett or Darnell Autry, I=01,d think you=01=
,ll see=20
him continue to  throw often.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)?? Remember, this list is  relative.? While he may no=
t=20
be a  starter, Dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that=01,s what=
 this=20
list is  all about.? He actually looked very  good at times in the huge=20
victory over Tennessee Sunday.? He showed nice poise coming back after =20
basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier.? Brian Billick did=20
wonders with a  marginally talented Tony Banks in 1999 and it=01,s conceiva=
ble=20
he might do it here  again with Dilfer.? They play Dallas  and Cleveland ne=
xt=20
but keep in mind Baltimore has a bye on December  3.

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? When I=01,m bashing Mark Brunell as a  Fantasy QB, I=
=20
usually compare him to Troy Aikman =01) Great real NFL QB but not a  much f=
or=20
Fantasy GMs.? Notice a  pattern here?? After being named the  starter Sunda=
y,=20
Aikman went out and lit up the Bengal Defense which was ranked #  20 over t=
he=20
last 4 weeks.? It=01,s hard  to put too much faith in him but if you=01,re=
=20
desperate for a QB, he could be worth  a gamble.? Tough matchup this week  =
vs=20
Baltimore but he gets the Vikings in week 13.

QB Jeff  Blake? (NO)? You of course know by now that RB Ricky Williams is =
=20
gone for 6-8 weeks.? I hate it for  Williams owners (I=01,m one) but what=
=01,s done=20
is done.? All we can do now is look forward.? And looking forward, I see=20
Blake being  forced to carry an increased load.?  QB Donovan McNabb threw t=
he=20
ball 55 times Sunday in the wake of losing RB  Deuce Staley and I could=20
easily see a similar type situation in New Orleans with  Blake throwing a l=
ot=20
more passes.

QB Rob  Johnson (Buf)? I make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching=20
issues but I=01,ve gotta say I think Mr. Charisma with the Spiffy  Sweaters=
,=20
Wade Phillips, is 100% wrong in going to Johnson.? In terms of roster=20
management, he=01,s  hands down the worst in the NFL in my opinion.? But no=
ne of=20
that really matters as Rob  Johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=
=01,s=20
been named the starter for this  week.? Don=01,t get too excited,  though.?=
=20
Johnson finishes roughly  half the games he starts and the next three weeks=
=20
vs Kansas City, Tampa Bay and  Miami could be brutal.? =20

QB Matt  Hasselbeck (GB)? Hasselbeck played nicely replacing Favre  this=20
week.? Remember there was even  some talk about trading Favre and starting=
=20
Hasselbeck this summer when Favre=01,s  elbow was a big concern.? Before yo=
u =20
give up the farm to snare Hasselbeck, you should know Brett Favre is=20
reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.? We=01,ll keep you=
 =20
posted.

QB Shane  Matthews / Cade McNown (Chi)? Again, I=01,m highlighting guys mov=
ing =20
up.? With the injury to Jim Miller,  Shane Matthews will be thrust into the=
=20
starting role.? The injury will also likely add a little  fire under Cade=
=20
McNown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=
=20
Miller was performing well.?  Matthews looked very rusty but it=01,s tough =
to=20
judge a QB when he=01,s thrust  into the game like that.? I=01,d look  for =
Matthews=20
at least for this week against a tough Tampa Bay defense and then  we=01,ll=
=20
see.? =20

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? You have to keep giving this guy his  props after=20
another great game.?  Although, if you=01,ve got an owner salivating over S=
mith=20
and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.? I=
=20
can=01,t imagine his value being any  higher.? His yard per carry number  d=
ipped=20
to 2.6 in Sunday=01,s game and he faces the Jets this week plus a brutal =
=20
matchup against Tampa Bay in week 15.? =20



RB Edgerrin  James (Ind)? It=01,s tough to upgrade a guy already near  the =
top=20
but he put in another great game Sunday with 155 total yards and shows =20
little sign of slowing down.? He  averaged 4.2? yards per carry Sunday  and=
=20
the Colts are leaning heavily on him.?  Watch out for a tough November 26=
=20
matchup vs Miami  though.

RB Robert  Smith (Min)? Smith quietly is having an incredible  year.? He=01=
,s=20
put those hang nail  injury jokes way behind him as he=01,s become one of t=
he=20
best RBs in the  league.? He=01,s running between the  tackles for the toug=
h=20
yards and catching the ball exceptionally well.? Keep an eye on that tasty=
=20
week 13  matchup against the Cowboys.? =20

RB Fred  Taylor (Jac)? Jaguar Fans may be distraught, but Fred  Taylor owne=
rs=20
have to be happy, at least lately.? Taylor=01,s running as well as he has i=
n =20
his career, even if his team is struggling.? One can only wonder what he=01=
,d be=20
doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?  He=01,s got two tough weeks coming=
=20
against Pittsburgh and Tennessee.? But as everyone knows, Taylor has a  gre=
at=20
stretch run of opponents in weeks 14-16 when he faces Cleveland, Arizona  a=
nd=20
Cincinnati.? =20

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? If you didn=01,t know better, you might  have tho=
ught=20
you were watching tape from 1998 if you saw Anderson Sunday.? He ran hard a=
nd=20
with the power and  quickness that pushed him to stardom.?? Hopefully, he=
=01,ll=20
be able to  maintain that form.

RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman=01,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke=
ep an=20
eye on that but assuming he=01,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.? He=
=20
scored a TD Sunday and  averaged 4.2 yards per carry on 12 carries.? He als=
o=20
added 8 receptions.? His main competition for carries, Thomas  Jones, had a=
=20
yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles Sunday:? 1.00???

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? Watson held his own Sunday as he rushed  for 62=20
yards on 17 carries.??  He likely won=01,t be a factor long as Marshall Fau=
lk is=20
already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=
=20
one more  week.?

RB Ahman  Green (GB)? With Dorsey Levens=01, troubles, Green  clearly shoot=
s up=20
the charts.? He=01,s  an enormously talented RB, but he=01,s got to learn h=
ow to=20
turn that talent into on  the field production.? After a tough  Tampa Bay=
=20
game last Sunday, he faces a soft schedule with the Colts, Panthers,  Bears=
,=20
Lions and Minnesota coming up.



RB Chad  Morton (NO)? With Ricky Williams out for the next 6-8  weeks, the=
=20
logical guy to attempt to fill his shoes is the rookie from USC,  Morton.?=
=20
He=01,s Detroit WR Johnnie  Morton=01,s little brother and was reportedly e=
xtremely=20
close to Ricky Williams and  shaken with his injury.? He=01,s small  but ve=
ry=20
quick.? He=01,s not as big as  you=01,d probably like but neither is Charli=
e=20
Garner.? Last year at USC, he carried a full load  as the featured rusher s=
o=20
he=01,s capable.?  The team hasn=01,t announced their plans yet and bringin=
g in a=20
free agent is  a possibility but I=01,d expect Morton to get a shot first.?=
 New=20
Orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with Oakland, Denver=
,=20
San Francisco and Atlanta all  ahead.=20

??

WRs Moving Up

WR James  McKnight (Dal)? Wow.? What else can you say but give the man =20
credit.? 8 catches for 164 yards  with a TD is a pretty good day.?  Whether=
=20
he and Troy Aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik=
e=20
what he=01,s done thus far.?  He=01,s got a brutal matchup next week in Bal=
timore=20
but he might be worth  grabbing to play against the Vikings in week 13.?

WR Sean  Dawkins? (Sea)? Excuse  us for not getting excited about a guy who=
=20
was buried on the Seahawks a few  weeks ago and had Jon Kitna throwing to=
=20
him.? But Kitna=01,s looking better and Dawkins  responded with a great gam=
e.?=20
Like  McKnight, the question is whether he can keep it up but he=01,s worth=
 a=20
roll of the  dice.?

WR Torry  Holt (StL)? I drew a few snickers a month ago when I  said I=20
thought Derrick Mason was the best WR on the Titans.? I=01,m just about rea=
dy to=20
call Torry Holt  the best WR in St. Louis.? And  that=01,s no knock on Isaa=
c=20
Bruce.?  Holt=01,s really coming into his own and to be honest, benefits gr=
eatly=20
from  the attention Isaac Bruce draws.? He  does face a couple of strong=20
defenses in Washington and New Orleans but I=01,m  betting he manages to pr=
oduce=20
against tough competition.?

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? Mason is clearly the best WR on the  team. Partly =
by=20
default as Kevin Dyson=01,s gone and Carl Pickens is injured.? But partly=
=20
because he=01,s just that  good.? The Titans had their running  game shut d=
own=20
by Baltimore Sunday and they were forced to the air.? And much to the=20
surprise of many, QB  Steve McNair fared pretty well and Mason was a big pa=
rt=20
of that  success.?

WR Ricky  Proehl (StL)? Great, just what Fantasy GMs need =01)  Another Ram=
 WR=20
to worry about.?  Proehl caught 6 passes for 53 yards and a TD Sunday.? In =
an=20
offense missing RB Marshall Faulk  as high powered as the Rams, there=01,s=
=20
probably room for another WR at the  trough.???

WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal)? Johnson replaced Travis Taylor in the  lineup an=
d=20
came up big with the game winning TD.? He only caught 3 passes but=20
understand  that he=01,s the 3rd receiver behind TE Shannon Sharpe and WR Q=
adry =20
Ismail.? Still though, it=01,s a Brian  Billick team and Trent Dilfer is pl=
aying=20
better with each series it  seems.?

WR Jimmy  Smith? (Jac)???  With 10 catches for 117 yards, I guess you can s=
ay=20
he=01,s back.? The Jags may be struggling but Smith and  QB Mark Brunell ar=
e=20
back in synch.?  Ride it while the combo is hot.?

WR Jerome  Pathon (Ind)? Terrence Wilkins had a firm grasp on the  #2 WR sp=
ot=20
early in the season but Pathon seems to be taking over there.? Pathon is=20
playing with more confidence  and more importantly, seems to have the=20
confidence of QB Peyton Manning.? He had 3 catches for 42 yards  Sunday.?

?

TEs Moving Up?

TE Bubba  Franks (GB)? For a long while Franks and TE Tyrone  Davis had=20
battled for time.? It=01,s  now looking like Franks has prevailed as Davis =
is=20
seeing very little time.? Franks made a great catch of the fake  kick TD an=
d=20
is showing some of the athleticism that caught the Packers=01, eye in  the =
draft.

TE Rod  Rutledge (NE)? So much for Eric Bjornson.? Rutledge seems to be the=
=20
new TE threat  for the Patriots and you know Drew Bledsoe likes to throw to=
=20
the TE.? If he can just get that thumb  healthy=01(?

TE Shannon  Sharpe (Bal)?? After some quiet weeks, Sharpe has  returned to=
=20
his place of one of the premier TEs in the game.? He=01,s clearly the best=
=20
receiver on the  team and has the confidence of QB Trent Dilfer.? Just as=
=20
importantly, he seems to have  confidence in Dilfer.

???

QBs Moving  Down?

QB Trent  Green (StL)? Mike Martz said a couple of weeks ago he  felt that=
=20
having Green behind center was =01&just like having Kurt in there=018.? We =
believe=20
him.? If you=01,re going to deal him, now=01,s the  time.? Even as well as =
he=01,s=20
been  playing, the league MVP Warner does not lose his job to a broken hand=
.?=20
The team is talking about December 3 as  a possible date he=01,ll be back b=
ut I=01,
ve heard even sooner.? Regardless, you have to figure his days  are=20
numbered.? Plus, upcoming games  against Washington and New Orleans in the=
=20
next two weeks could pose a  threat.?

QB Doug  Flutie? (Buf)? Right  or wrong, Flutie takes a seat as Rob Johnson=
=01,s=20
been named the starter this  week.? Hold onto him though as I=01,ve  got to=
=20
think the chances of Johnson staying healthy for long are  slim.



QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? So much for the Boston Globe=01,s Bill  Belichick=20
conspiracy that Bledsoe would miss several weeks.? Still though, you could=
=20
clearly see he  wasn=01,t 100% with the thumb.???

QB Brett  Favre (GB)? As you know, Favre suffered a sprained  foot against=
=20
Tampa.? While everyone  was shouting about how many weeks he=01,d miss, Fav=
re=20
told anyone who=01,d listen  today that he looked to be ready for this week=
=01,s=20
game against Indianapolis.? Players are notoriously optimistic so  keep an=
=20
eye on it.?

QB Elvis  Grbac (KC)? Don=01,t get me wrong, Grbac is still a top  QB.? He =
just=20
showed Sunday he=01,s  human.? He really should have done  more against San=
=20
Francisco though.?  On a side note, didn=01,t he say he=01,d shave that goo=
fy beard=20
when they  lost?=01(?

QB Brian  Griese (Den)? It=01,s the 3rd quarter of the  Monday Night game a=
s I=20

lot but it does seem to be affecting his  play.?

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)Another game, another  less than impressive=20

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Talk about blowing an opportunity.? Miller had been=

moving the Bears and  looked to be the spark Chicago was missing with Cade=

McNown.? And then Mr. Achilles decided he didn=01,t  want to participate.? =
Nasty=20
injury  and too bad as he was showing promise.???

RBs Moving Down? =20

RB Charlie  Garner (SF)? Garner=01,s been a regular on the upgrade  list an=
d he=20
had another huge game Sunday where he posted 141 total yards with a  TD=20
against the Chiefs.? Two big days  loom on the horizon though.? I  promise=

and New  Orleans in week 14 and 15.? He=01,s a  great player and one of the=
 best=20
RBs in the game but he=01,ll be facing some tough  matchups coming up.?

RB Ricky  Williams (NO)? As I reported yesterday to our email  subscribers,=
=20
Ricky Williams suffered a broken ankle and will miss 6-8  weeks.? I had to=
=20
chuckle watching  Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett talk about how Ricky doesn=

about how Ricky=01,s just  one guy and they=01,ll be fine.? Yada yada  yada=

sounds good Jim but you=01,re in for a rude awakening if  you really believ=
e=20
that (I don=01,t think he does)? Chad Morton will be the likely  replacemen=
t.?=20
Jerald Moore will get  a shot too.???

RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka (Car)? 1.7 yards per carry will not get it done f=
or=20
a  featured RB in this league and that=01,s exactly what Biakabutuka posted=
 =20
Sunday.? He=01,s got to get back on  track if the Panthers are to be effect=
ive=20
as a team.?

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? It seems as if Alstott is less of a factor every =20
game.? He only had 9 rushing  attempts Sunday for 38 yards.? If I  were him=
,=20
I=01,d pay Keyshawn to tell the coaches I needed some  carries=01(?

RB Emmitt  Smith (Dal)? What a disappointing game vs the Bengals Sunday.?=
=20
Smith fumbled early on what should have  been a sure TD and never seemed to=
=20
recover.? I thought he=01,d carry the load for a  struggling Aikman.? Turne=
d out=20
the  other way around.?

RB Shaun  Alexander (Sea)? So much for the idea of coach Mike  Holmgren=20
throwing in the towel for 2000 and starting the young players like =20
Alexander.? The rookie is a fine  player and will get his time but for now,=
=20
it doesn=01,t=01, seem to be happening  anytime soon.?

RB Trung  Canidate? (StL)?  Canidate broke his wrist Sunday and will miss t=
he=20
rest of the  season.? I have no idea how the Rams  will function without=20
him.?

?

WRs Moving Down?

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Is it just me or is Marvin Harrison  getting mor=
e=20
and more quiet with each game?? He only had 4 catches for 34 yards  Sunday=
=20
and didn=01,t seem to be a big factor.?  He=01,s still one of the best WRs =
out=20
there but I=01,m worried about his  production.?

WR Terry  Glenn (NE)? Glenn=01,s faded down the stretch and the  Bledsoe th=
umb=20
injury won=01,t help his play one bit.? Don=01,t be too down on him as he d=
oes=20
have  some favorable matchups on the horizon.?  But if Bledsoe can=01,t go,=
 it=01,s=20
trouble for Glenn.?

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? The loss of QB Jim Miller is huge.? The Bears ar=
e=20
now with their #3 QB and  you can only expect so much.?  Robinson will make=
=20
any QB better but there=01,s only so much he can  do.?

WR Antonio  Freeman (GB)? Freeman appears to be headed toward the  path he=
=20
was on a few weeks ago =01) mediocrity.? And that was with a healthy Favre.=
?=20
With a?less than  healthy?Favre, it could be worse.???

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Keyshawn Johnson=01,s gain is Green=01,s loss  as Q=
B Shaun=20
King seems locked in on Johnson.? Green will still catch the occasional  lo=
ng=20
ball but it appears for now, he=01,s the clear cut #2 WR.?

WR Terrence  Wilkins (Ind)? Suddenly, Terrence Wilkins is the  forgotten ma=
n=20
in the Colts passing game.?  For some reason, Peyton Manning just isn=01,t=
=20
giving him the looks.???

?

TEs Moving Down?

TE Kyle  Brady (Jac)? Brady=01,s still a solid TE but with the  return of J=

Smith, it=01,s clear that he won=01,t be the big target he had  been.???

TE Jay  Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma was a total non factor in  Sunday=01,s g=

catching only 1 pass for 7 yards.? One has to think the QB shuffle could =
=20
have an effect.?

TE Itula  Mili (Sea)? Mili=01,s yielded his starting TE job to  Christian F=

=09 ?? Margot Linney=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  According to the Texas sports information office, the Hex Rally=
 will=20
be held Monday, Nov. 20, at 9 p.m. on the university's main mall in front o=
f=20
the UT Tower. For years, the Texas-Texas A=02? game featured bonfires at bo=
th=20
schools. But the environmentalists won out in Austin, causing the end to th=
e=20
bonfire for UT students. In place of the traditional bonfire, Texas turned=
=20
instead to an old story to start a new tradition. In 1941, Texas had not=20
beaten Texas A=02?at Kyle Field since 1923. A group of students turned to a=
n=20
Austin fortune teller named Mrs. August Hipple, who gave them the=20
prescription for victory. "Burn red candles," she said. The burning of the=
=20
candles, she thought, would show the great support for the team. Texas won,=
=20
23-0, and the red candle legend was born. The candle burning lay dormant=20
until 1950, when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU=20
game, and the Longhorns upset No. 1 SMU, 23-20. It was back in the boxes fo=
r=20
the candles after that until 1953, when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was=
=20
unbeaten and seeking its first-ever SWC title. Texas blocked an extra point=
=20
after the first score and won, 21-20. "The red candles are the most potent=
=20
whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked," wrote Tim=
e=20
magazine after the upset. In 1963, Texas was driving for its first unbeaten=
=20
season in modern history, and the possibility of a national championship as=
=20
it hosted Baylor. For three of the previous four years, UT had been in the=
=20
same position - on the verge of a perfect year - only to be upset. Out came=
=20
the red candles one more time, and UT won, 7-0. Bonfires ended in Austin in=
=20
the late 1970s and seeking a new tradition, the "hex rallies" were started =

=09Chris Simms =20
=09
=09Q: So far this season, Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that we=
re=20
returned for touchdowns (if you count the return on the failed two-point=20
conversion attempt last week in Kansas). Can you help explain what Chris is=
=20
doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem? Also, has Chris set a=
=20
school record in this statistic? I enjoy the newsletter.=20
=09?? Jeff Cookston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking =
onto=20
his intended receiver too early in his drop back. He will look away from hi=
s=20
intended receiver
=09
=09but only for a split second. He needs to look off the defense better, an=
d he=20
also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage. He=
=20
suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre. He sees a receiver in=
=20
double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle=
.=20
Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and=
=20
returned for a TD against Kansas. He said he should have thrown it away. He=
=20
said he's learning. He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas =
is=20
at an all-time high. So that's good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up=
=20
getting the start against Texas A&M.=20
=09?

=09?? Steve Davis=20

=09
=09
=09 Q: Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle. To=
 his=20
credit, he maintained that two QBs were better than one. At this stage and=
=20
based on Chris Simms' recent games, it would seem to me that Brown was=20
correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five=
=20
games in a row. Also, Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simm=
s=20
motivated. What do you think?=20
=09?? Charley Davis, Southlake, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the rotation is now paying off. But I still stand by my=
=20
belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in t=
he=20
year. Mack Brown said the rotation didn't work as well as it could have=20
because this year's team lacked senior leadership. At North Carolina, Brown=
=20
said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older. Anyway, there's =
no=20
doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year. A=

Simms is definitely still happy at Texas. No chance of him transferring.=20

=09 Q: Which bowl do you see UT ending up in? I know that the second-place =

=09?? Mike Thakur=20
=09

s a=20
chance both teams will get into the BCS. Nebraska would then be the likely=
=20
choice for the Cotton Bowl, and the Texas-Texas A=02?winner would be the li=
kely=20
choice for the Holiday Bowl, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. But=20
there are rumblings that Nebraska isn't excited about the Cotton Bowl and=
=20
would rather go to the Holiday Bowl. That could send the UT-A=02?winner to =
the=20
Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insight.com Bowl =
in=20
Phoenix, Ariz. If Oklahoma beats Kansas State, the Wildcats would have thre=
e=20
losses, including one to Texas A&M. That means the Wildcats would probably=
=20
drop to the Insight.com Bowl. And the winner of the UT-A=02?game would go t=
o=20
either the Holiday or the Cotton, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. T=

for the following reasons: 1) UT's playing at home; 2) Jason Glenn, Robert=

out for the game; and 3) A&M's coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma i=
n=20
the biggest game of the year on a national stage. It will be hard to recove=

from that. It looks as if Texas has everything going for it. I believe if=

=09 ?? Justin S. Schwertner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I don't see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahom=
a=20
loss. They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence fro=
m=20
that game. The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss (or diminished=
=20
ability) of Glenn, Ferguson and Davis. Glenn, the team's sack leader and a=
=20
spirited leader at linebacker, is out for sure with a knee injury that will=
=20
require surgery. If Ferguson, one of the top receivers in the Big 12, and=
=20
Davis, a top cornerback for the Aggies, indeed cannot play, those are big=
=20
hurdles to overcome for A&M. Playing in Austin helps Texas. But this game=

will probably come down to who runs the ball best. Look for this to be a=20

Hole-punch all of your information for your trip (and make copies  of 
anything you'll need), organize it by what you'll need chronologically,  and 
place it in a slim, bright, lightweight soft-side plastic binder.  It's very 
easy to find in your carry bag, and you can easily flip  through to find your 
itinerary, the address of the hotel you're  going to, the phone number of the 
person you're supposed to hook  up with, etc. - Anita Brienza

Subject: Well Head Accrual Income Calculation

Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Subject: WH DATA

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

Dan,

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?


Thanks,

Eric

Hey Y'all,

Less then 2 weekes before I'm back in Paradise (Texas, not Hawaii),  lookin
forward to seein all ya that I can.  Here's a little note to spread the
holiday cheer.



Subject:  Johnny Christmas Letter

Dear Santa,
You must be surprised I am writing you today, the 26th of
December. Well I would very much like to clear up certain things that have
occurred since the beginning of the month! While filled with illusions, I
wrote you a letter.  I asked for a bicycle, an electric train set, a pair of
roller blades, and a football uniform.  I destroyed my brain studying the
whole year!  Not only was I
first in my class, but I had the best grades in the whole school. I'm not
going to lie to you Santa; there was no one in the entire neighborhood that
behaved better than me. With my parents, my brothers, friends and my
neighbors, I would go on errands and even help the elderly across the
street.  There was virtually nothing I wouldn't do for humanity! WHAT BALLS
YOU HAVE LEAVING ME A FUCKING YO-YO, A STUPID ASS WHISTLE,AND A PAIR OF
SOCKS!!!What the FUCK were you THINKING, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!?!?!That
you've taken me for a SUCKER THE WHOLE FUCKING YEAR, to come out with some
SHIT LIKE THIS under the damn tree.  AS IF YOU HADN'T FUCKED ME ENOUGH,YOU
GAVE THAT LITTLE SHITHEAD ACROSS THE STREET SO MANY FUCKING TOYS, HECAN'T
EVEN WALK INTO HIS DAMN HOUSE! Please don't let me see you trying to fit
your BIG ASS DOWN MY CHIMNEY NEXT YEAR! I'LL FUCK YOU UP! I'll throw rocks
at those STUPID ASS REINDEERS OF YOURS, AND SCARE THEM THE FUCK AWAY, SO
YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK YOUR BIG FAT ASS EVERYWHERE, JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO
SINCE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BIKE, YOU PUNK BITCH. You know what
Santa, FUCK YOU!!  Next year you'll find out HOW BAD I CAN REALLY FUCKING
BE...YOU'VE BEEN STEPPING ON THIS MOTHERFUCKER FAR TOO LONG!
SO WATCH YOUR BACK NEXT YEAR, YOU FAT BITCH!

Sincerely,
Johnny

Friday. Hotwire saved me over $800, compared to other online fares. 
What's more, when I missed my crucial connecting flight, the airline

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

yards  allowed over the last four weeks.? Plus they'll be getting CB Jason=

?=20
Isaac Bruce is the # 1 WR,?and he'll  bring Az-zahir Hakim and Torry Holt=

decent play but he's inconsistent.? Throw in the fact they'll  likely be=20
throwing a lot without Marshall Faulk and I think they'll do  well.

Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Packer Defense??  Green Bay may have salvaged the=

Jacquez Green is a solid WR and the  better deep threat.? TE Dave Moore has=
=20
been more active  catching a TD last week.
?
New York Jets Passing Game vs Colt  Defense??? Owners of Chicago's Jim Mill=
er=20
like to think  it was all Miller last week as he ripped through the Colt=20
secondary.?  Truthfully, the Colt's porous pass defense had plenty to do wi=
th=20
it.?  Vinny Testeverde should have similar success.? The Colts  rank # 18 i=

Detroit, New England and Seattle.? WRs Wayne Chrebet and  rookie sensation=

Laveranues Coles should do well.?  TE Anthony Becht is finally starting to=
=20
fulfill  expectations.? He's probable on the injury report with a knee inju=
ry=20
but  should be able to play.
?

Buffalo Passing Game vs Bear Defense??  The Bears have played decent pass=
=20
defense of late ranking # 17 in  passing yards allowed over the last four=
=20
weeks.? Peyton Manning rolled up  302 yards against them last week and ther=
e=20

prime threat at WR with  Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel rounding  out t=
he=20
WRs.? I'd think Reimersma and Moulds will get the bulk of the work  though.

?

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way

Chicago Passing Game vs Bills Defense?? If I'm  Cade McNown, I'm starting t=

 Kennison and Marty Booker catching plenty of  balls.? TE Kassem Sinceno=20
becomes a little more involved  each week.? I keep looking for him to make=

that big catch.

Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Defense?? The  Raider attack is firing on al=
l=20
cylinders here.? Denver ranks # 8 in passing  yards allowed over the last=
=20
four weeks.? They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points  allowed to opposing QBs for=

the year.? In their week 3 matchup, QB  Rich Gannon threw 2 TDs but had his=

lowest yardage total of the year  (159) and had 2 interceptions.? They've=
=20
improved since then.?  WR Tim Brown is the primary guy of course but both =

but we'll know more Friday and  Saturday.? Assuming he's ok, this is still =

tough matchup.? If  Bledsoe sits and John Friesz starts, this probably slid=

to a  "downside" matchup. The Browns rank? # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed to=

opposing QBs.? And they rank # 9 in passing yards allowed per game over the=

Minnesota Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Suddenly, the Vikings and=20

face an Arizona  defense that ranks # 13 in passing yards allowed per game=

with a reputation for  designing defenses to confuse young QBs. They rank #=

10 for the year in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing QBs.? Some of that i=

no doubt a reflection on  their weak rushing defense but the cause really=

where they  rank # 28 in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks.? I=

coach  Tom Coughlin to focus on what he loves best, the run.

Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs  Cowboy Defense?? The Baltimore game last week=

Even Matchups:? These games feature no real advantage  either way

the Colts can  contain him though.? They rank # 19 in rushing yards allowed=

it'll be a  matchup of two great RBs.

Buffalo's Sammy Morris and  Shawn Bryson vs Bear Defense?? Chicago ranks # =

San Diego's Jermaine Fazande vs Miami Defense??  Fazande seems to be the RB=

That's a lot for a Charger RB.? The  Dolphins are tough against the run=20

Denver's Terrell Davis vs Raider Defense??  Make sure to understand: Terrel=

last four weeks, Oakland ranks # 2 in  rushing yards allowed per game.? I=

expect Davis to do well, he's just got  his work cut out for him.

New York Giant's Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne vs Rams  Defense?? The Rams have=

been tougher against the run lately  where they rank # 6 in rushing yards=

allowed over the last four weeks.?  Their offense continues to force people=

 Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
 that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
 lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
 robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

 The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
 on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
 "Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
 escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
 by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889."

 After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
 consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
 picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
 image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

 The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
 Associated Press as follows:

 "Gunther Gore was a famous
 rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
 grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
 and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
 Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
 service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
 his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
 a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
 Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
 civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
 he was standing, collapsed."

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour" which 
will be paid for by Brian "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound

Hi Folks,

?

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.?=20

Passing Game  Matchups.?? Here's how I see the matchups this  week.? Please=
=20
note, see the  cheatsheet online?http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm=
? =20
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start.? Just becau=
se=20
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily=
=20
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup.? The matchup info  is mea=
nt=20
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between =20
players.??=20

Note:? I=01,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last f=
our=20
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mik=
e=20
Hall=01,s excellent FLM League Management Software.? http://www.fflm.com/fo=
r=20
more info.? =20

Here we go:

Locks:? These games heavily favor the Offense =20

Seattle Passing  Game vs Bronco Defense??  If we=01,ve seen one  trend rece=
ntly=20
in defenses it=01,s to start your QB / WR / TEs against the Broncos  and wo=
rry=20
about your RBs.? They=01,re  tough on the running game but easy against the=
=20
pass.? I won=01,t get into whether that=01,s a  =01&chicken or the egg=018 =
situation but=20
the bottom line is go with your passing guys  against Denver.? They rank # =
31=20
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.? QB Jon Kitna =
=20
gets another start  and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in=
=20
him, he=01,s been ok.? Derrick  Mayesand  Sean  Dawkinsshould see lots  of=
=20
action and rookie Darrell  Jacksonis working his  way back into the mix.? I=
f=20
you=01,ve  been sitting on RB Shaun  Alexander, coach Mike  Holmgren did sa=
y he=20
wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but I=01,m  still not too=
=20
excited about him yet.

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Bengal Defense?? Once again, keep an eye on  QB=
=20
Steve  McNair=01,shealth this  week.? It=01,s early, but he=01,s already  b=
eing called=20
a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle  injuries.?=
=20
Keep your fingers crossed  as it=01,s a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pa=
ss=20
defense.? They rank # 30 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last=
=20
month and are just playing out the season.? Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost=
=20
for the  year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier.?=
=20
Derrick  Masonis the clear cut  # 1 WR with Chris  Sanders# 2.? The best=20
receiver on the team (or at  least most utilized) is TE Frank  Wycheckwho=
=01,s=20
starting to  get back to his normal high level of  production.

Denver Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense??? By now you know the  drill:? Sta=
rt=20
any player vs  Seattle.? Just do it.? The Seahawks are anemic.? QB Brian=20
Griese did start to throw some  but he=01,s still at least a couple weeks a=
way,=20
maybe more.? Gus  Frerottegets another  start and if you=01,re looking for =
him=20
to regain that 400+ yard form he showed  early on, this is his best chance =
to=20
do it.? Rod Smithand  Ed  McCaffreyare the usual  must starts at WR.?  Dway=
ne=20
 Carswelland  Desmond  Clarkare excellent  plays at TE.? I=01,d start eithe=
r=20
one  and feel pretty good about it, especially  Carswell.

Baltimore Passing  Game vs Charger Defense?? San Diego made a run back at =
=20
respectability on defense but I=01,m thinking they=01,ve fallen back down t=
o well =20
below average.? Over the last four  weeks, they rank # 27 in passing yards=
=20
allowed per game.? For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed =
to=20
the opposing QB.?  The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be=
=20
ready to  roll.? QB Trent  Dilferis playing  exceptionally well and WRs=20
Qadry  Ismailand  Patrick  Johnsoncould do  well.? The most enticing matchu=
p=20
may  be Shannon  Sharpeas San Diego  ranks just 24th in Fantasy Points=20
allowed to the opposing TE for the  year.

St. Louis Passing  Game vs Viking Defense?? I don=01,t think you keep  QB K=
urt =20
Warnerdown for  long.? Sure, he had an awful game  last week but some of th=
at=20
can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you don=01,t see drop  half of what Warn=
er=20
throws this time.?  The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking=
 #=20
26 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last month.? For the year,=
=20
they rank # 24 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.?  Isaac Bruce=
=20
is the best WR  while Torry Holthas been  surprisingly disappointing lately=
.?=20
 He=01,s still worth a start though.?  Az-Zahir  Hakimalways has a  chance =
too.?=20
The Vikings just don=01,t  have the secondary to keep up with these  guys.

?

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Colt Defense?? I probably get more mail from my =
=20
ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player.? I make no apologies as=
 I=20
really just  don=01,t like the guy.? He simply has  major troubles finishin=
g a=20
game.?  Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy, one of th=
e =20
weaker defenses in the league.?  Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is=
=20
questionable so they might be  even less effective.? On the other  hand, th=
e=20
Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home.? As you can see from my=
=20
rankings, I=01,m not  thinking too much of Johnson again this week, but he =
does=20
have a good  matchup.? Eric Moulds is the  primary WR as always with Peerle=
ss=20
Price and Jeremy McDonald  picking up the scraps.? TE Jay  Reimersma is a=
=20
favorite target and gets plenty of looks.?

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Giants Defense?? The Kordell Stewart  Bandwagon=
=20
is getting awfully crowded lately, but for good reason.? He=01,s playing ve=
ry=20
solid football.? More importantly, he cleared a huge  hurdle Sunday showing=
=20
some leadership and toughness coming back in the game  after injuring his=
=20
leg.? The Giants  defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim=20
Fassell=01,s media games where  he says =01&ok=018 more than Joe Pesci in L=
ethal=20
Weapon are apparently working as his  playoff guarantee seems to have=20
inspired the team.?? The pass defense still ranks # 25  in passing yards=20
allowed  per game over the last month though.? For the year, they rank # 23=
 =20
in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing QB.? Hines Ward is the WR of=20
choice on  this team and I=01,d feel fine starting him. He=01,s not even th=
e true #=20
2 guy, but  you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw.? For some=
=20
reason, I like him over starter  Courtney Hawkins. Even TE Mark Bruener is =
a=20
solid choice as he=01,s  done more in the last two weeks than he=01,s done =
in two=20
years.???

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Panthers Defense? I=01,m  dreading the Gunther=
=20
Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like  Iron Mike.? A soli=
d=20
game here could  help him keep his job (which may have Chief fans pulling f=
or=20
Carolina=01()? From a FF perspective, I like Elvis  Grbac here.? He showed=
=20
Monday  night he was clearly back from the finger troubles.? As usual, the=
=20
running game is a mess but  that=01,s good news for Elvis owners as he=01,s=
 forced=20
to go with what=01,s been working  for them =01) throwing the ball.? TE  To=
ny=20
Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and  he=
=01,s=20
certainly the best receiver on the team.? Derrick Alexander is a sure =20
starter too.? Sylvester  Morris continues to regress which is troubling.?=
=20
Carolina ranks just # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last=
=20
four games although for the year, they=01,ve  fared better ranking # 9 in=
=20
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.? Part  of that is they seem to=
=20
give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be  leery in TD only=20
leagues.?

Carolina  Passing Game vs Chief Defense?? If you=01,ve been fence sitting w=
ith =20
Steve Beuerlein, this may be a week to take a close look at him.? The Chief=
s=20
rank # 21 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and=
=20
they may be missing CB James  Hasty who=01,s questionable with a knee.?  WR=
=20
Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and he=01,s  a sure=
=20
starter.? Donald Hayes  got through last week=01,s game without reinjuring =
his=20
groin and he=01,s a solid  option as well.? TE Kris  Mangum is no Wesley Wa=
lls=20
but he=01,s a pretty good player.? The Chiefs do get back home where  they=
=01,re=20
tougher but I like this matchup.?

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense??  The 49er pass defense is=
=20
better than people think and the Saints defense  is worse than many assume.=
?=20
Over the  last four games New Orleans ranks # 20 in passing yards allowed=
=20
per  game.? (the 49ers  rank # 16)? In reality, both  defenses are pretty=
=20
suspect.? And  both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball.? Jeff=
=20
Garcia picked up right where  he left off last week against a tough San Die=
go=20
defense.? It was great news for Terrell  Owens fans as he looks on his way=
=20
back.? In the meantime, Jerry Rice  showed he still has a few tricks in the=
=20
bag.? I wouldn=01,t be surprised to see Tai  Streets and J.J. Stokes see=20
increased time at Rice=01,s expense though  as many feel the Hall of Famer =
isn=01,t=20
in the 49er=01,s plans for 2001.? RB Charlie Garner is always a threat  cat=
ching=20
the ball.? TE Greg  Clark is suddenly a producer so he=01,s worth a shot to=
o.=20
This could be a  shootout.?

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense??  Two teams heading for the=
=20
couch in the post season but that=01,s about all  they have in common.?=20
Jacksonville  just ran out of time as they=01,re playing well now.? Arizona=
 is=20
heading downhill from an  already low position.? Arizona ranks  # 19 over t=
he=20
last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game.? QB Mark  Brunell had a=
n=20
injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be  fine.? He could be a=
=20
decent play  along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.? Arizona CB=
=20
Aneaes Williams is a player  but he can=01,t do it all.? The biggest  probl=
em=20
for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling =20
something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a 7 yard=20
gain  each time=01(?

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Ram Defense?? You don=01,t need any analysis fro=
m  me=20
to know you=01,d better start Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter and Randy  Moss=
.?=20
The Rams are much  improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks,=
=20
they rank # 17  in passing yards allowed  per game.? Still  though, the=20
Minnesota =01&Big 3=018 (=01&Big 4=018 counting RB Robert Smith) are no  br=
ainers.?? =20

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense?? QB Aaron Brooks  continues to b=
e=20
one of the better stories of this season.? He=01,s facing a 49er time that=
=01,ll be=20
chock  full of youngsters although they=01,re playing better of late rankin=
g #=20
16  in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.? But that=
=20
was before losing Safety Lance  Shulters to a torn ACL last week.?  Brooks=
=20
will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should  continue to shine.?=
=20
Willie  Jackson is a solid # 2 WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive =20
lately.? =20

??

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Detroit  Passing Game vs Packer Defense?? Of course, all this hinges on the=
 =20
ribs of one Charlie Batch.?  If he can=01,t go, all bets are off.?  In fact=
,=20
even if he can go, you should hedge your bets a bit as we=01,ve  already se=
en=20
one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch.? It=01,s not a=
 bad=20
matchup though against a  Green Bay defense that=01,s ranked # 22 in passin=
g=20
yards allowed per  game.? Johnnie  Morton is likely the top choice at WR wi=
th=20
Herman Moore in the mix  too.? Germane Crowell may be  able to make his=20
return this week as he=01,s been practicing this week.? I wouldn=01,t start=
 him yet=20
but keep an eye  out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him=
=20
up.? I can see plenty of James Stewart in  this one though as the weather=
=20
could be really nasty for this  one.?

Chicago  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense?? This one=01,s full of story line=
s as =20
a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane =20
Matthews.? The juicy rumor here  is that according to a story in the Sun=20
Times, McNown would receive a $8.25  million escalator clause if he plays i=
n=20
55% of the offensive snaps this year and  next.? He=01,s currently at 54%=
=01(?=20
Conspiracies aside, Matthews will be  without WR Marcus Robinson who=01,s o=
ut=20
for the year with a bulging disk in  his back.? New England ranks # 23  ove=
r=20
the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game but the turmoil coul=
d=20
take it=01,s toll on the Bears.? The Bears will also be without Offensive =
=20
Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job.? Some think that will be a=
=20
positive.?? I honestly have a hard time  getting too excited about Eddie=20
Kennison and Marty  Booker.?

Dallas  Passing Game vs Redskin Defense? I=01,m really interested to see ho=
w=20
the  team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie.?  I=01,ll be surprised if t=
hey=20
don=01,t kick things up several notches.? Although I do find it odd that th=
e=20
guy  in charge of the worst performing part of the team (passing game) is t=
he=20
guy  they decided to elevate to head coach.?  Who knows?? QB Troy  Aikman=
=20
will try to get through another game without being maimed.? He=01,ll have J=
ames=20
McKnight and  Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promisin=
g=20
against a  pretty tough defense.? Dallas showed  last week the complete lac=
k=20
of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding  Emmitt Smith the ball =
as=20
they trailed Tampa by a mile.? David LaFluer and Jackie  Harris both are=20
dropping along with Aikman.?

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Brown Defense?? Two teams used to bringing up=
=20
the  rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping.? QB Donovan=
=20
McNabb finds himself  in a strange spot here.? The Browns  are so pitiful=
=20
against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them  at the=20
expense of throwing it.? But  with McNabb the team=01,s best rusher, he=01,=
ll have=20
to decide which way he=01,s going to  beat the Browns.? Charles Johnson  an=
d=20
Torrance Small aren=01,t much.?  TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he =
could=20
make some  noise.? I'm interested to see how quickly they work in newly=20
signed  RB Chris Warren.

Miami  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense??  Another good case of=20
misconceptions.? Miami is better throwing the ball than  people give them=
=20
credit for and the Bucs aren=01,t as dominant stopping the pass  like many=
=20
think.? Over the last four  weeks, Tampa ranks # 14 in passing yards allowe=
d=20
per  game.? Very solid  for sure, but not dominating.?  Jay Fiedler continu=
es=20
to astound his critics as he threw for 3 TDs  Sunday.? I don=01,t think you=
=01,ll=20
see  the same production here but he=01,s still a decent play.? Leslie Shep=
herd=20
had been my  favorite WR here but with his surgery, it looks like Tony Mart=
in=20
will  finally get a start.? Oronde  Gadsden continues to make sick catches.=
?

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense ??This is where Doug Pederson=01,s=
 at:?=20
He gets the start this week because  rookie Spergon Wynn can=01,t go due to=
=20
injury=01(?? WR Kevin Johnson is running the  scout team in practice.? Agai=
nst=20
the  tough Eagles secondary, he likely will have trouble no matter where he=
=20
lines  up.? I don=01,t look for much here from  any of these guys.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Titan Defense?? The Bengals just won=01,t die =
=20
quietly.? Corey Dillon keeps running  the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott=
 =20
Mitchellseems intent on  proving to folks he really can play at this level.=
?=20
He may be able to but he draws a tough  matchup Sunday in a Titan team that=
=01,s=20
solid.? They rank # 11 over the last four week  in passing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game.?  Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad=
=20
wrist  and will likely have to play with a brace.?  WR  Peter Warrickwill=
=20
reportedly  have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a=20
difference.? He=01,s often worth a roll of the dice for  the start as he ha=
s the=20
big play  potential.

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Steeler Defense?? The Steelers seemed to=20
enjoy the  spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot=
=20
this week  against the Giants.? Pittsburgh=01,s  playing tough pass defense=
 now=20
as they rank # 10 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four=20

Oakland Passing  Game vs Jets Defense?? The Raiders look to bounce back  th=
is=20
week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and =20
distance.? The Jets are playing  tough defense of late ranking # 9 in passi=
ng=20
yards allowed per game over the  last four weeks.? Still though,  QB Rich =
=20
Gannonis a pretty much  sure starter unless you=01,re loaded at QB.?  Same =

with WR Tim  Brown.? You might roll the dice on  Andre  Risonor  James =20

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Tampa Bay Passing  Game vs Miami Defense??  Don=01,t start your  passing ga=

Dear Eric,

Keep up the good work!  Election Integrity 2000 is already
over 254,000 petitions to Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  We're going to see this thing through to the end
so please continue to spread the word.

Fortunately, there are many other groups out there fighting
to prevent Al Gore from stealing this election.  I'm
forwarding an e-mail I just received from the editor of
Newsmax.com describing their emergency campaign to get the
truth out.  Check it out!

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Dear Concerned American:

The major media are not telling the truth about this
election and the serious vote fraud that has taken place.

Al Gore is trying to steal this election and the liberal
media are helping them.

NewsMax.com has set up an Emergency Fund to take out ads
across America to directly inform the American people about
this election and Al Gore's attempt to overturn the election
results.

It's critically important we bypass the major liberal media.

Already NewsMax has taken ads out in major newspapers like
USA Today. We plan on more ads on the web, in major papers,
and even ads on TV and radio.

If you want to help or just want more information, please
read NewsMax.com's Urgent Letter.

Click here to read the urgent letter:
http://www.newsmax.com/election-generic1.shtml

This is important. Al Gore is planning to take this to the
Electoral College. We need to act now.

Thank you.

Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL 
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you 
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the 
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during 
lunch.   

Thank you for your cooperation.

Now I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through 
cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A 
designated IR player cannot play.  There are no IR moves during the week.  
That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each 
week.

Please remind your guys to report Gas Daily positions for Dec. and Jan 
between now and the end of the month.  In some cases January gas daily 
positions may not be coming in automatically and will have to be plugged.  
This a result of computer logic problem and not an ERMS/TAGG problem.  Also,  
there should no January basis positions starting tomorrow.

Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.  

http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html

By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their 
weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.  But 
hey, at least you're still ahead of Iona and Bradley.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
football,
                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
watch.

Enough said.

Major breakthrough, we have 16 tickets.  Now we need to win 'em.  After the 
f'''aggies near victory vs. ou, these tickets are now priceless.  Therefore, 
we must win at all cost THIS Saturday, the 18th.  

The team to date is as follows:

Stephen 
Eric
Luis
Paul
Sarah   
Myself
Christopher Chenoweth - new addition (recruited away from Webb Jennings' team 
at no small cost)

One other unnamed guy (Luis, I need this name).

===

To do:

1.   I need all of you to confirm (by voice or email) that you will be able 
to play on Saturday.  If I don't hear from you, I will have to replace you.  
If you think there is a chance that you won't make, please contact me ASAP.

2.   We need to deliver $2,000 in donations.  If you haven't started bringing 
in donations, please do so immediately.  I have the donation envelopes, 
contact me and I'll have one sent to you.

3.  We will have a scrimmage this Wed. or Thurs.  so mark your calender.  I 
encourage you all to take whatever steps necessary to see to your physical 
preparation for this game.  

My extension is 37842.   Home phone is 713-864-6229.

WE HAVE 16 TICKETS FOR THE WINNING TEAM!!!

Thanks to Brandon Houston and the Andersen Consulting team for finding the 
tickets!!!!!  Brandon will bring the tickets to the game on Saturday for 
distribution to the event winners.

The tickets will cost $560.  Enron will need to pay for half of the tickets.  
Ted, please coordinate with Karen Marshall in community relations to have a 
check for Brandon.

Thanks everyone!  We are now in excellent shape for the game on Saturday.  
Keep collecting those donations this week.  All Enron donation packets 
received by Brad Mauritzen by 5pm Friday night will be counted towards the

lNO MISTAKING WHO IS IN CHARGE OF  REDSKINS...
[IMAGE].Written By TFL Report Editor Bob  Harris| Posted Thursday December=

[IMAGE]


[IMAGE]According to the Associated Press, out  of sheer habit, Terry Robisk=
ie=20
almost forgot he was  in charge during his first practice as interim coach =
of=20
the  Washington Redskins.=20

In fact, the man really in charge wasn't  there at all.=20

Dan Snyder was  attending league meetings in New York and wasn't sitting in=
=20
his  usual white chair on the sideline Wednesday. If he had been there,  th=
e=20
owner would have seen Robiskie do a double-take to keep from  following the=
=20
same routine he had when he was in charge of receivers  under fired coach=
=20
Norv Turner.=20

"Today the whistle blew and I started  going out with my receivers," Robisk=
ie=20
said. "And I realized I  couldn't. I had to go out and stand in the middle =
of=20
the field and  do whatever it is Norv's been out there doing."=20

And what did Robiskie do in the middle of  the field?=20

"I did what I usually do," Robiskie said  with a shrug. "Talking."=20

Robiskie made some changes. He eliminated  the morning walk-through so=20
players can rest their legs. He  simplified the offensive scheme. He spent=
=20
more time on special  teams, in part because new special teams coach Pat =
=20
Flaherty is also trying to nail down a new routine.=20

Robiskie also said he'll have the last  word "once the whistle blows" and t=
he=20
game begins. Otherwise, he  made it clear that Snyder is the boss.=20

"A lot of people want to separate us from  Mr. Snyder," Robiskie said. "Mr.=
=20
Snyder owns the football team. I  know that. I promise you there's very few=
=20
things in the building I'm  going to say I want to change without calling h=
im=20
to say I want to  change it."=20

The subject arose when earlier in the day  when disgruntled quarterback Bra=
d=20
Johnson said  Snyder =01* not Robiskie =01* made the decision to start Jeff=
  George=20
the rest of the season.=20

"I think that decision's made from up  top. ... I think it's obvious,"=20
Johnson said. "I think Jeff's going  to be the starter the rest of the way=
=20
out. In case something happens  with him, then I'll be ready to go.=20
Otherwise, I'm just going to  finish strong up here and deal with my=20
situation in the offseason." =20

Robiskie said the decision to go with  George was a collective one made by=
=20
the coaches and Snyder. Turner  had planned to go with George for this week=
's=20
game against Dallas.  Turner was fired Monday, a day after a 9-7 loss to th=
e=20
New York  Giants.=20

"If I wanted to change my desk, I'm going  to call him and say I want to=20
change my desk," Robiskie said. "If I  want to change quarterbacks, I'm goi=
ng=20
to call him and say, `What do  you think of me changing quarterbacks?' It's=
=20
his football team. To  try to separate it, we're wasting our time."=20

Snyder was not available for comment. His  spokesman, Karl Swanson, said=20
Robiskie "makes all  football decisions, just as Norv did. He doesn't need =
to=20
ask  anybody's permission."=20

Still, Robiskie's remarks might make it  even harder for the Redskins to lu=
re=20
a high-profile coach for next  season. One thing is for sure: The quarterba=
ck=20
who led them to their  only playoff appearance since 1993 does not plan to=
=20
return.=20

Johnson's relationship with Snyder has  been frosty since the owner signed=
=20
George to a huge contract in the  spring and refused to negotiate a new one=
=20
for Johnson. While Turner  preferred Johnson, George was Snyder's chosen=20
catch.=20

Johnson's contract expires at the end of  the season, and he restated his=
=20
intention to become a free agent. =20

"I still stand by what I want to do,"  Johnson said. "We tried to work out=
=20
stuff a long time ago, and it  didn't work out on both sides. And you've go=
t=20
to move on."=20

The only way the Redskins can keep  Johnson from becoming a free agent woul=
d=20
be to designate him as a  franchise player, but that would require an upfro=
nt=20
commitment of  about $6.5 million from a team with almost no salary cap=20
room. =20

Johnson's career record as a starter is  31-18. George's is 46-74. Johnson=
=20
said he would not mind working  with Turner again.=20

"I wouldn't have a problem strapping it  up with him again at all under=20
different circumstances," Johnson  said. "Norv's a tremendous coach. He's=
=20
going to go one way, and I'm  going to go another way, and you never know=
=20
where that road leads in  the end."

lSAINTS PK BRIEN ON THIN  ICE...

[IMAGE]According to Ted Lewis of the  New Orleans Times-Picayune, "this=20
should be a  happy time for Saints kicker Doug Brien. =20

"For the first time since he was a  rookie with the eventual Super Bowl=20
champion 49ers in 1994,  he's on a team that is zeroing in on a playoff=20
berth.=20

"But as so often happens to those  playing the most precarious position on=
=20
the team -- there's a  little dark cloud on the horizon.=20

"Unhappy with Brien's misses of  field-goal attempts in three of his last=
=20
four games, the  Saints brought in free-agent kickers Michael  Husted and=
=20
Doug Pelfrey for workouts  Tuesday, although neither was signed.=20

"'First of all, we wanted to see  who's out there,' special teams coach Al =
=20
Everest said. 'And I would hope it makes Doug aware  that he has a=20
responsibility to the team and to himself, and  that security in this=20
business is success.'=20

"It's the first time in Brien's six  seasons with the Saints that his job=
=20
appeared anything less  than secure. But the working out of Husted and=20
Pelfrey doesn't  have him looking over his shoulder any more than he has in=
=20
the  past.=20

"'I was plenty motivated before,'  said Brien, who was told about the=20
workouts by Everest on  Monday. 'So it doesn't increase my motivation.=20

"'And it doesn't affect my  concentration, either. There's always a long li=
ne=20
of guys out  there, whether they're here working out or in camp. If you =20
don't perform to a certain standard, that's what happens.' =20

"By Brien standards, he is not  having a good year. The fifth most-accurate=
=20
kicker in league  history coming into the season (80.3 percent) is 17-of-23=
, =20
.739. The six misses are Brien's most since 1995 when he was  7-of-12 in si=
x=20
games with the 49ers and 12-of-17 in eight  games with the Saints. Since th=
en=20
the most he has missed has  been five.=20

"Brien, the number-two kicker from  beyond 50 yards in league history befor=
e=20
this season (.700),  has been allowed to try only two from that distance, a=
nd=20
both  were blocked.=20

"'I've been struggling a little  bit,' said Brien, who took extra kicks in=
=20
practice Wednesday.  'I haven't been hitting the ball as well as I normally=
=20
do. =20

"'It's very frustrating, but at the  same time, the law of averages plays i=
n.=20
I've been pretty  consistent over the last five years here, and I wouldn't=
=20
say  I'm doing horribly. I just expect to do better, and the Saints  expect=
=20
me to be better.'=20

"It's not so much how many kicks  Brien has missed but when he has missed=
=20
them.=20

"At St. Louis, he was wide right on  a 44-yarder with 2:21 left that would=
=20
have given the Saints a  10-point lead. Instead, they had to sweat out two=
=20
more  possessions by the Rams that could have tied the score. =20

"And last week against Denver, he  was wide left on a 43-yarder in the firs=
t=20
quarter that would  have given the Saints the early lead. Never mind that h=
e=20
made  three more after that.=20

"That miss had Saints coach  Jim Haslett visibly unhappy on the sideline =
=20
last Sunday and again on Monday=20

"'It wasn't the hold,' Haslett said  then. 'It wasn't the snap. It wasn't=
=20
protection.=20

"'He just missed it, and it would  have been nice to have had those three=
=20
points.'=20

"But Wednesday, Haslett took the  unusual step of sitting with Brien at his=
=20
locker for several  minutes after practice, engaging in what appeared to be=
 =20
lighthearted encouragement.=20

"'I have confidence in Doug,'  Haslett said. 'I can't get inside kickers'=
=20
heads, but Doug  will fight through this, and everything will be fine.=20

"'Everybody goes through this in a  point in their career.'=20

"Maybe so, but kickers and punters  are the only front-line players who can=
=20
be replaced on a  moment's notice, even this late in the season.=20

"'Right now, kicking field goals  and extra points is all Doug does since o=
ur=20
kickoff guy is  Toby (Gowin),' Everest said. 'But we haven't seen anybody=
=20
yet  we think is better than Doug.'=20

"To be sure, the Saints will bring  in two more kickers next Tuesday, Jeff=
=20
Hall  and Scott Blanton.=20

"And to Brien, who likes to think  of each kick being of equal value, no=20
matter the distance or  the situation, it is a time to strive to do better.=
=20

"'I've been pressing a little too  much and trying to make things happen,' =
he=20
said. 'I'm not way  far off, but it doesn't take too much.=20

"'I don't think I've ever missed a  kick at the end of a game that's cost t=
he=20
team a game, and I  don't intend to start now. I'm doing what I can to get=
=20
this  fixed and just keep plugging along.'"=20

Also of interest...=20

ESPN's John  Clayton reported that Terry Allen  will probably get the start=
=20
at halfback for the Saints because  of the neck injury to Jerald Moore and=
=20
the  sore shoulder of Chad Morton. Morton may play  on his shoulder, but=20
Moore, who has had three recent neck  stingers, probably won't.=20

However, neither man was included  on Friday's list of early inactives (Ric=
ky=20
 Williams and Jake Reed were the only  offensive skill players on that list=
).=20

As stated in USA  Today, WR Joe Horn had 10 catches  for 180 yards against=
=20
the Niners the last time the two teams  met, the third-best receiving yards=
=20
game in club history. He  needs nine receptions to break the Saints=20
single-season record  for catches in one year. Eric Martin holds  the team=
=20
record of 85. Last week, Horn became only the fifth  receiver in club histo=
ry=20
to gain 1,000 receiving yards. Martin  did it three times.=20

According to Pro Football  Weekly, the first person among a throng of =20
well-wishers to meet Saints QB Aaron Brooks  when he got off the plane=20
following the Saints=01, huge Week 13  win in St. Louis was an absolutely=

  travel=20
with the team to the Rams game, Blake continues to make  his presence felt =
in=20
a very high-profile and positive  manner...=20

And finally... PFW also advised  against becoming too excited Haslett=01,s=

[IMAGE]Tim Tyers of the  Arizona Republic reported this  morning that=20
Cardinals quarterback Jake  Plummer's injured ribs didn't allow him  to=20
practice on Friday and whether he plays on  Sunday at Jacksonville will be=
=20
determined by a  dreaded game-day decision, according to head coach  Dave=
=20
McGinnis.=20

"He hasn't been able to  practice for two days, and that's not a good  sign=
,"=20
McGinnis said. "If he's not ready to go,  there's no reason to play him. I'=
m=20
not going to  risk him. It makes no sense."=20

If Plummer can't go,  number-two quarterback Dave  Brown, who is still=20
experiencing soreness  in the left shoulder he injured in his only start  t=
wo=20
weeks ago against the New York Giants, will  start. But McGinnis also=20
guaranteed that if Brown  does start, number-three man Chris  Greisen will=
=20
see extensive action. =20

"It's the first I've  heard of it," Greisen. "I have to be ready, either =

really a problem, it's  a nuisance, and I know it's hurting him a little =

Also of interest... =20

McGinnis said he will  take three running backs with the team to =20
Jacksonville. Michael Pittman  (hyperextended big toe) saw limited duty on=
=20
Friday  but will be available. Backup  Thomas Jones assumed a larger =20
practice role this week, but Clarence  Williams is going for added=20

"Thomas has been fine  the last two days. He seems to be getting a lot =20

Quarterback Jeff  Garcia, who is ranked third in the latest results of  fan=

"If I'm able to be selected to  represent this team in the Pro Bowl, I'd=20

the way he's made all six of his  field-goal attempts, which have ranged=20

locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.

drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

Subject: ArcaMax Weird News for August 11, 2000


   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that "The Muslim's Handbook," written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   "I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes," said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          A MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                                     Sunday, November 5, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  Tuesday is Election Day and I'm asking for your vote.

  Americans are ready for a fresh start. They want a leader
  who trusts them -- not government -- to make decisions for
  their communities.  They want bold leadership that will
  reach across party lines to get things done.

  I am that leader.  I will work to change the tone in
  Washington, D.C. to use these good times for great
  purposes such as reforming public education so every
  child learns to read and creating an environment where
  entrepreneurs and families can flourish and realize their
  dreams.

  I am also committed to providing immediate prescription
  drug coverage for seniors and strengthening our Social
  Security to preserve its benefits for the greatest
  generation and their children and grandchildren.

  This is a close race. Every vote matters. I'm asking for
  your vote and your help.  I urge you to click on this
  link (http://www.georgewbush.com/you.html) for the tools
  that will help you get one undecided voter to vote.
  Please take your family, friends and neighbors to the
  polls to vote for me on Tuesday, November 7th.


  Sincerely,


  George W. Bush
  Governor
  State of Texas


  P.S. If you receive a phone call attacking me or my
  proposals please record it or make note of the attack
  and report it by calling 1-800-878-9374.

SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not
say, Eat me"
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to
please everyone..."
- Bill Cosby...

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact,
Telluride has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the
temperatures have been frigid?which makes for excellent snowmaking
conditions. Winter has come, and you know what that means ? YES! Time to
strap on some boards and make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine
the local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked
out the window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop
with our waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But
when the other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with
the anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak
preview, check out the photo of the day at
www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And
that's what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some
of America's biggest hubs:

Dallas Special:          $831 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing
and roundtrip air to Montrose
Houston Special:    $814 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Chicago Special:    $825 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose
Miami Special:      $929 per person - 5 nights lodging, 4 days skiing and
roundtrip air to Montrose

To get any of these specials, call 1-888-288-7360.

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT'S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski
Resort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that
every lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep.
Lifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing
from beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be "tasty."

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred's, a new
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.
Sophia, Allred's will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the
evenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For
dinner reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It's easier to get to Telluride than ever
before. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on
American Airlines?but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your
body is in one of them!


WHAT'S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November
22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning.
Like the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you
can ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program.
What's it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at
participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can
choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free
half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call
888-288-7360.

And if you're looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and
Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference
Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like
Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was
the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the
Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the
snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran
outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter's absolute
embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built
their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot
nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best
for our snowmen.


AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That's all for this letter. Hope you're planning your trip to Telluride,
where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on
the slopes!

Rosemerry


WHO'S WRITING THIS ANYWAY?
Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six
years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ? in love with the sport. She
lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7?an ideal spot for
getting first chair of the morning.

The homework assignment of the fourth grade
was to have each child get their parents to tell
them a story with a moral at the end of it.

The next day the kids came back and one by
one began to tell their stories.

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have
a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were
taking our eggs to market in a basket on the
front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in
the road and all the eggs went flying and broke
and made a mess."

"And what's the moral of the story?"
Asked the teacher.

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"

"Very good," said the teacher. "Now, Lucy?"

"Our family are farmers too. But we raise
chickens for the meat market. We had a
dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched
we only got ten live chicks. And the moral
to this story is, don't count your chickens
until they're hatched."

"That was a fine story, Lucy. Johnny, do
you have a story to share?"

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story
about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a
flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane
got hit. She had to bail out over enemy
territory and all she had was a bottle of
whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. She
drank the whiskey on the way down so it
wouldn't break and then she landed right in
the middle of 100 enemy troops. She killed
seventy of them with the machine gun until
she ran out of bullets, then she killed twenty
more with the machete till the blade broke
and then she killed the last ten with her
bare hands."

"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher,
"what kind of moral did your daddy tell you
from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Aunt Karen when
she's been drinking."

AND coast-to-coast U.S. travel for $198 roundtrip, or less.

Most of us are busy preparing for the Thanksgiving holiday and clearing
the decks for a  four-day weekend. Bestfares.com will be posting new deals
throughout the holiday, but we=01,ll make this newsletter short and sweet,
whet your appetite with the best of our specials and leave you with room
for delicious desserts of deals. Our hot, new Caribbean sale can save you
up to 60 percent in the most popular travel season, and you still have

many travelers want to warm themselves under the tropical sun. We=01,ll war=

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get
back some of the money the airlines have gotten for your business trips by
using our coast-to-coast $198 Super Sale fares. Access more information at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149
roundtrip; 1,001-1,250 miles for $139 to $169 roundtrip; and over 1,250
miles for $151 to $189 roundtrip. Get the big end of the holiday dinner

ELECTION INTEGRITY UPDATE:

Thanks again for your support,  we've now sent over 270,000
letters to Al Gore urging him to concede for the good of the
country.  Keep the heat on by spreading the word!

Hopefully, the U.S. Supreme Court will throw out the
unwarranted decision of the Florida Supreme Court to force
new recounts of the so-called "undervote."  I'd hate to think
of our next president being decided by Democrat activists
divining the intent of voters who didn't cast a clear vote.

Unfortunately, even if the Supreme Court rules against Al Gore
today or tomorrow, many of his supporters are urging that he
still refuse to concede.

In fact, the Washington Times reports that former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, wants the Gore camp to focus on persuading two or
three Republican electors to defect from Mr. Bush. That would
result in a tie in the Electoral College or even a win for
Mr. Gore.

Here is what Mr. Cuomo had to say:

"There's no guarantee that three or four electors who were
previously supposed to vote for Bush wouldn't turn around, out
of anger and confusion, perhaps, and say, we're going to go
with Al Gore," he said.

Mr. Cuomo openly suggested that if Mr. Gore loses the U.S.
Supreme Court case, the next step for Democrats "could be to
convince some electors previously thought to be committed to
Bush. You only need three to make Al Gore president, even if
he loses Florida. Think about that."

My friend, regardless of whether or not Al Gore officially
supports these actions, there will likely be many attempts to
sway individual electors to overturn the certified election
results.

Political pundits have suggested that if the Supreme Court rules
against him, Al Gore will end the contest of the election
results but will NOT fully concede.  That's not enough.  America
NEEDS a full concession from Al Gore so that we can finally
move on.

But -- as long as Al Gore thinks he has enough public support --
there's no telling how long he'll drag this thing out.  That's
why we are going to keep hammering away with our public call for
Mr. Gore's to concede.

Please continue to send your friends, family and anyone who will
listen to our call for action to sign their letter to Al Gore at
http://www.ElectionIntegrity.com  You're doing great work!


For Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Hi Folks,

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
"It hurts now," Davis said. "It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful."
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
"It didn't affect me at all," he said. "We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay."
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. "That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury," Turner
said. "Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it."

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
"tough guy" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about "leaders stepping
up" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

Hi Folks,

Sorry to send another email but I've had a few AOL folks tell me the
Matchups To Avoid and Exploit reports I sent last night were not readable.
If you were unable to read the email, you can access the Passing Game
Matchups online here http://www.cheatsheets.net/update111700.htm and the
Rushing Game Matchups online here
http://www.cheatsheets.net/update111700b.htm

Apologies for the trouble.  I'm trying to see what's causing this.  If we
have any AOL experts out there who think they can see what's happening, I'd
appreciate your insights.  You can reply to this message.  Thanks.

Players in the News Report is coming soon.

Thanks and I hope you have a great weekend.

Joe

I don't know the YMCA's policy on rain outs so  I will assume that we still 
have a game tonight.  Our game is at 7:45 tonight.  Please let me know if you 
will be there.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
football,
                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
watch.

Enough said.

=09 ?? Todd Davis=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the=
=20
Holiday Bowl. I know that sounds like, "Well, of course, that's what they=
=20
would say." But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the=20
Kansas game by saying if UT won out, they would go to the Holiday Bowl, a=
=20
fun, sunny destination against a top 10 team. Aside from the beach balls an=
d=20
surfing, the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid=20
mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game. For=20
instance, Chris Simms was paid $1,500 by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to=
=20
the Cotton Bowl last year. So he'll really clean up this year. Not that he=
=20
needs it. But you get the picture. It's a way for some of the players to ma=
ke=20
a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the=
=20
mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an=
d=20
pocket the rest. The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on=20
their own. The team will not charter a flight. (All players have to be=20
checked into the team hotel in San Diego by 10 p.m. on Dec. 22). Mack Brown=
=20
wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would w=
in=20
the Big 12 South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top=
=20
10 team. And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team=
.=20
Last year, Texas and its fans couldn't seem to get fired up for an unranked=

think he's a cinch first rounder. Could he go in the top five?   ??=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Hampton could go in the first or second round. The second round=
=20
might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive=20
linemen coming out this year. But Hampton has been really watching his weig=
ht=20
and trying to improve his speed. He promised me that scouts at the NFL=20
combine will be surprised when=20
=09
=09they see him work out. Hampton is a great story. The guy just works his =
tail=20
off and knows that his height (slightly more than 6-1) will probably play=
=20
against him. So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area.=
=20
But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNews.co=

=09
=09 Q: Texas' quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thi=

manufactured by the ill-fated rotation scheme. Now, however, the  quarterba=
ck=20
controversy is real. Texas now has two genuine starting  quarterbacks. Chri=
s=20
Simms is no longer the next boy wonder. He  has arrived. Does ANYONE in the=
=20
nation have a better quarterback  tandem than Texas? How in the world is Ma=
ck=20
Brown going to deal with this?  If they keep the simplified offensive schem=
e=20
next year, do you think the  QB rotation could resurface and actually work?=
 =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penn=
y of=20
his salary because of the quarterback situation. And he'll earn every penny=
=20
again next year. Unless unforseen circumstances, such as injuries, dictate=
=20
otherwise, I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next=20
year. And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms=
=20
next year. He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite, just as=
=20
Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton. If Simms starts t=
he=20
bowl game, and Texas plays well and wins, Simms will have done nothing to=
=20
lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter.=
=20
If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com=
e=20
in and relieve him, then we are back to square one, with both guys battling=
=20
it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter. Texas coaches have=
=20
said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this=
=20
season because of his experience. So we'll see if their stance has changed.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: The 70-yard pump-and-go TD play from Chris Simms  to B.J. Johnson is=
 both=20
a validation of Simms' abilities AND an indictment  of the quarterback=20
rotation. Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played  every=20
offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the=20
defensive  player responsible. To my mind, that is a strong argument agains=
t=20
any kind of QB rotation  scheme. But, on the other hand, how can one NOT wa=
nt=20
to play both of these  immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible?=
=20
Can we get a rule change to allow  two footballs on the field at once (ha=
=20
ha)?   ??=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota=
tion=20
next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris=
h=20
whenever he is on the field. But his comments all season have directly and=
=20
indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence=20
didn't come around until he was taking all the snaps. So I don't know if th=
e=20
coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his=20
confidence.=20

=09[IMAGE] Mack Brown =20
=09
=09Q: What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach? I noticed earl=
ier=20
in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns,=
=20
which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Brown's ability to fire up the tea=
m,=20
assuming that Texas has more talented players. I think that he has proven=
=20
that he can win big games, but he has also had some surprising slipups. Bro=
wn=20
is unquestionably a great recruiter, but do you question his leadership=20
ability on gameday? =20
=09 ?? Andrew Wootton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Up until the Texas Tech game, Mack Brown was saying things like=
 "We=20
could lose any game we play. I just don't know which team is going to show=
=20
up. We could go 6-5 or 9-2." Those kinds of=20
=09
=09comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the=
=20
Longhorns. Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any=
=20
coach I've been around. So when he was saying things like that, it made you=
=20
wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity. Clearly, this ye=
ar=20
was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense. The defens=
e=20
was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge. But the offense really=20
struggled to find an identity. Part of that was the quarterback rotation.=
=20
Part of it was having young receivers, and part of it was having a bunch of=
=20
guys with low-key personalities (i.e. Hodges Mitchell, Leonard Davis, Antwa=
n=20
Kirk-Hughes, Derrick Dockery, Mike Williams etc.). Mack Brown even said it=
=20
was the quietest bunch of offensive players he'd been around. Once Mack Bro=
wn=20
and Co. decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t=
he=20
starter, Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as=
=20
anything else.=20
=09
=09I think Mack Brown is a great coach. Let me say that again. He is a grea=
t=20
coach. I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi=
p=20
on the field. The more he rotated the QBs, the less chance the offense had =
to=20
develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit=
h=20
learning their responsibilities in four-wide as well as trying to adjust to=
=20
having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle. The offensive linemen, earl=
y=20
on, also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi=
m.=20
I'm sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly=
=20
than it did. Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he=20
played Simms more in the Stanford game - an outing in which Applewhite real=
ly=20
struggled until the fourth quarter. Against Oklahoma, the Sooners executed=
=20
flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldn't get up from. It=
=20
was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo=
n=20
in Austin, according to many.=20
=09
=09But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati=
ng=20
out of his hand any time he wants. All he has to do is tune out the negativ=
e=20
comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say,=
=20
"We are doing the best we can. We learn. We make mistakes. We're going to=
=20
keep trying harder." Those are comments no negative fan can argue with.=20
Instead, Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint=20
everything about this season. Each press conference was filled with a comme=
nt=20
about how the media and fans had beat up this year's team. It was=20
contentious. Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times.=20
Paterno hates the media, rarely gives out interviews, etc. So if Mack Brown=
=20
is following in Paterno's footsteps on that issue, it would be a shame.=20
Paterno doesn't have one-quillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow=
n.=20
=09
=09Brown got tough questions during his radio call-in show this season. Som=
e=20
weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others. But a guy like Brown=
=20
is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off=
=20
of his back, use that self-deprecating laugh of his and then take his=20
frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi=
s=20
team into a juggernaut. Mack Brown should know his team's personality going=
=20
into next year because so many players will be back. And he'll have this ye=
ar=20
as a blueprint of how not to do things, in many instances. And he's where h=
e=20
wants to be - at a major college football power and always being in the=20
position of favorite. At North Carolina, as well as he recruited and coache=
d,=20
Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood. At Texa=
s,=20
he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that=
=20
Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big 12. Now, Oklahoma has come=
=20
charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without=20
excuses. If you notice, Stoops didn't gripe about having to play the Big 12=
=20
title game and possibly ruin his team's national title chances. He didn't=
=20
gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in=
=20
Kansas City. He has a tough attitude, and his team has adopted his attitude=
.=20
Brown has a tough attitude, too. And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and=
=20
all of next season will be the truest test of Brown's coaching and dealing=
=20
with expectations. Brown said, fairly and accurately, that Texas couldn't b=
e=20
expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadn't=
=20
finished a season in the top 10 since 1983. "How do you jump to No. 1 witho=
ut=20
having first been in the top 10?" Brown said before the season. Does this=
=20
kind of talk trickle into the ears of players? I don't know. Most of the=20
Longhorns before the season (Applewhite and Hampton included) felt like Tex=
as=20
could win the national title. That's one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam=
e=20
back to Texas this season. When UT lost to Stanford, Brown emerged from an=
=20
emotionally blasted locker room and said, "I didn't think this was a nation=
al=20
title team." He went on to say the team was too young. Are these excuses fo=
r=20
his team? If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl, the Longhorns will hav=
e=20
their top 10 finish and will once again be ranked in the top 10 heading int=
o=20
next season.=20
=09
=09On defense, the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca=
sey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on. But Marcus Tubbs, Adam Doiron a=
nd=20
Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position. Cory=20
Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better, and there is a wealth of=
=20
talent in the seven guys behind them. On offense, the big question mark is =
at=20
running back, where Hodges Mitchell is moving on. He's a guy some Texas fan=
s=20
still think is worthless. But let me tell you, he isn't. He's got guts and=
=20
gave everything he had. It may take some time to see another back who can=
=20
catch and run the way he does. UT will have several backs to pick from,=20
including freshman-to-be Cedric Benson. The rest of the team is proven and=
=20
will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end.=20
=09
=09I don't see any excuses for this team next year. National championship t=
alk=20
will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda. Here's hoping that Mac=
k=20
Brown doesn't let the nitpickers bog him down. And I include myself in that=
=20
group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact=
s=20
- positive or negative. Here's to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time=20
getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl=
e=20
negative angles in a newspaper story. Here's to hoping that he'll take on=
=20
critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily=20

Hi  Folks

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20
Players.? As we head down the home  stretch, identifying those players movi=

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.? =20
Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs as h=
e =20
went 30 for 48.? The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appea=
rs=20
Brooks will continue to air the ball out.? Yes, he'll make some  young QB=
=20
mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as =
he=20
does TDs.? I expect him to throw a lot of both.? I almost  started him over=
=20
Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull the  trigger.? Manning wa=
s=20
solid but Brooks was better.

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here=
=20
he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=
7=20
was no  fluke.? He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked=
=20
out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill=
=20
Cowher or  Stewart)? The TD rush was highlight material.? His problem all=
=20
along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it now.?=
=20
Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=
ut=20
on a  horrid display when he was in the game.? He's  awful.

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks=
=20
ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler "was as pretty as anything Dan=
=20
Marino  ever threw".? Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair=
ly=20
often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going =
to=20
have an  advantage in their cold weather.? Didn't play out that way.?=20
Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.

QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)? We had him high in week 14 like we have all year and=
=20
he  didn't disappoint.? WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently=20
Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.? =
=20
The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded  them=
.

QB Brett Favre  (GB)? I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu=
y=20
just  does what it takes to get the job done.? He'd be much better off if W=
R =20
Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill=20
Schroeder's  doing a great job.?=20

QB Jeff George  (Was)? Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to=20
keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.?=20
George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year.?=20
Although  tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.? I'm =
a=20
Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.? We'll see how=
=20
it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that=
=20
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to=
=20
be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if=
=20
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=
he=20
stretch  run.?=20

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's =
=20
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't =
=20
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says "yes".? Ok, rushing=
=20
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he=
=20
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge=
=20
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as=
=20
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to =
=20
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It look=
s=20
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=
g=20
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed=
=20
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have t=
o=20
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up=
 =20
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for S=
an=20
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=
e=20
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look=
=20
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and=

looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore=
=20
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be =
=20
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total =
=20
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could =
=20
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?=
=20
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=
h=20
a  shot.

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf =
=20
resurgence.? He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues=
 =20
to improve.

WR Willie Jackson  (NO)? Jackson's officially moved past the "flash in the=
=20
pan" stage  with another solid day.? Aaron Brooks continues to look good at=
=20
QB.?  Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no=
w,=20
he's  looking good.

WR Joe Horn  (NO)? Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime =
=20
recipient.? Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should =20
continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20
starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.? He found the endzone again and continues=
=20
to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.

WR Terrell Owens  (SF)? The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a=20
solid day  from Terrell Owens.? He's a huge boost to the offense when he ca=
n=20
go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.? Keep an eye out fo=
r=20
how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just includi=
ng=20
him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =
of=20
choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=
d=20
have no  trouble starting Carswell each week.

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=
e=20
play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB =
=20
Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another=
=20
solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a=
s=20
he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t=
he=20
5 yard  line.

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=
l=20
of play  for all the Saints receivers.? Glover made a couple of nice plays=
=20
Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

?

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his =
=20
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem=
=20
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=
m=20
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the=
=20
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing =
=20
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George =
=20
looks bad for a few series...

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=
ve=20
been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob=20
Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=
.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is=
=20
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some =
=20
frustrations saying for all he knew, "he might be punting this week".? I =
=20
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him=
 =20
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an=
=20
ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well=
=20
that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=
f=20
his  star.? When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess=
=20
with  the one thing that's working.

Philadelphia  RBs? Forget about them.? This team will live and die by =20
Donovan McNabb.

RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)? Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind=20
Terrell Fletcher  now.? That's gotta hurt...

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)? This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu=
s=20
as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto=
r=20
when he  returns.? He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.

WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)? Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in=
=20
a  tailspin.? New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso=
n =20
which could spell more bad things for Mathis.

WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)? Forget about it.? Donovan McNa=
bb=20
can  be a solid QB without WRs.

WRs James McKnight / Wayne  McGarity (Dal)? These guys just aren't very=20
McGood.? QB Troy  Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self.

WR Marcus Robinson  (Chi)? Robinson's back troubles were apparently more=20
serious than  many had expected.? It was announced Monday that he'll likely=
=20
miss the rest  of the season with a bulging disk in his back.? It appears h=
e=20
can get by  without surgery but he's certainly not looking good.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TEs Marcus Pollard / Ken  Dilger (Ind)? Neither of these guys did much=20
Sunday.? This  offense clearly isn't in the same groove it was earlier this=
=20
year.? =20

TEs Jackie Harris / David  LaFleur (Dal)? More bad news associated with Tro=
y=20
Aikman.?  Neither of these guys were much value Sunday and I don't see that=
=20
changing very  quickly.

TE Pete Mitchell  (NYG)? One of the bigger disappointments at TE this seaso=
n,=20
he  just can't get untracked.

To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,


Eric Bass

Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

Love you, Toot

  Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had more
than your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mail
from Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what we
were doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they were
in any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simple
with the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from last
year.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games and
Champagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCC
and find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L

Hi Folks,

Lots of news so let's jump right into it.

Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is out with a broken shoulder. Jim Miller starts
in his absence.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal) will sit with his sore back. Randall Cunningham
will take over the reins this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) was arrested for driving under the influence.
This is not expected to cause any problems for the remainder of this
season.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his sore neck.
Look for the same this week.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) practiced with the second team. He will likely back
up Jim Harbaugh for the remainder of the season.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not expected to play this week. Jon Kitna
returns to the starting job.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out with a broken pinkie. Trent Green starts
in his absence.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced Thursday and is expected to start.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) will miss at least this week's game. He
could
be out from 2-4 weeks. Jeff George gets the start in his absence.

//////////////////////////////

Running Backs in the News:

RB Michael Pittman (Ari) is expected to start with a sore shoulder.
He left practice early Wednesday to receive treatment, but is
expected to play.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is doubtful with a severely sprained toe.

RB Rob Johnson (Buf) is listed as questionable, but he is not
expected to play. QB Doug Flutie will start in his absence.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) had a successful MRI and is expected
to play with his sore ankle.

RB Corey Dillon (Cin) appeared to his assault hearing. His lawyers
got the trial pushed to January 9th so he will not be impacted this
season.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) will return to the lineup with a sore knee.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) practiced Thursday and will return as the
featured back. Mike Anderson will spell Terrell on a few plays a game.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) continues to miss practice and is very
questionable to start this week. If he cannot go, look for Ahman
Green to play in his absence.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

RB Donnell Bennett (KC) could play, but now backs up Tony Richardson.
He has no fantasy value.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) practiced and is expected to play with his
hurt shoulder.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is expected to play with a sore knee.

RB Bernie Parmalee (NYJ) will play if needed.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is listed as questionable on the injury
report with a sore ankle, but is expected to play.

RB Natrone Means is close to being signed by Philadelphia.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week.

RB Jerome Bettis (Pit) is expected to play with his sore quad.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.

RB Ricky Watters (Sea) has not practiced and could be a game-time
decision. Coach Holmgren has indicated that he believes Watters will
be ready to play with pain on Sunday.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) returned to practice this week, but the team
has not commented whether he will rejoin the team this season or not.

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) has an assortment of ailments, but he is
expected to play through the pain. He is holding off surgery until
the end of the season.

RB Marshall Holcombe (StL) is questionable with a sore hamstring.

RB Trung Canidate (StL) is almost 100%, but he has lost the back up
spot to Justin Watson.

RB Eddie George (Ten) practiced Thursday, but remains questionable
for this week. He plays hurt so he will likely go again this week.

//////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Travis Taylor (Bal) is out with a broken clavicle.

WR Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore hamstring.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is not expected to play this week.

WR David Patten (Cle) will likely play a limited role this week with
his sore toe.

WR Chris Cole (Den) has a hurt elbow and does not look to see any
significant playing time.

WR Robert Brooks (Den) will play with his sore hamstring. But it
remains to be seen if Brian Griese will throw the ball to any
receiver not named Smith or McCaffrey.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out with a broken foot. Johnnie Morton
and Herman Moore continue to start in his absence.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac) will use this week's bye week to get healthy.

WR Keenan McCardell (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

WR Slvester Morris (KC) could use a week off to heal his shoulder,
but will likely play against rival Oakland this week. If he cannot
go, look for Kevin Lockett to start in his absence.

WR Tony Martin (Mia) is not expected to play with a sore foot. Oronde
Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will start again this week.

WR Bert Emanuel (Mia) is listed as questionable on the injury report.
He will likely play if needed.

WR Randy Moss (Min) was fined $25,000 for his contact with an
official last week.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out.

WR Joe Horn (NO) is listed as questionable, but has practiced and is
expected to start.

WR Keith Poole (NO) will likely play with a sore neck. He appears to
be over his concussion symptoms.

WR Windrell Hayes (NYJ) is not expected to play this week.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ) is expected to play with his bruised shin.

WR Jerry Porter (Oak) has been on the injury report nearly every week
with a sore hamstring. In related news, he was seen dressed as Yancey
Thigpen at a local Halloween party in Oakland.

WR Andre Rison (Oak) is expected to play with a sore toe.

WR Troy Edwards (Pit) is expected to play with his sore hip.

WR Hines Ward (Pit) is expected to play with his sore back.

WR Derrick Mayes (Sea) has been named the starter opposite of Sean
Dawkins this week. Rookie Darrell Jackson moves to the #3 WR.

WR Karl Williams (TB) practiced and will play if needed.

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is banged up with a sore back and ankle, but
will likely start.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) will likely play, but may not start.

WR Yancey Thigpen (Ten) is questionable with a sore hamstring. Do not
count on him playing.

WR Irving Fryar (Was) is listed as questionable. If he plays, he will
likely be the #3 WR behind dinged up receivers Albert Connell and
James Thrash.

//////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Chris Gedney (Ari) is questionable with sore ribs.

TE Wesley Walls (Car) has been lost for the season.

TE Kris Mangum (Car) is not expected to play.

TE Kyle Brady (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ) is not expected to play this week. Fred Baxter
will start in his place.

TE Mark Bruener (Pit) is expected to play with his sore hip.

//////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK Mike Hollis (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

PK Jaret Holmes (NYG) can play, but it remains unclear whether he
will be used or if the team will go with Brad Daluiso again this
week. Both of these players are probably worth avoiding this week.

PK John Hall (NYJ) is expected to play with a sore quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (StL) is expected back next week. Pete Stoyanovich
will kick for the Rams this week.

How about a practice on Wednesday and a scrimmage with the other UT team on 
Thu??  I think that would produce the best results.

Scrimmages are fun and all but we need to practice - several times this 
week.  I am serious about these tickets, so I want to practice as much as 
possible between now and Saturday.  Let's set something up for tonight and 
tomorrow night!  
I have asked Chris Gaskill (Ex- UT baseball player) to play, he is going to 
let me know ASAP.  So, if either of you know him, give him a call.

Let me know about practice.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

Hi Everyone,

Well, it's official.  I am finally making the final arrangements for my move 
to London!  I leave Friday, July 14th, but before I go I would like to throw 
a going away bash.  It's been awhile since we've all been out together so I 
hope you can make it.  I am sure that I have forgotten people, so please 
forward the email on.

The festivities will commence at my apartment next Friday, July 7th....at my 
apartment.  I'll be providing beer and wine but feel free to bring your 
favorite beverage.  I live a block away from the Galant Knight...if you can't 
make it to the apartment, meet up with us at the Galant Knight on Holcombe.

I live at 7777 Greenbriar #3056.  My gate code is 284.  If you need 
directions, leave me a message on my voice mail and I'll call you 
back...since I will out on vacation for most of next week.

I hope to see you all!

Carrie

I've reviewed the rules and brackets.... 

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page.

1
STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER III

The American people voted on November 7.  Governor George W.
Bush won 31 states with a total of 271 electoral votes.  The
vote in Florida was very close, but when it was counted,
Governor Bush was the winner.

Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted.
Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing
the recount are Democrats.

At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner,
subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which have
traditionally favored the Republican candidate.  No evidence of
vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has
been presented.

Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in
selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there
were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the
recount.

It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly
prolong the country's national Presidential election through
endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida.

Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially
by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost
ballots, and other risks, will be introduced.  This frustrates
the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to
machine counting.

Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot.
There is a rule of law to be followed for elections.  The state
of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve,
publish and, if need be, to protest ballots before the election.
The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor.
She approved it.  The Democratic Party did not question it
before the election.  This "butterfly"-type ballot was used in
recent elections in the same county under the same rules.  Again,
the Democrats did not complain.  The overwhelming majority of
voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes.
Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot, and we
have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you
to see.

The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that
double marked ballots are not counted.  A key principle in
America is one person, one vote.  If we have ballots with two
votes, of course we cannot count them or guess about them.
Ballots that are double-marked can't be evidence of the voter's
intent to vote one way or another.  No jurisdiction in the
United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote, and
Florida law specifically does not.  It happens in every
precinct in every election.  And the procedure is clear:  These
ballots must be disregarded.

We understand, and I understand personally, that it is
frustrating to lose by a narrow margin.  But it happens.  It
happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in 1960 and
1976.  Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the
country's interest first.  They accepted the vote for the good
of the country.

It is important that there be some finality to the election
process.  What if we insisted on recounts in other states that
are very close?  For example, in Wisconsin, Iowa, (and if we
don't win) New Mexico.

Let the country step back a moment, pause, and think about
what's at stake.  This may be the last chance.  There is no
reasonable end to this process if it slips away.

The purpose of our national election is to establish a
"Constitutional government," not unending legal wrangling.  We
will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaign's efforts to
keep recounting until it likes the result.  For the good of the
country and the sake of our standing in the world, the
campaigning should end, and the business of an orderly
transition should begin.

_________________________________________________________________

STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES:

"The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won
Florida's election, and a recount has now confirmed his victory.
The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee
ballots, which in the past have favored Republican candidates.
Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in 1996 by a
margin of 54 to 40 percent, even though he lost the election in
Florida.  We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will
reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts,
which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a
President and has no foreseeable end."

DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING

"Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, questioned the
Gore campaign's wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result.
The right thing, Mr. Breaux said, 'is to count the votes and
respect the decision,' without lengthy litigation. And Senator
Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, warned against
getting mired in the courts...

"'I want Al Gore to win the election,' Mr. Torricelli told
reporters, 'but more than that, I want somebody to win this
election. There is going to have to be a very compelling case
for anybody to take this into a court of law.'"

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, OTHERS: REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY
POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE

"The problem is that potential remedies, such as a new election
in Palm Beach County, seem politically unsound and legally
questionable. The sad reality is that ballot disputes and
imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison
the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in
particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for

"We say yes to counting a little more, but the legal action
about which Mr. Daley spoke elliptically should be approached
with enormous caution and restraint. Absent more than is
currently known, our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat
vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely
resolve; the courts in the end can't legitimize the results."
- Washington Post, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57302-2000Nov9.html


"Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida
election.  It is important to decide this election by the rules
that 100 million Americans understood -- or should have
understood -- when they entered the voting booth Tuesday.  This
is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W. Bush. It
is about defending a system that regards voting-day verdicts as
the final word, a concept that distinguishes this nation from
most others in the world."
- San Francisco Chronicle, Editorial, 11/9/00


"'You know, I don't think the ballot was a problem, Bill and
I'll tell you why-is that there's one section I don't know if
people are really looking at, which relates to electronic or
electromechanical voting.  And in that particular case, what
the law says down here, it says 'Voting squares may be placed
in front of or in back of the names of candidates and
statements.'"
- CNN's "Crossfire," Greta Van Susteren,  11/09/00


"If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because
of confusion, I think that cases like that could be brought all
over the country."
- CNN's Larry King Live, Bill Schneider, 11/8/00

I am trying to organize everybody's turret so that we have all of the Texas 
Desk people on one page.  This will be especially beneficial for when we have 
people out.  The phone guys are going to completely wipe out what you 
curretnly have on Page 6, so if there is anything other than Texas Desk 
employees, let me know so that they don't get deleted.  

I would also like to reserve some space on Page7 for the rollover lines, so 
ditto with Page 7 as with Page 6.

Let's put a deadline of December 1st for this .... that should be enough time 
for you busy people to let me know if there's a problem.  I'd like to have 
this done on December 4th.

Thanks,
Laura

** High Priority **

Subject: OU & A&M Football Game


College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. "The end
zones were confusing," says Slocum. "I'm sure that some of the
touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous". "They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have
said so before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy
with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over
thirty-five points many times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well  as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will
be the winner of the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. "All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. "We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been
premature in our prediction."

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 
 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday 
for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the 
Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on 
the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small 
forward position for Washington.  

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 
 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, 
less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery 
in the offseason.  The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those 
Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on 
the shelf once again until he is healthy.   

 Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 
 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee.  He 
has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 
rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to 
play against the Clippers on Wednesday night.    

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's 
game against the Nets.  He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to 
Miami, on the Pistons' roster.  Barros likely won't see enough playing time 
to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim.     

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping 
Williams.  The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the 
Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey 
Maggette and Tyrone Nesby.  Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus 
far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games.  A trade 
to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to 
consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality.    

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 
 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in 
motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his 
scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track.  "If he gets his 
mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years 
ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will 
inspire him," said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value 
could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next 
few days.    

 Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived 
by the team on Monday.  He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his 
right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson.  
Kerner was of no Fantasy value.    

 Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 
 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie 
Ward on the roster.  Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 
1998-2000.  He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was 
waived on Nov. 21.  He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 
minutes per game in Boston.  Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the 
Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him.  

 Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after 
suffering an ankle injury.  He hasn't been too productive lately since being 
removed from the regular frontcourt rotation.   

 Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's 
road game against the Knicks.  If he is unable to play Doug West will 
probably start at shooting guard.    

 Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage 
in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning.  
With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to 
search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon.    

 Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday.  He 
averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the 
Hornets to a 4-0 week.  Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early 
in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your 
league.    

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 
 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an 
injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls.  He won't travel with the 
team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington.  
With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for 
Carter until he is healthy.       

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 
 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position 
in Monday's game against Vancouver.  In what has been called the "big 
backcourt," Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the 
shooting guard.  Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he 
could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point 
guards.     

 Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 
 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the 
Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' 
two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring 
punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup 
change.      

 Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle.  
He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt 
that he would do the team more harm than good by playing.  Despite the 
injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday.  With the success of 
so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his 
Fantasy value.  He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners 
in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster.    

 Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies.  He 
sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter.  
Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value 
in most leagues.  His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers 
is uncertain.     

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the 
Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime.  X-rays on Atkins' 
ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New 
Jersey is still unknown.    

 Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games 
with a knee injury.  He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on 
September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics.  Unless you are 
desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of 
Fantasy.     

 Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 
 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee 
against Atlanta on Wednesday night.  He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds 
in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 
 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the 
Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. 
The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. 
Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by 
swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn 
hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. 
 

 Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 
 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of 
his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman 
Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on 
the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated.   

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 
 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday 
night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The 
fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller.   
McGrady's status is day-to-day.    

 Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 
 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to 
repair frayed cartilage.   Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the 
source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst 
near the rear of the knee joint.   Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 
before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 
weeks.    

 Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee 
Bucks.  He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no 
real Fantasy value.     

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 
 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee.   DeMarr Johnson will probably 
start at shooting guard in his place.  Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the 
only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently.     

 Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 
 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday 
before their game against Toronto.  Terry Mills was activated form the list 
to take Perkins' place on the roster.  Jermaine O'Neal will start at center 
in Perkins' absence.     

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 
 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left 
ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is 
probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 
 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had 
been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, 
keep him in your active lineup.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 
 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will 
be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in 
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list 
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of 
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final 
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after 
the All-Star break.

Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers

the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

year.  The entry fee is $25.  Money and picks are due Monday December 18th.

Hi Folks,

Again this week our own Cheatsheets.net Meteorologist, Mike McVay from
WOWK - TV offers his expert insights on the weather conditions that may
affect your players this week.  It's early but here are some potential
situations to keep an eye on.

WASHINGTON @ PITTSBURGH:  Saturday will bring a chance of snow to
Pittsburgh.  Both teams will likely run the ball any way, but the weather
could reinforce the ground game in this one.

NEW ENGLAND @ BUFFALO:  A chance for snow showers in Buffalo this weekend.
No surprise here.  Both teams adapt to these conditions so I don't expect
any changes in offensive schemes, but Vinatieri and Christie might not be
great options in this one.

DETROIT @ NEW YORK JETS:  Rain changing to snow in New York Sunday.  Looks
kind of messy but this is a must win for both teams.  Should be a fun game
to watch, but frustrating if you have fantasy players on either team.

TENNESSEE @ CLEVELAND:  Much like Buffalo, you can generally expect snow in
Cleveland this time of the year....and the Browns last game of 2000 will be
no exception.  Wind could be a factor in this game if you have either Del
Greco or Kevin Johnson (he's not used to passing in these kind of
conditions).

Mike McVay
StormTracker13
Meteorologist
WOWK-TV


One other note to think about is the terrible condition of Paul Brown Field
in Cincinnati where the Bengals host Jacksonville this week.  Thanks to my
friend John Pflum for the insights as he tells me the transplanted grass has
basically died and between the hashmarks is a total mess.  Could especially
be a factor for the kickers.  Just a thought.

See you Thursday morning with our cheatsheet rankings and Friday morning
with the Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.

Joe

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

GORE CLAIMS TO WANT EVERY VOTE COUNTED, BUT REFUSES TO STOP
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO THROW OUT LEGAL VOTES FOR BUSH

Al Gore, News Conference, CNN, 11/27/00:
"Ignoring votes means ignoring democracy itself, and if we ignore
the votes of thousands in Florida in this election, how can you or
any American have confidence that your vote will not be ignored in
a future election?"

THE TRUTH:
 ~ If Gore wants all votes counted, ought to urge dismissal of
   their case.

 ~ The voters did nothing wrong - it was the result of computer
   error.  In an effort to make sure that voters received their
   ballots, local Republicans asked the Supervisor of Elections
   if they could manually fix the misprints - suit would
   disenfranchise 15,000 voters.

 ~ Democrats are trying to throw out all 15,000 absentee votes in
   Seminole County, even though less than 5,000 of the absentee
   ballot applications required correction, just to obtain a net
   gain of votes for Gore in Seminole County.

 ~ The number was on an APPLICATION, not on a ballot.

 ~ Both parties sent out materials like this.  A computer glitch
   caused approximately 5,000 Republican absentee requests to
   contain incorrect voter registration numbers.

 ~ This has NOTHING to do with the integrity of the ballots or the
   validity of votes.

LEGAL INFORMATION

 ~ No traction for the legal claim.

 ~ State law in no way bars what took place.

 ~ Merely corrected a Voter ID Number on an application.

 ~ Control on application is voter's signature and last four digits
   of Social Security Number which must be included and is provided
   by the voter.

 ~ Voter ID Numbers are public information

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT RULES THE PALM BEACH BALLOT IS LEGAL

Florida Supreme Court Ruling:
"[W]e conclude as a matter of law that the Palm Beach County
ballot does not constitute substantial noncompliance with the
statutory requirements mandating the voiding of the election."
 - Andre Fladell v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, 12/01/00


Gore's Legal Team Insisted The Ballot Was Illegal:

Former Secretary of State And Gore Advisor Warren Christopher:
"...there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting
from the ballot...that ballot was confusing and illegal, and that
rising out of this is the need for redress in order to make sure
that the will of the people can be properly honored..."
   - News Conference on Florida Recount, CNN, 11/09/00

GORE ASKED MIAMI MAYOR WHY MIAMI-DADE RECOUNT STOPPED

Miami Herald's Manny Garcia and Joseph Tanfani, 12/01/00:
"Hours after the Miami-Dade canvassing board called off its
recount, Gore phoned county Mayor Alex Penelas (D) asking for an
explanation.  Penelas said Gore 'asked him if 'there was anything
I could do to provide extra resources' to help the count go
forward.' Penelas also said 'Gore 'never pressured me''"

NOTABLE COLUMNS

Washington Post
COUNTING ON SOME SLIPPERY LANGUAGE
George F. Will
11/30/00

"...despite the supposed sophistication of Boies, Gore &
Lieberman, all its arguments have rested on two braided
assertions, each too weak to gain significant strength from the
braiding:

"First, anything done with a ballot constitutes a cast vote.
Second, no vote can be considered counted until a presidential
intent has been ascribed to it, even if the ascription involves
intuiting the meaning of 'marks...barely discernible to the
human eye' (the words of Judge Charles Burton, who presided over
Palm Beach County's recount).

"Beneath such result-oriented lawyers' artistry lurks a
pernicious premise. It is that casting a ballot is a task so
challenging for many voters that the task cannot be completed
without the intervention of lawyers-as-intuitors.  This soft
bigotry of low expectations infused Al Gore's eerie speech
Monday evening."

HUNDREDS OF FELONS CAST VOTES ILLEGALLY: Since 1868, it has been
illegal for felons to cast ballots in Florida.
David Kidwell, Phil long and Geoff Dougherty
12/01/00

Excerpts:
"At least 445 Florida felons voted illegally on Nov. 7...

"The tainted votes -- found in a review of nearly half a million
votes cast in 12 Florida counties -- provide evidence that the
presidential race was influenced by thousands of ineligible
voters. Nearly six million voters in Florida's 67 counties cast
ballots.

"Nearly 75 percent of the illegal ballots discovered by The
Herald were cast by registered Democrats.

"The votes could be seized upon by the Bush campaign to argue
that a large number of illegal votes were probably cast for his
opponent, outweighing the effect of any recount.

"'It's a very powerful argument,' said Robert Jarvis, a law
professor at Nova Southeastern University.

"The Herald found 62 robbers, 56 drug dealers, 45 killers, 16
rapists and seven kidnappers who cast ballots. At least two who
voted are pictured on the state's online registry of sexual
offenders.

"Clarence Eden Williams, 77, of Pahokee, also voted. His picture
is posted on the state registry of sexual offenders for his
crimes against children. His son was surprised his father cast a
ballot.

"'He's got Alzheimer's, and he can't even carry on a
conversation anymore,' said Clarence Williams III.

"The Herald review included...8 percent of the 5.9 million votes
cast on Nov. 7. It encompassed all votes cast in Palm Beach and
Pasco counties, most votes cast in Duval County, and only
absentee votes in Miami-Dade, Broward, Lee, Leon, Hillsborough,
Clay and the Panhandle counties of Escambia, Okaloosa and Bay.

"To find felony voters, The Herald compared a list of voters in
those counties with a Department of Corrections database listing
felons who had served at least a year in prison. If the pattern
found in the study is the same statewide, more than 5,000 felons
likely cast illegal ballots."

THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY
John McIntyre
11/30/00

For the past three weeks all we have heard from Democrats and
the media about the struggle in Florida is that "both sides are
at fault," "neither candidate has been presidential," and "a pox
on both your houses." This case for moral equivalency between
Bush and Gore is critical to the Democrats' argument. If, as the
rationale goes, both sides are to blame and the election ended
in a tie, then "why can't we just have a compromise that affords
both sides with a 50/50 chance win the Presidency?" This would
seem like a reasonable solution, provided those underlying
suppositions were true. The problem for Gore is that the
suppositions are not even close to being true. Both sides are not
to blame. And this election, while ridiculously close, did not
end a tie.

Vice President Gore had a right to conduct a recount of the
votes. He has had that recount of votes. When the recount upheld
the original result, that should have been the end of this
fiasco. However, even before the original recount was finished,
Gore, and his partner in crime Senator Lieberman, decided in
their minds that they really won the election. What has followed
has been their all-out assault to change what happened on
election day in Florida.

If it works for politics, it should work for sports...


NEW YORK  --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to court to 
get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World Series. The 
batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference 
earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. 

"We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets 
batting coach. "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we 
received and believe we have been denied our right to hit." 

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had 
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.  It was 
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls,  though a 
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. 

Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively 
reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in 
fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. 

"The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of  our 
right to hit," said the Mets batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet 
and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely." 

Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games 
and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. 
"While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, 
there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series," the 
commissioner said. 

Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base 
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the 
final scores of the games. "It's clear that we were slightly on-base more 
often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman. "The World Series crown is 
rightly ours." 

The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some 
light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes "we need to let 
the process run its course without a rush to judgment."

I am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order.  Some, have said 
that it is not fair for Steve to be handed the 6th slot.  Let me know what 
you think.

I've had lots of folks ask for more details on the story I reported Monday
night as Denver QB Brian Griese made my "Downgrade" list in the "Upgrades /
Downgrade" article.

According to John Clayton of ESPN, Griese's shoulder injury is a separation
of the AC joint in his right clavicle.  He took a pain killing shot and
finished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against
San Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will
be a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.

I've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like
this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.
Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket
because he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an
eye on it for you as this shakes out.

Joe



>From the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html
DENVER -- Brian Griese had a secret. Mike Shanahan knew because he was the
head coach. Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of
his right shoulder.
His teammates didn't know what went on behind closed doors in Monday's
dramatic 27-24 Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium. All
his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an
ill-advised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter.
Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasn't missed. The
Raiders had an 11-play, field-goal drive that lasted six minutes. Teammates
saw Griese trot back to the field, warm up and miss only five plays. They
didn't hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and
needed a pain-deadening shot to finish the final three quarters.
"This is not a game I wanted to miss, and I was going to do anything
possible to get in the game and help my team win," Griese said. "I was going
to do it. It was just the will to play and the will to win, and I wasn't
going to come out."
An hour after the game, Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran
their huddle had a busted wing. His performance was John Elway-like for
courage, but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese
available as a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Diego
Chargers.
"We won't know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury, but he's
such a competitor," Shanahan said. "He's been like that since he's been
here. He wants to play, and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure
he doesn't further hurt himself. That's the kind of guy he is."
Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy. Last
year was different. In the preseason, it was supposed to be Bubby Brister's
team, but Shanahan named Griese the starter. Veterans didn't feel totally
comfortable with him. Griese didn't feel comfortable bossing around a group
of players who didn't take to him.
"Brian's the one to lead us," Smith said. "I think it would have hurt him
more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing
with the shoulder the way it was. Whatever he does, he doesn't surprise me.
He's the best quarterback in the NFL. I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon
is. We think Brian is."
Griese told his offensive players that he didn't have too much zip on the
ball. They accepted it as just humility.
"I wasn't throwing the ball as well I have been," Griese said. "Some of the
balls just died. At that point, it was just your will to play, your will to
win. I wasn't coming out of the game."
Griese was 22-of-32 for 221 yards with a separated shoulder. He'd throw
passes and hear, as well as feel, his shoulder popping in and out.
"I knew there was something wrong with it, but they assured me that I
couldn't do any further damage," Griese said. "It was just whether I could
handle the pain."
Being injured didn't make Griese shy away from contact. Several times he
took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High
Stadium grass. Once, cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the
blindside. Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high.
"Believe it or not, the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I
heard the crowd, and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that,"
Griese said. "I said to myself, 'Well, somebody must be ready to hit me.' "
Talk about homefield advantage. Griese has never had an injury like this. He
has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that
requires surgery, but this was much more painful.
Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big
play. He had to make just an arm-through pass. It was agonizing. He threw a
skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the
chin.
"I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I
didn't have any zip on the ball," Griese said.
Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different.
"We knew it was something that was hurting him, we knew he was banged up,"
fullback Howard Griffith said. "That's how it is when you've got a job to
do."
Still, the story told after the game amazed them.

A guy brings his girlfriend back to her home after being out on a date.
They reach the
front door, he leans with one hand on the wall, looks into her eyes and
says, "Sweetie,
why don't you give me a blow job?"
"What? You're crazy!" she replies.
"Don't worry, it will be quick, no problem!"
"No!! Someone may see; a relative, a neighbor..."
"At this time of the night, no one will show up," he adds.
"I've already said NO, so NO!"
"Honey, it's just a small blowie, I know you'll like it too!"
"NO!!! I've said NO!!!"
"My love, don't be like that, come on!"
At this moment the girls sister shows up at the door in her nightgown
with her hair totally
in disorder, rubbing her eyes and says, "Dad says either You have to
blow him, I have to
blow him, or He will come down and give him a blow job himself, but for
God's sake, tell
your boyfriend to take his hand off the intercom!"

		 Subject: Re: FYI

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour" which 
will be paid for by Brian "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12" 
Hoskins.

Place and time TBD

With all of the HYPE surrounding the Big 12 this season....

Nine SEC teams are going to bowls, an unprecedented number of bowl-bound 
teams from a single conference in NCAA history.

Well, the closest one I know is the Crescent Court and that is REAL nice and
REAL expensive.  There are La Quintas and other shitty places scattered all
around there.  Of course in Downtown Dallas you could probably find quite a
few decent places to stay and that is real close to the cotton bowl.  Here
are some other possibilities:

Saturday would be good for me if you can squeeze it in.  I am going to see
Dad tonight.  I will be there at about 7.

Where are you going to be, that puts you on that side of town?

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Dear Loving Son,

I'm glad you are having a good month.  That does not surprise me.  Perhaps
we should turn what's left of your inheritance over to you to invest.  Just
kidding.  Dad is doing a great job but this market is really jittery over
this election mess - thanks to the Dems.

Bi-weekly sounds good.  Let's do that.

Have a great day.  Talk to you later.  LU-Mom

Dan,

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Eric Bass

Good evening. I am hopeful it is no big deal. This is a spot on my left leg.
I had a biopsy a couple of weeks ago and this spot is very active. So, they
have scheduled surgery on Thursday. It is Moies Surgery. They take out the
obvious contaminated area, immediately do an analysis, and if there is still
contamination on any part, they go back in an take out more until the lab
test are clean. Will not know how much leg they take until it is all over.
So, if you have a peg leg that you are not using, I may need to borrow it. I
do not expect any complications. Will let you know the results Thursday p.m.
Love you-Dad

Hey Lisa,

Long time no hear!  I guess you are too cool for all of us little people now.

Brenda is looking for someone to fill Bryan Hull's spot in risk when he 
leaves.  I know that you are looking for a rotation, so I was wondering if 
you have an interest.

Let me know.


Eric

Subject: 6th Annual Party

This is special advanced notice for people who have kids or like to plan 
things in advance.  I'll resend out the week of the party.
********
You are all cordially invited to attend the following engagement.  Please 
bring friends and forward this to anyone I may have missed accidentally.

When: Saturday, January 29th-NEXT WEEKEND, not this Weekend.. no one will be 
there!

What:  6th annual John, Robert & Mo's Party (just 5th annual for me).  2kegs, 
assorted mixed beverages, and mystery snacks will be on hand.

Where: 6422 Wister Ln, 77008 713-869-6312, map below.
http://www.mapquest.com/cgi-bin/ia_find?link=ia-map-result&uid=u7o60vbdhc21l1z
j:a5hzz0uw2

Time: Whenever till Whenever.

Why:  Why not.

Here is a friendly disclaimer from one of our hosts:

You all know what this is about! Let's set aside this evening to hearken back 
to our younger days... when peer pressure was still cool. Experienced 
IDHAFR's can attest, this is no "Company Cocktail Buffet". IDHAFR newbies 
will just have to take our word for it. Last year I said, "we'll see what new 
lows we can achieve"... Little did I know!!!!!  Dolls in the freezer, RIVER 
DANCING... ON THE FURNITURE (picture my head held in shame). I will make no 
such prediction this year. I can't even promise that there will be a Man in 
Black. But I can promise you'll be sorry you missed it!

We hope this notice finds everyone in good health and spirits this new 
millennium (actually that's still a year away but...) So mark your calendar: 
(Out of town guests are surely welcome, sleeping (?) arrangements can always 
be found. Although I must say I didn't like having to share the space under 
the pool table in '96!)

You will probably have to park far away.  Neighbors are pretty friendly.

Earl,

James McKay referred me to you for information regarding historical 
throughput numbers on HPL.  Ed Gottlob and I are looking at ways to hedge the 
pipe and need this data as far back as can accurately be obtained.

Thanks,


Eric

Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to "Certify the Bush
Victory."

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative "hand-counting" techniques
to convert so-called "dimpled chads" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be "listening to the will of the
people."  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

Subject: A$M and its "second tier" status



Hate to promote the obvious.  US News & World Reports has their most current 
college rankings out, and, yes, Texas is in the top 50 schools in the 
country.  A$M in the meantime has returned to their fabled "second tier" 
status where all "second tier" schools belong.  I don't really care if Texas 
Monthly prints a huge front page article that says "UT....THE BEST SCHOOL IN 
TEXAS".....Of course Texas Monthly would never do that because IT ISN"T 
NEWS!!!!!!!   Tell us something we don't know!  You will recall that a couple 
of years ago, Texas Monthly reported that a$m was "the best school in Texas", 
relying on US NEWS & WORLD REPORTS rankings.  I guess that was short lived.

Whoops.  Looks like a$m is STILL ranked considerably lower than Texas in both 
Business and Engineering, in spite of the fact that every agroid will tell 
you differently.

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.



IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


>From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...


===


If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb 
Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.


We spot them:  Total Bet:

9 pts   $50

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

on the routers, and replacing
route inside 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 172.16.21.1 1

Hey guys,

     I had to send this to the world!  This is one of those rare Emails that 
had
me running through the house at break-neck speed, laughing my head off the
entire way.  It takes a little while to boot up, but it's worth the wait. It
should be self-explanatory.  Enjoy!

Dear Eric,

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election
at ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

For Election Integrity,
Bruce Eberle

Subject: Unbiased media coverage of the election...
---------------------------------------------------------

Dear Bruce,

The liberal media is at it again.

They used every trick in the book to try to help Al Gore win
on election night.

And following a vote that didn't come out the way the
liberal media wanted it to... the media used their massive
influence to drum up controversy in Florida to try to
overturn the whole election.

On election night, the network media shamefully tried to
influence the election by declaring Al Gore the winner in
Florida before the polls were closed in that state -- and
hours before the polls were closed in the rest of the
country.

And the media all but declared Gore to be the overall winner
based on his "win" in Florida and other early states.

This clearly biased move led to thousands of discouraged
George W. Bush voters in Florida and other swing states to
leave long poll lines BEFORE they voted.

Who knows what the outcome might have been in Florida and
other swing states such as New Mexico, Oregon, and
California if the media had not falsely declared Gore to be
Florida's winner so early.

And then the media tried to overturn the most crucial swing
state -- Florida -- by inventing controversy and scandal
there.

The liberal media has always been biased...

.. but never before have they so blatantly tried to rig an
election in favor of their liberal candidate.

And who knows what tricks they may still have up their
sleeve to overturn the election and put Al Gore in the
White House.

Believe me, until the last Gore lawsuit is dismissed, the
liberal media will cling to the hope of getting their man
elected despite the actual outcome of the election.

That's why Radio America is so important.

Radio America is the one national media source that is
giving truthful, unbiased election information.

Radio America is a non-profit radio network that broadcasts
nationwide 24 hours a day.  We represent the views of
Americans like you.  That's why we're called "The Voice of
Main Street America."

During all the controversy and confusion surrounding this
election, you can count on Radio America to cut through the
liberal bias and broadcast the truth.

And now you can listen to Radio America on-line over your
computer.

That's right, you can hear our unbiased, no-nonsense news
and reporting over the internet 24 hours a day.

To find out how you can listen to Radio America, just click
on the link below.

Please don't let the liberal news media go unopposed.

For America,
Jim Roberts, President of Radio America

P.S. This is vitally important for the future of America.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone you know who cares
about saving this election from being stolen by the liberal
media!

Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no 
longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to 
see how you fare against a top 5 team.

Maybe we will see you next year.  Of course, you will have to make it to the 
Rose Bowl.

Good luck in Dallas!

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning 
of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most 
overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any 
time Texas is challenged they "you-know-what" their pants.

Subject: Re: It could happen!!!  

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Eric,

 On deal 117413 for Dec 99, could you change the first tier from 750,000 to 
775,000?  The volume is the first 25,000/d.   I need this in order to get the 
Unify invoice to come out correctly.

Thanks,
Kyle

ADD TO THE PLAYOFF FUN

Why leave some teams on the sideline come playoff time? The
league's commissioner can schedule "consolation" matchups
during the playoff tournament. In the Front Office, go to
Schedule, Matchups and choose the week(s) that your
playoffs take place. Under "Other Games," you can set any
matchups you want. If there are two teams that split the
regular season series, here's a great way to settle the
score. Of course, these matchups won't count toward your
league's "official" championship, but they prolong the
season, and the fun, for those teams that came up short.


STAY ON TOP OF ALL PLAYER INJURY INFO

As the season winds down and your team battles for playoff
positioning, it's more important than ever to have the
latest injury news. Your league's web site contains all the
injury information you need to make informed lineup
decisions. For a snapshot view of all recent player
injuries and status, go to Scouting Reports, Injuries. Go
to Scouting Reports, Player Updates for continually updated
news and fantasy analysis for all NFL players. To see the
most recent updates for the players on your team, go to
Teams, Player News. Also, monitor our News, NFL News page
for weekly Q&A sessions and "Injury Roundup" columns from
Steve Cohen, CBS SportsLine's pro football injury guru.


MILLER LITE

The tab for SportsLine's FREE Fantasy Football is being
picked up by Miller Lite, our favorite beer around here.
Check them out offline at your local bar or online with us.
Grab a Miller Lite. It's Miller Time!

http://cbs.sportsline.com/links/2/60/fantasyfb1110miller.cgi


FOLLOW THE LEADERS

Using the Statistics, Leaders link, you can find out the
leading players in any statistical category. Just choose a
statistic in the listbox above the report, click GO, and
the current leaders will be displayed. It's a great way to
find the best free agent, or trade possibility, if you need
to fill a late-season need or replace one of your injured
starters.


PLANTERS

Football Season is Planters Season. Don't get left on the
sidelines. Planters brings you TWO ways to win! Click here:

http://cbs.sportsline.com/links/2/60/fantasyfb1110planters.cgi


COMPLETE SUNDAY NFL COVERAGE

You never have to leave your league's web site for complete
coverage during Sunday's games. If you can manage to peel
yourself away from Live Scoring, check Scouting Reports,
Player Updates for breaking player news as it happens. Be
sure to monitor our News, NFL News page for gameday fantasy
tips, and throughout the week as our staff is committed to
providing the most complete fantasy and NFL news coverage
on the web.


THE TOP SCORERS, BY POSITION

Along with the leaders in any statistical category, you can
also find the leaders at each position. Go to Statistics,
Player Scoring to see how many fantasy points your players
have scored each week. Use the second listbox above the
report to view week-by-week fantasy scores for all players
at a specific position. It's yet another great way to scout
players for that key late-season trade or free agent
pickup.

HELLO AGAIN E-RIDERS!


Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact, Telluri=
de=20
has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the temperatur=
es=20
have been frigid=01(which makes for excellent snowmaking conditions. Winter=
 has=20
come, and you know what that means =01( YES! Time to strap on some boards a=
nd=20
make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=
he=20
local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=
he=20
window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20
waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=
=20
other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20
anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=
=20
check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT=
=20
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And=
=20
that=01,s what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.=
=20
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some o=
f=20

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging=
=20
deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT=01,S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=
rt=20
installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=
ft=20
pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=
,=20
5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from=20
beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be =01&tasty.=018

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=
=20
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20
Sophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=
=20
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenin=
gs=20
year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner=20
reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=
ore.=20
You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American=20
Airlines=01*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body i=
s in=20
one of them!


WHAT=01,S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22=
,=20
the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=
=20
the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=
=20
ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=
rd=20
Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21=20
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program. Wh=
at=01,
s it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at participati=
ng=20
lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lif=
t=20
ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for=
=20
each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360.

And if you=01,re looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at t=
he=20
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboar=
d=20
Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center.=20
Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was th=
e=20
case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=
=20
fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to=
=20
dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter=01,s absolute embarrassment!) How=
ever,=20
the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever=
.=20
The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no=

AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That=01,s all for this letter. Hope you=01,re planning your trip to Telluri=

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

quarterback Brian Griese, the AFC's top-rated passer, might be lost for the
regular season with a severely separated throwing shoulder.

''He'll be out a minimum of three weeks,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said
Tuesday.

The news stunned the Broncos, who watched Monday night as Griese shook off
the injury and led his team back into the AFC West race by knocking off
first-place Oakland 27-24.

Griese, already playing with cartilage damage in his right shoulder,
suffered a third-degree separation while being chased out of bounds in the
first quarter. Griese, whose first shoulder injury this season also was vs.
the Raiders, returned after taking a pain-killing injection.

''When they told me that I might be out three, four, five weeks, I said, 'If
that's the case, put me back in there so I can play one more time,' '' he
said.



In the "Here we go again" department, RB Terrell Davis was noticeably
limping after Monday Night's game.  From the same USA Today article : "Also
in question are the status of Terrell Davis, who was limping noticeably
after the game, and guard Mark Schlereth, who could be headed for yet
another knee surgery in what likely is his final season. Davis, in fact,
revealed that his left foot had been bothering him the past 2-3 weeks. "

I had also heard reports he was bothered by a calf problem.  Not sure
whether it's the foot or the calf (or both) and it's not clear yet whether
the injury is serious enough to be a factor this weekend.  I'll keep you
posted and just wanted to give you the headsup.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  "We'll see Wednesday or Thursday," said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, "but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play."    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.

FIVE-DAY SUPER SALE: $158 RT COAST-TO-COAST
On Tuesday of this week, our coast-to coast airfares for $158 roundtrip
expired. Due to overwhelming demand, we have been able to convince our

contract was signed and sealed at 11:00 a.m., this morning.

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 
draft today @ 10:30 AM. Tell me if this is ok.  If you do not remember the 
rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

I never heard anything back from Walker's Westies so The Rounders are taking 
his spot.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Pickens was unable to play the full game Sunday against Pittsburgh after 
re-injuring his hamstring. He didn't have a catch for the second straight 
week, the first time in his career he has done that. If Pickens can't play 
Sunday, the ailing Titans will probably struggle against the tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sanders, who was forced to leave Sunday's game against Pittsburgh with 
strained rib cartilage, may be limited in practice this week, but will likely 
play next Sunday against Baltimore. He had four catches for 70 yards in the 
game, and should continue to serve as one of the Titans' top two receivers 
(with Derrick Mason) as long as Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen are ailing. 
If Tennessee is forced to turn to another option, the only players left are 
inexperienced Chris Jackson and Chris Coleman.  

 Tony Martin , WR MIA - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Martin is expected to return to action this week against the Chargers.  He 
has been recovering from a stress fracture in his right foot that has kept 
him out of six games this season.    

 Al Del Greco , K TEN - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Del Greco missed a 24-yard field goal last Sunday against Pittsburgh, 
breaking a string of 46 straight from within 30 yards dating back to 1994. 
Still, he atoned for the miss by kicking the game-winner, a 30-yarder to 
close out the game, and added two other field goals. No reason to downgrade 
his value at this point.  

 Dolphins , DT MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/07/00 
 The Dolphins' defense put up another stellar effort on Sunday, holding the 
Lions to only eight points while playing at one of the NFL's toughest 
stadiums, the Silverdome. The Fish recorded two sacks, an interception, and 
recovered two fumbles in the game, while holding the Lions to only 268 yards 
of total offense. In injury news, linebacker Zach Thomas will miss this 
Sunday's game against the Chargers and may not be ready to play until after 
Miami's November 19th date with the Jets.  He is still recovering from a 
severely sprained ankle.  On a better note for Miami, defensive tackle Tim 
Bowens is expected to return to practice this week and will likely play 
against San Diego.        

 Steelers , DT PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 The Steelers' defense held Tennessee to nine points Sunday, and extended its 
streak of not allowing a touchdown to 20 quarters. Despite a mistake late in 
the fourth quarter that allowed the Titans to win the game, the Steelers gave 
Fantasy owners another solid performance. Pittsburgh sacked Steve McNair once 
and intercepted him another time in the game. Expect another solid outing 
next Sunday, when Philadelphia comes to town.  

 Colts , DT IND - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 It looks like defensive end Ellis Johnson will miss his second consecutive 
game this week when the Colts host the Jets on Sunday night.  "I don't know 
about Ellis," said Head Coach Jim Mora, "I kind of have my doubts."  Johnson 
is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.        

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 11/07/00 
 Harrison took a wicked hit to the back at the end of Sunday's game in 
Chicago, and complained of a stiff upper neck on Monday.  The injury isn't 
considered serious, and Harrison is expected to play this week against the 
Jets.  Against the Bears, Harrison caught six passes for 42 yards but was 
held out of the end zone for the first time in three weeks.  It was also the 
first time in five games that Harrison has been held under 100 yards 
receiving.    

 Kent Graham , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Although he won't start Sunday against Philadelphia, Graham is likely to get 
another shot at the job if Kordell Stewart doesn't improve. Graham averaged 
208 passing yards in his first three games, while Stewart is averaging 128 
yards in his four starts. Neither will take your Fantasy team to a league 
title.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Coach Bill Cowher named Stewart his starter for Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, despite a disappointing 112-yard passing game last Sunday. If 
Pittsburgh can't get it's air game going, expect Kent Graham to be 
re-installed as the starter over the upcoming weeks.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Edwards didn't record a single reception Sunday against Tennessee, and in 
fact, dropped a key pass during the game. With his recent struggles, it's 
likely Hines Ward and Bobby Shaw will get the majority of the passes the rest 
of the way.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/07/00 
 The Bills' defense held the Patriots to only 13 points on a cold and rainy 
day at Foxboro.  They sacked New England quarterbacks three times and 
recorded two interceptions as well, while keeping the Bills in the game with 
some tough goal-line stances.  On the injury front, defensive end Phil Hansen 
has been able to walk without crutches, but his sprained knee is expected to 
keep him out of action for another three to five weeks.     

 Cory Geason , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Geason will be sidelined for at least the next few games with a sprained 
left knee ligament. The Steelers, who have few other blocking tight ends on 
the roster, may need to sign one.  

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Morris suffered a thigh bruise during Sunday's game against the Patriots.  
Despite the injury, he is expected to practice with the team on Wednesday. 
The rookie running back complied 86 yards of total offense in Buffalo's 16-13 
overtime victory.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Bettis had just 42 rushing yards on 13 carries against one of the stingiest 
run defenses in the league, Tennessee, on Sunday. It was his lowest total 
since he had just eight yards in Week One against Baltimore. As a side note, 
Pittsburgh could be without center Dermontti Dawson for the rest of the 
season, and certainly will for at least the next few games due to a hamstring 
injury. Keep in mind that Bettis posted the lowest rushing yards total of his 
career (1,091) with Dawson missing nine games last season. We're not 
condemning Bettis, as he's still having a great season, but it's probably 
worth considering benching him against tougher defenses the rest of the way.  

 Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the Rams 
on November 20th. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, 
while Barber has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee.      

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Johnson will miss Washington's next game, a November 20th contest in St. 
Louis on Monday night.  He is not expected to return the Redskins' starting 
lineup until November 26th against the Eagles.  Head Coach Norv Turner, in an 
attempt to avoid a quarterback controversy, has already stated that Johnson 
will be the starter when he is healthy enough to play.     

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/07/00 
 George completed 20-of-39 passes for 276 yards but threw  two interceptions 
in Sunday's loss to the Cardinals.  He will likely start Washington's next 
game on November 20th against the Rams while starter Brad Johnson recovers 
from a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Cowboys' Head Coach Dave Campo said that he probably won't know until 
Wednesday if Aikman will be ready to go this Sunday against the Bengals.  The 
Cowboys' quarterback was scheduled to have a series of injections on Monday 
to relieve the inflammation in his lower back.  "As tough as he is," said 
Campo, "I wouldn't put it past him to be ready to go."    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The Cards' defense put up a heroic effort on Sunday, holding the Redskins' 
offense to just 15 points in their big NFC East win.  In the game, cornerback 
Aeneas Williams returned a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown, tying the NFL 
record for the longest fumble returned for a score.  On the downside, Arizona 
placed defensive tackle Tony McCoy on the injured list, losing him for the 
remainder of the season. He had missed three games after having arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee.  He will be replaced by Barron Tanner, whom the 
team signed as a free agent.    

 Pete Stoyanovich , K STL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/06/00 
 The Rams released kicker Pete Stoyanovich on Monday, a day after he missed 
two field-goal attempts in a loss to Carolina.  He missed badly from 37 and 
50 yards in the second quarter in Sunday night's 27-24 defeat at home.   The 
Rams are now looking to sign Jeff Hall who will take over as kicker until 
Jeff Wilkins recovers from his injured quadriceps.      

 Kris Heppner , K WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 The Redksins cut rookie Kris Heppner Monday.  Heppner was released by the 
Seahawks earlier this season.  The Redskins have a bye this week and will try 
out a number of prospects.  Among the many kickers they are considering 
hiring is 44-year old veteran Eddie Murray.    

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Freddie Jones had another solid receiving week. He caught 5 passes for 86 
yards. Too bad he plays for a team with QB problems!  

 Justin Watson , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 Watson started in place of Marshall Faulk but didn't do tow well.  He gained 
just 12 yards on 12 carries but did manage to score on a short touchdown run. 
 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/06/00 
 Green was a Fantasy star once again this week, but in a losing effort.  He 
passed for a career-high 431 yards, completed 29-of-42 passes with two 
touchdowns and no interceptions.   

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Leading the Panthers to the upset win, Beuerlein  completed 15-of-25 passes 
for 214 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.  Overall Beuerlein 
hasn't been as successful as he was last season but he is still just as 
effective.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/06/00 
 Robinson was a reliable Fantasy player once again on Sunday.  He had nine 
catches for 109 yards and scored a touchdown against the Colts.    

 Jim Miller , QB CHI - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Miller led the Bears to victory while starting for the injured Cade McNown 
Sunday.  He completed 24-of-35 passes for 214 yards and a touchdown.   

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 The NFL's leader in touchdown receptions didn't catch one on Sunday but he 
was still productive.  He caught six  passes for 97 yards.  Owens still leads 
the NFL with 11 TD receptions.     

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Blake may have been the surprise star of Week 10, throwing three touchdown 
passes.  The Saints have generally relied on RB Ricky Williams to move the 
offense this season but they turned to Blake on Sunday and he did not 
disappoint.  Blake completed 20-of-26 passes for 275 yards.

All the systems should be operational as usual.

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of
Hemphill, TX.  He is rated by Rivals as the #1 lineman prospect in the
country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

schroeder was drafted in the 10th

that is an 8 and a 10 for 8

Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he 
gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, 
so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a 
place in Dallas that we can crash at if we don't want to pay for a hotel.

Do you want to go?

-Eric

Two boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is
attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board
off of a nearby fence, wedges it down
the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving
his friend's life.

A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over
to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL"
he starts writing in his notebook.

"But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies.
"Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed
you were."

The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND
FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."

The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."

"Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an
Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."

The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."

The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."

"Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you
root for?" the reporter asked.

"Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.

The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS
KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."

Can you help me out here?  I don't have the details in the attached E-mail.  
So I need to understand what the product is so that we can determine the 
"back office" issues.  Apparently, time frame is short.  So I appreciate the 
info ASAP.  Thanks.

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

page at http://www.bestfares.com. Also, remember to visit our Newsdesk
daily at http://www.bestfares.com/travel_center/desks/newsdesk.asp

**************************** November 7, 2000  ************************

FLY TO FLORIDA THIS HOLIDAY SEASON FROM $128 RT.
Just in time to gear up for holiday travel, we have new low fares to
Florida valid for flights beginning December 20 through January 9, 2001.
If you didn=01,t buy the cheap Florida fares we offered in August and
September, then you may now be experiencing the airfare ticket shock we
warned you about back then. The major airlines are now claiming to offer
discount fares through February 4, but their cheapest seats for travel
between December 20 through January 9, 2001 are already gone. The good
news is that we still have seats available to the sunny state of Florida
for as low as $128 roundtrip. Even though the published fares have no
cheap seats remaining, we have a way to get you there for less if you act
quickly. For instance, Dayton (OH) to Florida through Bestfares.com is
only $128 roundtrip. Most of our special fares are between $180 and $258
roundtrip.  For a sample of our inexpensive =01&Frugal Fares to Get You To
Florida,=018 visit:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10105768

HAWAII ON SALE FOR THE HOLIDAYS THROUGH FEBRUARY 15, 2001.
Yes, we have an assortment of excellent Hawaiian fares, but we want to be
upfront about availability. Certain cheap seats to Honolulu will be tight
between December 20 and 29, 2000, so act fast because we are currently
finding cheap fares to Kona and, on select holiday dates, to Maui. For
example, you can head to Maui or Kona from $395 roundtrip. Or how about
San Diego, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland (OR), Los Angeles or San Francisco
to Honolulu for an even lower $345 roundtrip? Fly from Dallas/Fort Worth,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis or Houston to Hawaii for $428 roundtrip.
>From New York City, Boston, Washington (DC), Orlando or Miami, it=01,s $502
roundtrip. Check out our special fares to Hawaii. Travel is valid through
February 15, 2001. Be flexible and you can save a bundle. Click to:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10085830

FLY TO THE CARIBBEAN FROM $180 RT THROUGH MARCH 14, 2001.
We have some excellent cruise prices out of San Juan, Puerto Rico at the
moment. Combine this with our inexpensive airfare to San Juan as low as
$180 roundtrip through March 14, 2001, and you now have a double whammy
for a super Caribbean getaway! We have a great variety for you. For
instance, roundtrip airfare from New York City is $180, from Fort
Lauderdale $200, Orlando $246, Boston $252 and Chicago $286. Fly from
Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle or Las Vegas to San
Juan for $414 roundtrip. These airfares can be up to 50 percent off.
Travel between December 18 and January 8, 2001 is sold out. For further
information, visit:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489

SENIORS AND COMPANIONS COAST-TO-COAST FOR $248 RT OR LESS.
This week, some of the best deals in America are for seniors age 62 and
over. One of the greatest things about senior discounts is that they allow
a companion of any age to travel along at the same low price. Plus, the
good news keeps getting better when you discover there are only 10
blackout dates on these amazing airfares: November 21, 25, 26 & 27 and
December 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 & 27. That=01,s it! If you can fly around those
dates, there is a good chance you could save a bundle. Here are some
examples. Fly from San Diego, Orange County, Ontario (CA), San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland (OR) or Las Vegas to Boston, New York City, Washington
(DC), Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale or more for only $238 roundtrip.
Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans, Little Rock, Oklahoma
City or Tulsa to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or
Norfolk is just $142 roundtrip. Take a look at our =01&Seniors Fly for Less
Across the USA=018 specials. This is a great time to buy the parents or
grandparents a great holiday gift of airfare. Click to:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10019294

HOLIDAY FARES TO CANADA FROM $60 RT THROUGH JANUARY 7, 2001.
If you want to fly to Canada during Thanksgiving or the late December
holidays, we have airfares as low as $60 to the Great White North. Now
that=01,s something to shout about. From Seattle to Vancouver, you can fly
for $60 roundtrip. From Portland (OR), it=01,s $93 roundtrip. San Francisco
to Vancouver is $112 roundtrip. Cleveland, Detroit or Pittsburgh to
Toronto is only $85 roundtrip. Hartford to Montreal is also $85 roundtrip.
>From Boston or Providence, it=01,s $100 roundtrip. Newark to Montreal is $9=
1
roundtrip. If you want an inexpensive holiday excursion, then consider
Canada for a great getaway. The American dollar is quite strong now, room
rates are low, and of course, we have super cheap Canadian airfares from
over 40 US cities. To take advantage of the savings, visit:
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10044703

EUROFARE IS BACK! HOPSCOTCH EUROPE FOR ONLY $89 PER FLIGHT
If you want to see city after city in Europe on a cheap buck there is only
one word to say and it=01,s =01&Eurofare.=018  Imagine flying from Paris to=
 Rome
for $89 or how about London to Amsterdam for that same incredibly low
rate?  All you have to do is purchase a round-trip transatlantic ticket on
Lufthansa or United Airlines from the USA to Europe and then you can
travel to more than 100 cities in 35 countries within Europe for only $89
per flight.  That=01,s right, Lufthansa Airlines=01, Eurofare is back and i=
t=01,s
taking you on a ride to your favorite European cities for only $89 per
flight!

One-way fares from Frankfurt to Rome are as high as $871 and Munich to
Paris currently sells for $345 on a major European Airline. At $89 per
flight for the same cities Eurofare is a great bargain! To qualify book a
roundtrip airline ticket on Lufthansa or United Airlines now through March
30, 2001 and you can add up to six additional flights within Europe for
only $89 per flight.  Your originating transatlantic flight must depart by
March 31, 2001 and your roundtrip travel must be completed by April 7,
2001.

Some restrictions and blackouts apply so you may want to read our full
story by visiting: http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10105980 or visit

I think Webb and I will need to schedule a game (which will be difficult).    
After that, it looks like we would play the aggies this weekend or next.

It is uncertain if AC will be party these games.

This is to those of you who can make the game tonight.  Please try to get to 
the game as early as possible (6:15-6:30) so we can practice a little.

We should have eight pending Luis' friend.

Let me know if anything comes up between now and game time that we prevent 
your attendance.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports?=20
 Latest NBA Player News=20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Marshall is suffering from a knee injury and is questionable for Tuesday's=
=20
game against the Raptors.  David Benoit will get extended playing time if=
=20
Marshall is unable to play.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Baker sat out Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a knee injury. =20
Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis got extended playing time in his absence. =
=20
Look for that to continue until Baker returns.  For now he is listed as=20
questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.   =20

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Sabonis missed Sunday's game at Phoenix due to a sore knee.  He has now=20
missed three games in a row and is questionable for Wednesday's game at=20
Toronto.  When Sabonis finally returns look for him to come off the bench f=
or=20
a few games before returning to his job as the starting center.  Dale Davis=
=20
will start at the pivot until then.  =20

 Hubert Davis , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Davis missed his third straight game Sunday due to a strained groin. =20
Courtney Alexander replaced him at shooting guard.  Davis is questionable f=
or=20
Tuesday's game at Houston.  When he finally does return to the lineup he ma=
y=20
find that Greg Buckner or Michael Finley has replaced him at the two-spot. =
  =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Nash sat out Sunday's game against the Lakers because of a bruised calf. =
=20
The Mavericks went with a backcourt of Howard Eisley and rookie Courtney=20
Alexander in his absence.  Nash is questionable for Tuesday's game at=20
Houston.   =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Buckner played for the Mavericks Sunday after missing seven straight games=
=20
prior to that with a sprained foot.   It will take him a while but Buckner=
=20
will become a productive Fantasy player again in a few weeks, if he is stil=
l=20
healthy.     =20

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Mullin is still suffering from a sore knee and missed his fifth consecutiv=
e=20
game Sunday.  If you have Mullin on your team hoping for a miracle Fantasy=
=20
season, it's time to let go.  It appears that Mullin won't be well enough t=
o=20
help a Fantasy team this season.    =20

 Chris Porter , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 With Chris Mullin and Chris Mills sidelined, Porter got the first start of=
=20
his career Sunday, playing small forward.  He responded by scoring 18 point=
s=20
and grabbing six rebounds.  Look out for Porter.  He is extremely athletic=
=20
and could develop into a surprise Fantasy star in the upcoming weeks.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Carter is listed as day-to-day with a sore left knee, but will accompany t=
he=20
team on its three-game road trip. Head Coach Lenny Wilkens said that Carter=
's=20
availability for the trip won't be determined until Tuesday. It may be a go=
od=20
idea to sit Carter this week until his return date is a bit more clear.    =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to practice with t=
he=20
team on Monday and may be available to play against the Celtics on Tuesday=
=20
night.  If Hill's injured ankle is still tender, however, he will likely wa=
it=20
until Orlando's West Coast road trip next week before returning. Fantasy=20
owners who have been waiting for Hill's return should keep him on the bench=
=20
until he has been cleared to play by the team.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Gill, who is currently stuck in a horrendous shooting slump, may find=20
himself either on the bench or being placed on the injured list. Gill has=
=20
been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, which has made him feel like=
=20
he is "playing on one leg."  Fantasy owners who were expecting Gill to be=
=20
productive should seriously consider benching him until he is healthy enoug=
h=20
to perform at a higher level. =20

 Fred Hoiberg , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Hoiberg is less optimistic that he will be able to play against the=20
Timberwolves on Tuesday after testing his sore left ankle in a workout on=
=20
Saturday.  He is listed as day to day, and hopes to return for Chicago's=20
weekend road trip through Texas. Hoiberg, like many of his Chicago teammate=
s,=20
holds very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Brand missed practice on Sunday after sustaining a left knee hyperextensio=
n=20
at the end of Friday night's loss to the Knicks. He will have an MRI=20
performed on Monday and is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game agains=
t=20
Minnesota. Brand leads the Bulls in scoring (18.8 ppg) and rebounding (10.4=
=20
rpg), and is one of the top forwards in the world of Fantasy.  Owners may=
=20
want to put Brand on their bench this week until the extent of his injury h=
as=20
been determined.  =20

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Herren has been placed on the injured list because of his sore shoulder, b=
ut=20
remains optimistic that he can return soon. "I'm going to rest it a bit and=
=20
see how it goes," said Herren. If the injury persists, surgery may be his=
=20
next option. Herren isn't a very value Fantasy player, so his injury won't=
=20
effect most owners.   =20

 Mitch Richmond , G WAS - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Richmond injured his right knee in Saturday's game against Miami, and didn=
't=20
make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game with the Pistons. He will have a=
n=20
MRI done on Monday to determine the extent of the injury.  If you have=20
Richmond on your Fantasy roster, it may be a good idea to keep him on the=
=20
bench this week. =20

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Washington Wizards, who traded Ekezie to the Clippers last week, have=
=20
picked him up off of waivers. Ekezie, who was released by the Clippers=20
shortly after the trade, had averaged 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in his=20
first stint with Washington.  He holds no Fantasy value.  =20

 Glenn Robinson , F MIL - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Robinson, one of three starters who began the game on the bench for missin=
g=20
a pregame meeting, scored 24 points as Milwaukee beat the Indiana Pacers=20
92-80 Sunday. Bucks coach George Karl kept Robinson, fellow forward Jason=
=20
Caffey and point guard Sam Cassell out of the starting lineup one day after=
=20
criticizing his team for its dismal play in a loss at Atlanta.   Cassell,=
=20
Robinson and Caffey were replaced by Lindsey Hunter, Tim Thomas and Jerome=
=20
Kersey, respectively.   When Robinson entered the game after watching the=
=20
first eight minutes, he missed his first five shots before finding his=20
touch.   =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/03/00=20
 Oakley was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 by the=
=20
NBA on Friday for punching Los Angeles Clippers guard Jeff McInnis during t=
he=20
morning shootaround.   He sat out Friday night's game against the Clippers,=
=20
and also will miss games in Utah on Tuesday and Portland on Wednesday.    =
=20

 Scott Williams , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Milwaukee Bucks activated Williams from the injured list. Williams wen=
t=20
on the injured list November 17 with lower back spasms. He had been startin=
g=20
at center until his injury but came off the bench Saturday, grabbing four=
=20
rebounds in six scoreless minutes of a 101-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. To=
=20
make room for Williams, the Bucks placed rookie guard Michael Redd on the=
=20
injured list.  =20

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Chicago Bulls activated Voskuhl on Friday and placed rookie guard A.J.=
=20
Guyton on the injured list with a sprained right knee.   =20

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Minnesota Timberwolves activated Hammonds from the injured list.  =20
Hammonds had been sidelined for the entire season with soreness in both=20
ankles. To make room for Hammonds, the Timberwolves placed forward Reggie=
=20
Slater on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee.   =20

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 MacCulloch was activated Friday by the Philadelphia 76ers and Pepe Sanchez=
=20
was placed on the injured list with bursitis in the left hip.   MacCulloch=
=20
was placed on the injured list Nov. 20 with tendinitis in his left ankle.  =
 =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Cleveland Cavaliers activated Knight from the injured list Friday. The=
=20
point guard had knee surgery Aug. 17. Cleveland also placed guard Michael=
=20
Hawkins on the injured list because of a sprained left ankle.  =20

 Bonzi Wells , G POR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Wells was suspended for Thursday night's game against Dallas and fined=20
$10,000 by the NBA for intentionally striking and verbally abusing an=20
official.   He will be back in the lineup for Saturday's game at Houston.  =
 =20

 A.J. Guyton , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Guyton sprained his right knee during the first quarter of Thursday night'=
s=20
game against Chicago. He will undergo an MRI on Friday, and will likely mis=
s=20
a few games due to the injury. Guyton is of no value in the world of Fantas=
y.=20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Interim head coach Nate McMillan has inserted Davis into the starting line=
up=20
at guard in place of Ruben Patterson.  This move was made more to improve t=
he=20
ballhandling and defense in the backcourt than for offense.  Davis will tak=
e=20
some of the pressure off Gary Payton in running the plays but he won't be o=
f=20
much help to Fantasy teams.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/01/00=20
 New coach Nate McMillan has made numerous roster changes since taking over=
=20
as interim head coach one of them has involved Baker.  McMillan has replace=
d=20
Baker in the starting lineup with F/C Jelani McCoy.  The move could help to=
=20
motivate Baker in the long run.  He seemed fired up against the Lakers=20
Thursday scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds.  But Baker must stil=
l=20
prove that he can be a consistent producer, put him on your bench until his=
=20
Fantasy production becomes more solid. =20

 Tyronn Lue , G LAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 The Lakers are considering offers for Lue.  He is currently on injured=20
reserve but the Sixers and the Magic have shown interest in him.  Lue could=
=20
develop into a somewhat valuable Fantasy player on either team where he wou=
ld=20
receive extended minutes as a backup.   =20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 With Tyrone Nesby traded to Washington.  Richardson moved into the startin=
g=20
lineup at shooting guard Wednesday.  He scored 18 points and grabbed eight=
=20
rebounds.  Keep an eye on Richardson.  If he continues to perform like this=
=20
he will be a nice Fantasy acquisition.  =20

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 Walker has been placed on the injured list due to a sprained left ankle. T=
he=20
ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.=
=20
Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is=

only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.   =20

=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit)? Time to give props where props are  due.? Kordel=
l=20
looks like a new  man.? Actually, he looks like the  old Kordell.? The GOOD=
=20
old Kordell.  Over the last three weeks, he ranks as the # 5 QB in my=20
Performance / TD system  based on FF points per game.? Gotta  hand it to Bi=
ll=20
Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting? WRs like that but Hines=
=20
Ward has  delivered.? It=01,s probably not the  best thing for Jerome Betti=
s=20
owners but Stewart=01,s 3 rushing TDs over the last 3  weeks are huge.?

QB Aaron  Brooks (NO)? Brooks made my upgrade list last week  and I put my=
=20
money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league  to pick=
=20
him up? last week as a free  agent.? I said last week that we=01,d  see how=
 he=20
does with the pressure on all week.? Obviously, this is one cool kid.? If y=
ou=20
saw the footage of him in the  tunnel before the game he looked like he was=
=20
ready to go out and play a game of  flag football or something.? He made =
=20
some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times.? The obvious=20
comparison is a young  Randall Cunningham.? He=01,s skinny and  has a littl=
e bit=20
of those Cunningham crazy legs.? Plus he=01,s got a big arm with that whipp=
y =20
motion.? But the biggest thing that  impresses me about Brooks is his poise=
.?=20
 Grab him if he=01,s available in your league.?

I asked my  friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks.?=
=20
Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun  King before the draft. Here=01,s wha=
t the=20
1999 TFY Draft Preview had for  Brooks:? =20

AARON BROOKS  Virginia 6'3" 210 4.71

Fifth year senior who completed 54% of his passes  throwing for 2,319 yards=
,=20
12 touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the  ball 83 times for 23=
2=20
yards, averaging 2.8 yards per carry with five more  scores.? Led the ACC i=
n=20
passing efficiency two seasons ago, throwing for  57% / 2,282 / 20 / 7.? Go=
od=20
athlete who has shown great improvement in his  quarterback skills the last=
=20
season and a half.? Smooth and fluid, sets his  feet in the pocket, shows=
=20
good strength and stands his ground when being  rushed.? Has a live arm; ca=
n=20
thread a needle, throws ropes and his deep  passes have speed.? Effective=
=20
throwing on the run, squares his shoulders  and quickly releases the ball.=
=20
Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers, pulls the  ball down, running betwee=
n=20
the tackles.? While he has improved his accuracy  and places his passes wel=
l,=20
he often overthrows receivers.? The further  down the field or out to the=
=20
flanks he must get the ball, the more his accuracy  struggles.? Must do a=
=20
better job reading and recognizing defenses, stop  staring down his primary=
=20
target and not hold the ball so long while in the  pocket.? A player who=20
turned himself into a good prospect with a solid  senior campaign.? Mid to=
=20
late Sixth Round.?

Thanks  Tony.? Be sure to check out Tony=01,s  great info at=20
www.TFYDraftPreview.com?

QB Kurt  Warner? (StL)?? Warner=01,s chomping at the bit and has been named=
 the =20
starter this week relieving Trent Green.?  Keep an eye out on how he looks =
in=20
practice.? Coach Mike Martz said last week he was  concerned about Warner=
=01,s=20
grip strength and ability to put rotation on the  ball.? I=01,m thinking he=
=01,ll=20
be good to  go.?

QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? What  else can you say about this guy??  Take awa=
y=20
his running game??  No problem.? Give him WRs  that would? struggle to make=
=20
a  division I team? ?No problem.? He finds a way to get it done.? He looks =
to=20
me like he=01,s beginning to  reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at=20
Syracuse where he was  unstoppable.? It=01,s especially  impressive as team=
s=20
know what he=01,s going and still can=01,t stop him.? It should be noted th=
at=20
LaVarr Arrington  was injured early and he was the designated =01&spy=018 b=
ut=20
still, it was an  impressive performance against a very good Washington=20
defense.? I see little reason why he won=01,t  continue although he really =
needs=20
help at WR.?

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer  might pla=
y=20
the late season 1999 Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives  anothe=
r=20
struggling? QB=01,s  career.? Dilfer seems very  comfortable with what Bill=
ick=20
is asking him to do and brings a little fire and  attitude to the offense=
=20
that had been missing.? I like what they=01,re doing and don=01,t see  why =
it won=01,t=20
continue.? Although  don=01,t forget they=01,re off this week.



QB Brad  Johnson (Was)? Jeff George yields to the young man from  Florida=
=20
State.? His knee is  reportedly good to go and he=01,s been cleared by the=
=20
trainers as fit to  start.? Considering the troubles the  team endured with=
=20
George at the helm, Johnson has already been named the  starter.? He=01,ll =
be=20
working with a  nicked WR corps so we=01,ll see how he fares.?

QB Ryan Leaf  (SD)? Kordell Stewart, Trent Dilfer and Ryan  Leaf?? You gott=
a=20
be kidding me.? But after another solid outing, you  can=01,t deny Leaf is=
=20
making plays.?  Granted, he still throws the ugly interception(s) and he ge=
ts=20
hurt almost  as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for=
=20
you if you need a  spot QB.? He=01,s got one of the top 3  TEs in the game =
with=20
Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are  veterans who can make =
a=20
difference.?  This win will have to buoy the spirits and  enthusiasm.

??

RBs Moving Up?

RB Mike  Anderson (Den)? Once is a coincidence.? Twice is a trend. You=01,v=
e got=20
to start  handing credit to Mike Shanahan, Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia=
k,=20
and that  offensive line. Like everyone else, I marveled at the way Olandis=
=20
Gary was able  to run last year when Terrell Davis went down.? What a great=
=20
job of scouting we all  thought.? But hey, Gary was a pretty  highly touted=
=20
back.? But Mike  Anderson???? Anderson=01,s a  fine back but I=01,ve got to=
 believe=20
it=01,s a team deal here.? The good news is that Anderson=01,s team  isn=01=
,t going=20
anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell  Davis=
=20
recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment.? Watch this during the week, b=
ut=20
it  wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game. ?And as l=
ong=20
as Anderson rolls up 195  rushing yards a game like he did Sunday, you won=
=01,t=20
see Shanahan crying over TD  being out.? Granted 80 of those  yards came on=
=20
one big run but he had a great game any way you slice  it.?

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? I=01,ve been eating crow (Raven?) for a  while now a=
s I=20
was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at  this level=
=20
after a very disappointing 1999 season at Tennessee.? Lewis is running like=
=20
he did as a  Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have=
=20
the best blend of  speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George.=
?=20
Coach Brian Billick has the Raven  offense firing on all cylinders and Lewi=
s=20
remains a huge part of it.? His only down side is that he=01,s off this  we=
ek=20
with a bye.? But that week 16  matchup against Arizona is looking very=20
tasty=01(?

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? Considering what he does with that  surrounding cas=
t,=20
I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back  in the NFL.?=
=20
There have been few  passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the=20
Bengals, yet Dillon  continues to pound out the yards when defenses know=20
exactly what=01,s coming at  them.? It=01,s amazing to watch.? I don=01,t k=
now how=20
long he can keep it up  but he=01,s got the woeful Cardinals this week and =
you=20
have to like  that.?

RB Warrick  Dunn (TB)? Dunn made the upgrade list last week in  the wake of=
=20
Mike Alstott=01,s knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his  owners=
=20
Sunday with 129 total yards including 2 TDs.? There was some talk about him=
=20
sharing  carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the=
=20
ball for Tampa  Bay.? Look for more of the same from  the Bucs and new=20
offensive coordinator Warren Sapp=01(? Seriously, Dunn showed he could hand=
le =20
20 rushing attempts and I think you=01,ll continue to see them go with what=
=01,s =20
working.? =20



RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman may be the lone bright spot on  the=20
Arizona team.? I told you last  week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and=
=20
you saw the results last night as  Pittman rambled for 77 yards on only 13=
=20
carries (5.7 ypc)? Like Corey Dillon, the surrounding team  kills his value=
=20
but if he ran for a team that held a lead, he=01,d be awesome.? Unfortunate=
ly, I=20
don=01,t see Arizona  turning into such a team anytime soon so don=01,t get=
 too=20
excited.? But overall, I like the guy a  lot.?

RB Richie  Anderson (NYJ)? Each year, there are always unheralded  guys who=
=20
post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners.? Many tim=
es=20
they are RBs who quietly post  yardage (and FF points) receiving the ball.?=
=20
Anderson is a prime example of one such  player this year (as?are Tony=20
Richardson and Stanley Pritchett)? He=01,s caught 15 passes over the last 3=
 =20
games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus, that trend wil=
l =20
likely continue.???

RB Robert  Holcombe (StL)? It doesn=01,t take a rocket scientist to  see th=
at=20
Marshall Faulk isn=01,t 100%.?  Red flags went up across the country when M=
ike=20
Martz elected to give  Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday.?  6 weeks=
=20
ago, that would have been Faulk=01,s carry all day long.? Holcombe looks to=
=20
benefit if Faulk=01,s  workload continues to be decreased.? =20



RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? Aside from having one of those cool  names the fans=
=20
can yell whenever he does something good, Hoover has shown to be  a capable=
=20
replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka.? He doesn=01,t have the=20
physical tools of a  Biakabutuka but you can=01,t deny he hasn=01,t been=20
effective.? It wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see  Hoover continue to see=
=20
action.

??

WRs Moving Up

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Harrison stated before Sunday=01,s game  that he=
=20
needed to =01&get on a mission=018.?  Looked like he started towards that e=
nd with=20
2 TD catches and he could  have had another.? Yes, you=01,d like  to see mo=
re=20
than 4 catches but I=01,ll take 2 TDs any week.? Harrison=01,s biggest worr=
y is=20
that Peyton  Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for=
=20
dropping easy  balls.? Harrison is fine and  actually looking better in my=
=20
eyes.?

WR Hines  Ward (Pit)? Does anyone else find it interesting to  see Kordell=
=20
Stewart throwing the ball to another =01&slash=018 type player in Hines  Wa=
rd??=20
Ward doesn=01,t have the name of  a Plaxico Burress but he=01,s certainly m=
ore=20
productive.? If I=01,m Burress, I=01,d be for finding a  baseball cap that =
I was=20
comfortable with=01(?

WR Amani  Toomer (NYG)? Toomer=01,s back in a big way.? He had us worried t=
here=20
for a stretch  earlier but he=01,s playing very well right now, especially =
with=20
Ike Hilliard  out.? QB Kerry Collins has settled  into a nice rhythm and=20
coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a  playoff slot.?=
=20
Look for?Toomer  and Collins to be a big part of making that happen.



WR Sean  Dawkins (Ind)? With his size (6=01, 4=018 / 218 #) I=01,ve  always=
 wondered=20
why he isn=01,t better.?  He=01,s showing over the last few games that mayb=
e he=20
is.? Over the last 3 games, he rates as the #  5 WR in Fantasy Points per=
=20
game.? It  doesn=01,t seem to make a great deal of difference to him whethe=
r it=01,
s Jon Kitna or  Brock Huard throwing the ball, he just delivers.???

WR Peter  Warrick (Cin)Garbage time or not,  he scored another TD this week=
=20
and he=01,s a great gamble if you need to roll the  dice for a home run.? Y=
es,=20
he=01,s as  liable to go 2 for 18 as he is score a TD but sometimes, those =
are=20
the kinds of  gambles that pay big.? The team  reportedly was forcing him t=
o=20
see an eye doctor for contact lenses.? This could be like Charlie Sheen in =
=20
Major League with the new glasses.?  Seriously, if he=01,s had bad vision t=
hat=01,s=20
been limiting him, look out once  he gets the contacts.?

WR Joe  Jurevicius (NYG)? With Ike Hilliard out, Jurevicius got  all he eve=
r=20
wanted =01) a chance.? And  he=01,s making the most of it.? He=01,s  clearl=
y the #2 WR=20
behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking, the #2 guy  has definite=
=20
value.? Keep an eye on  Hilliard=01,s return but he could be a nice sub if =
you=01,
re in a  pinch.?

WR Willie  Jackson (NO)? Jackson is looking less =01&fluky=018 with  each g=
ame.??=20
He put together a  nice day Sunday with 4 catches for 64 yards.? Like=20
Jurevicius, he=01,s the clear cut # 2  receiver but he=01,s certainly valua=
ble.? =20
QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to =20
benefit.?

WR R. Jay  Soward (Jac)? I=01,ll be honest, I really don=01,t like  Soward =
much but=20
you can=01,t dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be  forcing the=
 ball=20
to him on the long throws.? He=01,ll draw the weaker coverage (and  rightly=
 so)=20
when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could  have=
=20
some mismatches.? =20

??

TEs Moving Up?

TE Freddie  Jones (SD)? Jones is still under the radar of a few  owners as =
he=20
plays for the Chargers.?  Truth is,? he=01,s one of the  better receivers i=
n the=20
game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego.? He=01,s a nice big tar=
get=20
with soft hands  for new QB Ryan Leaf.? He=01,s had 11  receptions over the=
 last=20
3 games.?

TE Jay  Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma=01,s returning to the player we  knew he=
=20
could be.? With 5 receptions  for 82 yards Sunday, he=01,s a vital part of =
the=20
offense. ?With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy  McDaniel not doing much, it=
=01,s=20
pretty much Eric Moulds and  Reimersma.



TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained  knee, LaFlu=
er=20
seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with 6  catches f=
or=20
45 yards and a TD.? Keep  an eye on Harris but this could be a trend.

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? Becht earns the upgrade just for the  beautiful=20
diving TD catch Sunday.?  At this point in the season, rookies aren=01,t re=
ally=20
rookies any more as  most have enough experience that they=01,re learning t=
he=20
ropes.? Becht appears to be a fast learner and  could give this team a huge=
=20
boost with solid TE  play.

??

QBs Moving Down?

QB Jeff  George (Was)? Audition time is over.? Didn't you have the feeling=
=20
owner Danny  Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor=
e=20
Brad Johnson  sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year (i=
f=20
they ever do  that)? Instead, he looked very  average and even a little bit=
=20
old.?  Brad Johnson will get the start this week.? You never know with knee=
=20
injuries so  George certainly still has value, just nothing like he did as =
a =20
starter.



QB Trent  Green (StL)? Chris Berman made a great point last  night on ESPN=
=01,s=20
Prime Time.? Trent  Green is a nice player but let=01,s forget this talk ab=
out=20
him being the same  player as Kurt Warner.??  Another loss for the Rams=20
pretty much guaranteed we=01,ll see Warner this  week.? The Rams are sudden=
ly =20
fighting for their lives and it won=01,t be Green behind center.?

QB Shane  Matthews (Chi)? The University of Florida has a great  program an=
d=20
always places a large number of players at the next level but  Matthews loo=
ks=20
to be another shot putting QB that simply can=01,t deliver the ball  at thi=
s=20
level.? It=01,s a testament to  coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise sys=
tems=20
to make guys like Matthews and  Danny Wuerffel look great in college becaus=
e=20
they clearly lack the talent.? Put it this way, Matthews has Bears fan =20
wishing Cade McNown will get back soon=01(



QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Whether it=01,s the thumb or the WRs or the  play=20
calling, Bledsoe is struggling.?  I used to blame this on Bill Belichick=20
coming up with a Jets defense that  shattered Bledsoe=01,s confidence and t=
hrew=20
him into a tailspin this time of year  but now I=01,ll have to start lookin=
g for=20
other theories.?? As Terry Glenn said, =01& it felt  like the defense knew=
=20
exactly what we were going to do=018.? That=01,s bad for a Thursday  game.

??

RBs Moving Down?

RB Emmitt  Smith? (Dal)? As you  probably saw, Emmitt was knocked out for a=
=20
moment during the Thanksgiving Day  game.? Check his status this  week.? Ev=
en=20
100%, he faces a tough  stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa=
=20
Bay, Washington, New York  Giants, and Tennessee.?

RB J.J.  Johnson (Mia)? Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early  indicatio=
ns=20
are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means  Johnso=
n=20
takes a seat.?

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? It looks to me like the Falcons are very  close t=
o=20
packing it in.? He may be  worth one more start against the porous Seattle=
=20
defense this week but after  that, he=01,s got a bye and then New Orleans.?

RB Marshall  Faulk (StL)? Understand, he=01,s still a top RB, but I think h=
is =20
value is clearly falling a bit.? He  looks less than 100% but the most=20
telling indicator by far was the Robert  Holcombe goalline carry.? 6 weeks =
=20
ago, no way does Holcombe get that carry.?  He=01,s still a must start and=
=20
Warner will likely help his stock but I=01,m a  little worried.?

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ)? The weather conditions made it tough to  get a tru=
e=20
picture of Martin=01,s health but it was pretty easy to see he wasn=01,t  1=
00%=20
Sunday.? Between Bernie  Parmalee and Richie Anderson, coach Al Groh has=20
plenty of options and he doesn=01,t  hesitate to go with them.?

RB Jermaine  Fazande (SD) ?The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher  and look=
s=20
to have lost his starting job.?  Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counti=
ng=20
on him for too much  anyway.

??

WRs Moving Down?

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten)? Drop this guy if you haven=01,t  already.? He mis=
ses=20
games with a  myriad of injuries and when he does see the field, he manages=
=20
to drop key  passes=01(?

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? One has to wonder what could have been  with Jim=
=20
Miller healthy.? Shane  Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a=
=20
whopping one time Sunday.? That will not do.?=20



WR Sylvester  Morris (KC)? Morris has been especially disappointing  as one=
=20
usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be =
=20
going the other way.? Over the last  3 weeks, he ranks as the # 81 WR in my=
=20
TD / Performance system.? Part of that can be attributed to Elvis  Grbac /=
=20
Warren Moon but he=01,s not playing well right now.?

WR Terance  Mathis (Atl)? Mathis ranks # 72 among WRs over the  last 3 game=
s=20
in my TD / Performance system.? That=01,s not what you=01,re looking for fr=
om  a #=20
1 WR, even if it is the Falcons.???

Eagle  WRs? These guys are just not very good.? I had especially high hopes=
=20
for Charles  Johnson this year but he=01,s not getting it done.???

WR Wayne  Chrebet (NYJ)? As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson  whining abou=
t=20
Chrebet not being a #1 WR, it looks he may have had a point.? Chrebet just=
=20
doesn=01,t have the speed or  physical size to make a? consistent  impact w=
hen=20
defenses choose to take him out of the game.? I love the guy and admire his=
=20
grit and  determination but he struggles against double coverage.? And most=
 #=20
1 WR face double  coverage=01(?

?

TEs Moving Down



TE Andrew  Glover (NO)? A rising tide is supposed to lift all  boats but=20
nobody told Glover about that little axiom.? The Saints continue to roll in=
=20
spite of  a virtually non existent TE.? =20



TE Jackie  Harris (Dal)? Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a  knee Sunda=
y=20
and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes.?=20



TE Ricky  Dudley (Oak)? He=01,s maybe the most frustrating player  in the g=
ame.?=20
As soon as you bench  him, he=01,ll catch 2 TDs but I don=01,t know how man=
y more 1=20
reception days I can  take from this guy.? =20

I've adopted two children for the Enron Kids Program ..

Cortesia Taylor, Kindergarden
Jameka McCoy, PreK

The total cost for both children combined is guesstimated to be $350.  If all 
of us contribute, that will be only $15 per person.  I'll be taking 
collections this week and next if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Laura

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Rocks Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Klap Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.

We are going to have the draft on 8/20.  However, we still need to decide 
where and at what time.  I would prefer to have the draft around noon.  We 
can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the 
internet).  Please let me know ASAP.

September 6, 2000 WSJ

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a "gaffe" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a "major
league" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as "campaign-finance
reform." But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
"Christ," he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
"religious right." The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going "negative," primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's "negative"
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CNN's "Larry
King Live" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his "compassionate conservative" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it "negative."

You put your stylus in,
You put your stylus out,
You put your stylus in,
And you punch Buchanan out.
You do the Palm Beach Pokey
And you turn the count around,
That's what it's all about!

You put the Gore votes in,
You put the Bush votes out,
You put the Gore votes in,
And you do another count.
You do the Palm Beach Pokey
And you turn the count around,
That's what it's all about!

You bring your lawyers in,
You drag the whole thing out,
You bring your lawyers in,
And you put it all in doubt.
You do the Palm Beach Pokey
And you turn the count around,
That's what it's all about!

You let your doctors spin,
You let the pundits spout,
You let your retirees sue,
And your people whine and pout.
You do the Palm Beach Pokey
And you turn the count around,
That's what it's all about!

You do the Palm Beach Pokey,

Gore Calls For Recount Of Supreme Court Vote

WASHINGTON, DC-- An increasingly desperate Al Gore called for a recount 
Tuesday of the 
U.S. Supreme Court's 9-0 decision in Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing 
Board. "There 
is reason to suspect that these nine votes were not properly counted and that 
as many as five 
justices who sided with Mr. Bush did not intend to do so," Gore said. "It is 
therefore in the best 
interest of our democracy for the U.S. Supreme Court to suspend judgment in 
this case until we 
can be absolutely certain that this court did, in fact, intend to rule in Mr. 
Bush's favor." Gore added 
that if his recount request is denied, he will file an appeal with the 
Interplanetary Supreme Court.

Hi Folks,

Passing along an email from my friend Michael Germain. :   "It is being
reported in Dallas by 1310 The Ticket Radio, that Chris Warren
has been released by the Cowboys today. A press conference is scheduled for
this afternoon with Dave Campo. Just an FYI."

Thanks Michael and also thanks to our buddy Daniel Dunsworth for the info.
I doubt you had Warren starting on your playoff bound FF team but this says
a lot about their faith in Emmitt Smith.  Michael Wiley likely backs up
Smith now but for them to cut Warren loose with Smith just a few games
removed from a concussion is a pretty strong statement.  Smith proved once
again last week he's a gamer I'd think removing the threat of Warren
stealing a few carries has to slightly increase his value.

Have a nice evening.

Joe

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 KaRon Coleman , RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/04/00 
 Coleman has been ruled out of                    Sunday's game because of an 
ankle injury.  Mike Anderson will back up Terrell Davis and see most, if not 
all relief work that is available.  

 Robert Chancey , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Chancey has faded from view as a Fantasy player. The Chargers appear to be 
more comfortable with Terrell Fletcher and Jermaine Fazande as featured 
runners.  

 Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Conway might have a big day at Seattle. The Chargers will surely move him 
around and send him deep in an effort to keep the vulnerable Seahawks' 
secondary off balance.  
 Jeff Graham , WR SD - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Graham has been mostly quiet during the month of October. The Chargers seem 
to be more dependent on Freddie Jones and are waiting for Curtis Conway to 
develop some consistency.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Jones could approach 100 receiving yards at Seattle. The Seahawks do not 
have the bulk necessary at MLB or at the safeties to contain him.   

 Jermaine Fazande , RB SD - Murder Inc. Updated 11/03/00 
 Fazande might be a sleeper selection this week. He always gives Seattle's 
LBs problems with his strength and tenacity.   

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chargers have the personnel to defuse Seattle this week. The secondary 
will pounce on Jon Kitna's mistakes and the front seven will swarm all over 
Ricky Watters and Shaun Alexander.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 John Carney has made his last 10 field goal attempts against the Seahawks. 
Expect him to roll up more good numbers against them this week.  

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 The Seahawks have been crippled by an apparent choice to play zone 
coverages. Opponents simply avoid Shawn Springs and light up the other DBs. 
Jim Harbaugh is sure to follow the opposing blueprint for success this week.  
 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Lindell has shown some flashes of brilliance as Seattle's kicker, but the 
Seahawks' offense is hindering his productivity.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Dawkins has been showing some signs of life recently. The Seahawks need him 
to go over the middle more if they want to establish continuity on offense.  

 Derrick Mayes , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Mayes will make his return to the starting lineup this week. Rookie Darrell 
Jackson has been demoted to the No. 3 WR spot.  

 Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/03/00 
 Ricky Watters has been pronounced fit to start this week. Alexander should 
see some carries in relief, though.  

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Kitna will start again this week as the Seahawks take on the Chargers, who 
have a vulnerable, but opportunistic secondary.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Peterson has quickly proved he is still a reliable kicker. The Chiefs will 
give him consistent opportunties to score this year.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Mean Machine Updated 11/03/00 
 Janikowski is finally living up to his billing after a rough start. The 
Raiders will give him plenty of opportunities to score against the Chiefs 
this week.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Richardson is still seeing some carries and remains an occasional passing 
target. He is worth a reserve spot on rosters in larger leagues.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/03/00 
 Anders is showing signs of becoming a reliable Fantasy runner. He may still 
give away some carries in goal-line packages, though.  

 Rickey Dudley , TE OAK - Risk Managers Updated 11/03/00 
 Dudley has become a Fantasy non-factor. Don't expect much from him against 
an aggressive Kansas City defense.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - FDIC Updated 11/03/00 
 Gonzalez has always played well against Oakland. Expect him to find the end 
zone at least once on Sunday.  

 James Jett , WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/03/00 
 Jett's starting job might be about to slip away. Oakland is simply waiting 
for Andre Rison to have a breakthrough game as a Raider.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Brown usually comes up big in AFC West contests. Look for him to terrorize 
the Chiefs this week.  

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Fear Updated 11/03/00 
 The Chiefs usually have trouble containing Gannon. Look for KC to play a 
containment style of defense rather than risk getting burned on blitzes.   

 Ed McCaffrey , WR DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 McCaffrey could have a good game against the Jets. Brian Griese will look to 
take pressure off a returning Terrell Davis by utilizing the passing game 
early.  

 Rod Smith , WR DEN - Ramiro Updated 11/03/00 
 Smith is a good play this week. He will use his height to outmanuever the 
Jets' cornerbacks.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Elam's efficiency will be tested by the swirling winds in New Jersey this 
week. The Meadowlands will present him with a stiff challenge.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 Carswell has become less of a factor in the passing game. He still may score 
occasionally in goal-line packages.  

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/03/00 
 The Broncos will be severely tested by the Jets' passing game this week. 
Vinny Testaverde has been sacked only seven times this season.  

 Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Anderson will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Terrell Davis this week, but 
should still see some carries as a change-of-pace back.  

 Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/03/00 
 Jackson has lost his starting spot. Derrick Mayes appears healthy for the 
first time this year and will start opposite Sean Dawkins against San Diego.

Yep, I hit the site every day to check out the weather and snow reports.  I 
am excited because I haven't experienced real winter like conditions for 3 
years. 
Have you been skiing before?

And what exactly did we mean by "English major finally coming into use"??

Anyways, it sucks that most all of the UT games out here are on friggin Pay
Per View.  But I think I will have the distinct pleasure of getting to watch
the UT-A&M game in a house full of A&M officers so I hope we do well.

If my leave gets approved and I can find a ticket in, I should/may be in
town from the 23DEC to 1JAN.  I'll know by tue or wed and let ya know.

What's been up with you, how's Enron treatin ya?

Brett

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing "It's Not Easy Being  Green."

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as "Temperatures of the 80's"

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome." Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,"

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of "fairness" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She
  immediately called Saint Peter and said, "This is Sister Margaret. There's
  been a terrible mistake!"


  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The
next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter and called him back.
  "Please set this error straight before tomorrow," she begged. "There's an
orgy planned for tonight, and everyone must attend!"


  "Of course, Sister, "he said. "I'll get you out of there right away."
  Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning he
  received another phone call from hell. He picked up the receiver and
  heard, "Hey, Pete, this is Maggie. Never mind!"

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
"V" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    "Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate," said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    "Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to "pain and suffering" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    "We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers," 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    "Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    "It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem," said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    "I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat."
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    "More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them," he said.
    "But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    "People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing."
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles "quite a 
few" dog bite claims and he has seen "a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    "There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs," Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    "For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm," said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    "We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite," Carroll said. "But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    "The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises."
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.
    "We had been running at about a 3 p________________________________

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

Please ask your traders if they have signed on to the messenging board system 
and take a vote on how they like it.  I need to report to our setup team 
whether to or not it will be a permanent system or if they should take it 
away.

Thank You.

Three heavily Democratic counties continue to handcount
ballots that were meant to be counted by machine.

As the process continues, it has become apparent why
machines are used to count these ballots.

There have been reports of Bush ballots in the Gore
pile, counters using ballots as fans, and chads on the
floor and on the counting tables....

Cick here to watch a member of the Miami-Dade County
Canvassing Board bend, scratch, poke and press a
ballot during the manual recount...

Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words....

Subject: FW: REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE


FOR THOSE OF YOU WORKING FOR US COMPANIES!!
 > -----NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 > To the citizens of the United States of America,
 > In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and
thus
 > to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of
your
 > independence, effective today.
 >
 > Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial
duties
 > over all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except
Utah,
 > which she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon.
Tony
 > Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware
that
 > there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for

 > America without the need for further elections.  Congress and the
 > Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next
year
 > to determine whether any of you noticed.
 >
 > To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the
following
 > rules are introduced with immediate effect:
 >
 > 1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English
Dictionary.
 > Then look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You
will be
 > amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
Generally,
 > you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up
 > "vocabulary".  Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with

 > filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and

 > inefficient form of communication.  Look up "interspersed".
 >
 > 2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft
know
 > on your behalf.
 >
 > 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian
accents. It
 > really isn't that hard.
 >
 > 4.      Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English
actors as
 > the good  guys.
 >
 > 5.      You should relearn your original national anthem, "God
Save The
 > Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not
want you
 > to get confused and give up half way through.
 >
 > 6.      You should stop playing American "football".  There is
only
 > one kind of football.  What you refer to as American "football" is
not
 > a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a
world
 > outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays
"American"
 > football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should
instead
 > play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played
with
 > the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough
will, in
 > time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American
 > "football", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty
 > seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies).  We are
 > hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side by 2005.
 >
 > 7.      You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear

 > weapons if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were
not
 > aware that there is a world outside your borders should count
yourselves
 > lucky.  The Russians have never been the bad guys.  "Merde" is
French for
 > "shit".
 >
 > 8.      July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will
be a
 > new national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called
"Indecisive
 > Day".
 >
 > 9.      All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it
is for
 > your own good.  When we show you German cars, you will understand
what we
 > mean.
 >
 > 10.     Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us
crazy.
 >
 >  Thank you for your cooperation.

I saw you called last night.  What was up?  I tried to call a few times.  Is
there any way wew can meet today or tomorrow for the TV?  It is due and I
would rather pay you some money instead another wasted payment with them.
BTW, how much is the payout for most points in the league?  How much for
second?

Plus                             7 other reasons to shop  early

[IMAGE]

8.

FREE                             SHIPPING on all  orders over $100, through 
November                             22.
?

7.

We've                             teamed  up with Toysrus.com  to offer you 
toys and savings so massive, even  our                             North Pole 
competitors are envious. 
?

6.
Create                           a Wish List      at Amazon.com and you just 
might win everything on  it--up                           to $5,000. Woo-hoo!
?
5.
By                           shopping early at  Amazon.com,  you eliminate 
stress. Carolers won't seem nearly  as                           irritating. 
?
4.
Though                           reindeer are  cute, our delivery service is 
more reliable.                           And  no fog delays. 
?
3.
                           You can browse through all 17 of our  stores 
without                           being accosted by a persistent  perfume 
sales clerk.
?
2.
                           Free parking. 
?
1.
SHIPPING                           IS FREE on  orders of $100 or more. (Our 
Head Elf made                           us say  that again.)

A clarification - you can only bid whole dollars for players, i.e no $1.50 
bids - O'neal.

Can both of you forward the telluride pictures to me so I can get them 
developed?  

Dad - they reside in the "my documents" folder under the "my pictures" 
heading.


Thanks,

Professor Webb, 

We would like to have a scrimmage/practice with your team this Wednesday.    
The aggie teams have already held practice as of Sunday and are scrimmaging 
this Wednesday as well  (to which we are not invited).   As they pose the 
greatest hurdle to obtaining the tickets, it is essential that we prepare in 
similar fashion.....

However, we are unable to find a LIGHTED field to practice upon (Memorial is 
unlit)..     


If anyone knows of a lighted field for practice  (Rice University???), please 
contact me ASAP so we can schedule a practice for Wednesday evening.


- Mike  ext  37842


=== 

Webb, I'm counting on you not to let the Longhorn tradition down....

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

Subject: Flag Football Schedule (Again)

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Hey Danny,

When does the next flag football season start at the YMCA?  We would like to 
play in the next league.

Also,  are you planning to have another flag football tournament this 
summer?  If so, when?

Thanks,

Eric

Subject: FYI -New Product on EOL

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new "tokenized 
period" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five 
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle 
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a 
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back 
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to 
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be 
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end 
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open. 

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before 
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or 
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the 
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback 
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is 
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a 
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the 
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of 
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds. 
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the 
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense 
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on 
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the 
"twins" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving 
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in 
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block 


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver 
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick 
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield 
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an 
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As 
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into 
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most 
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can 
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never 
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of 
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down 
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to 
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if 
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he 
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a 
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field 
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback. 
Don't pitch the ball to the other team. 

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage 
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the 
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle 
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the 
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If 
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should 
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play 
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB 
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs 
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is 
Crucial.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a "realistic chance" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a "slugo" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. "I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season," he said. "It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference."

Good morning. Looks like Mother will be in town this weekend. So, dinner
Friday @ 7 is fine with us if you are still available. If so, lets try
something different. How about Anthony's, Baroque, Brownstone or River Oaks
Grill? Your choice. Dutch treat. Let me know and I will get
reservations.-Dad

here are some selected quotes I thought readers might find interesting.=20
=09
=09 On the season so far and how the team has changed from last year:=20
=09
=09 "We're excited about the position we're in being 4-0, and we're a confi=

team going down to Dallas. We are more mature. We understand more. We play=

=09
=09 "Turnovers were a major factor. We had two interceptions that hit us ri=
ght=20
in the chest and we drop. Both of those interceptions led to scores for=20
them."=20
=09
=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20
=09
=09 "I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=
 same=20
offense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =
a=20
good part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=
=20
he'll be in there the whole go unless something happens."=20
=09
=09 On OU's running game:=20
=09
=09 "I hope our running game is a factor in this game. We're quite a bit mo=
re=20
confident in our running game because we've emphasized it."=20
=09
=09 On going up, 17-0, in the first quarter and then losing last year's gam=
e,=20
38-28:=20
=09
=09 "We set the tone early last year and didn't finish the tone. There's no=
=20
protecting a lead for three quarters. And Major Applewhite made some throws=
,=20
you watch on film, that you can't believe."=20
=09
=09 On OU having lost three straight to Texas:=20
=09
=09 "We get e-mails and letters. We know what the situation is, and we need=
 to=20
win." =20

=09
=09
=09=20
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: I heard rumors that the Royal-Memorial Stadium will one day be the =
=20
largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country, seating some =
=20
114,000 folks. What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20
=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=
=20
Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=
 a=20
good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20
would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=
en=20
the focus would turn to the south end.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Kalen Thornton =20
=09
=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20
=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=
 Carl=20
Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=
=20
would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=
=20
wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20
Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20
considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=
e=20
tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=
=20
playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =
by=20
holding him out this season.=20
=09
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=
 =20
second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=
=20
about the punt team.=20
=09
=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call "fair catch=
." I=20
first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=
=20
making an early tackle by  invading the "halo" and receiving a 5-yard penal=
ty=20
is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.
=09
=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=
p the=20
receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=
=20
make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=
he=20
penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=
th=20
and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20
=09
=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=
=20
against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20
Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=
=20
5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=
ick.=20
Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=
=20
am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20
=09?? Jerry Secrets=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=
ame.=20
The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=
=20
angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=
ay=20
side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=
=20
team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=
=20
Saturday, it did.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20
=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=
till=20
seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=
e=20
and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=
gh=20
ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=
ne=20
wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=
=20
was premature.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Josh Heupel =20
=09
=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=
y can=20
answer the call? =20
=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=
s.=20
UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=
=20
possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20
D-backs.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =
keys?=20
=09?? Sara Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=
=20
Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=
er=20
picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=
as,=20
do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=
?=20
Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20
continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20
season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=
=20
gets injured.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=
te=20
has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =
It=20
has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks "starters" and insist on=20
token starts for Chris Simms.=20
=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=
 THE=20
starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=
=20
of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=
ho=20
then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =
As=20
fine as Simms' =20
=09
=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=
=20
realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=
on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=
d=20
half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20
rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20
superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=
=20
hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=
ay=20
too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20
matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=
=20
onto Stockton's pocket?=20
=09
=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=
hat=20
they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=
=20
are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=
=20
special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=
o=20
have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=
=20
said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=
as=20
the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=
=20
assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=
gh=20
the middle of the line.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=
alize=20
what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20
wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20
O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20
=09
=09Guess what? Most of these "great" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=
 a=20
freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=
th=20
current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =
or=20
two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=
=20
biggie.=20
=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some "Braveheart"-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=
=20
the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =
as=20
the perennial powers.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=
ve=20
the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=
=20
NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=
al=20
help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=
=20
guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20
=09?? Arland Bishop=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =
back=20
to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =
in=20
the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20
=09
=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =
The=20
only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=
=20
are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=
do=20
in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=
e=20
Field.=20
=09
=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=
 be=20
another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20
obviously on the horizon.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=
n=20
do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=
ing=20
to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=
.=20
If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=
=20
this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20
=09?? Mike McDonald=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=
n and=20
works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=
r=20
him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=
=20
senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=
=20

=09
=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=

been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=

game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=
=20
the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=

like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20
something negative to heap on the program.
=09
=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =
his=20
coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=
h=20
the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=

about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=

you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20
=09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=
ing=20
up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20
storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=
oo=20
big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=
o=20
burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20
re-evaluated and said, "Wait, they really aren't that good."
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20
star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=
t=20
to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =

the foundation to bring up.=20
=09
=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=

then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=

bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20
itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09
=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=

believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=

have been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=

=09

=09
=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=

with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=
=20
Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20
coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =
of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=
=20
both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=
=20
but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20
country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=

offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=
=20
time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=

this line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=

work with these guys.=20

=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=

at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20

=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=

every chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=

he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=

is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=
=20
rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=

=09

Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.


Call with questions.

Hi Folks,
?
I'll?have the full blown matchups very late  tonight / Friday morning but for 
you last minute waiver wire watchers, here's  something you might be 
interested in:? Chris Warren might be worth a shot  as the Eagles have signed 
him as anticipated according to the AP.? Full  article is below.? I'm betting 
he's still got something left in the  tank.? I'm also betting coach Andy Reid 
is smart enough to figure a way for  him to contribute in some fashion. 
McNabb is not a QB that must be overly  protected so the fact Warren may not 
know all the pass protection blocks isn't  quite as critical as it normally 
is.? He could be worth a  shot.
?
See you Friday morning,
?
Joe

>From the article: http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/eagles/thurs.htm?  The 
Philadelphia  Eagles have said for weeks that they're not looking ahead to 
the NFL playoffs.  But by adding recently waived running back Chris Warren on 
Thursday, the Eagles  may be thinking about what they need to succeed if they 
reach the postseason.  The Eagles claimed Warren one day after he was waived 
by the Dallas Cowboys.  

Warren, in his 11th NFL season,  will join the Eagles for Friday's practice 
and will be available Sunday against  the Cleveland Browns. 

''He's been in the league 11 years and at one  point he was one of the best 
backs in the game,'' Eagles head coach Andy Reid  said. ''Is he that now? I 
don't know. But he's a big back who has played well  this season.'' 

In Dallas this season, Warren rushed for 254 yards and  two touchdowns and 
averaged 4.3 yards per carry He also caught 31 passes for 302  yards and a 
touchdown. 

But in last Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay, Warren  misplayed a pass that 
deflected off his hands and was intercepted and returned  for a touchdown. He 
was benched after that play, and then was involved in a  shouting match with 
a Dallas coach on the sideline. 

Three days later, he  was waived. Dallas owner Jerry Jones said Warren 
''wasn't in the plans moving  forward,'' but Warren said he was cut because 
he wouldn't accept a one-year  contract extension for 2001 at his current 
salary, $715,000. 

Now Warren  is an Eagle. Philadelphia is looking to add a spark to a running 
game that has  been struggling since the season-ending injury to running back 
Duce Staley in  October. 

The running-back-by-committee group of Darnell Autry, Stanley  Pritchett and 
Brian Mitchell has averaged less than 3 yards per carry in the  last four 
games. Philadelphia, 9-5 and needing just one win in games against  Cleveland 
and Cincinnati to make the playoffs for the first time since 1996, has  
relied on quarterback Donovan McNabb almost exclusively to make the offense 
go.  

McNabb is averaging nearly 75% of the team's total offensive output.  

Warren began his NFL career in Seattle and ran for more than 1,000 yards  in 
four consecutive seasons, 1992-95. He made three Pro Bowls during that time.  

Seattle's career leading ground gainer, Warren has 7,654 yards rushing  in 
his career, which began in 1990. 

Warren signed with Dallas as an  unrestricted free agent prior to the 1998 
season. He has been a backup behind  Emmitt Smith the last three seasons. 

To make room on the active roster,  the Eagles waived wide receiver Alex Van 
Dyke.

of us in the majority are always  tippy-toeing around, trying to make sure we
don't step on the toes or hurt  the feelings of the humorless. And you can
bet there's a lawyer standing on  every corner making sure we don't.
> >
> > Take this prayer  deal.? It's absolutely ridiculous.? Some atheist goes
to a high  school football game, hears a kid say a short prayer before the
game and gets  offended.? So he hires a lawyer and goes to court and asks
somebody to  pay him a whole bunch of money for all the damage done to him.
You would have  thought the kid kicked him in the crotch.? Damaged for life
by a  30-second prayer?
> >
> > Am I missing something here? I don't  believe in Santa Claus, but I'm not
going to sue somebody for singing a  Ho-Ho-Ho song in December.? I don't
agree with Darwin, but I didn't go  out and hire a lawyer when my high school
teacher taught his theory of  evolution.
> >
> > Life, liberty or your pursuit of happiness  will not be endangered
because someone says a 30-second prayer before a  football game. So what's
the big deal?? It's not like somebody is up  there reading the entire book of
Acts.
> >
> > They're just  talking to a God they believe in and asking him to grant
safety to the  players on the field and the fans going home from the game.
> >
>  > "But it's a Christian prayer," some will argue. Yes, and this is  the
United States of America, a country founded on Christian principles And  we
are in the Bible Belt.? According to our very own phone book,  Christian
churches outnumber all others better than 200-to-1.? So what  would you
expect - somebody chanting Hare Krishna?? If I went to a  football game in
> > Jerusalem, I would expect to hear a Jewish  prayer.? If I went to a
soccer game in Baghdad, I would expect to hear a  Muslim prayer.? If I went
to a ping pong match in China, I would expect  to hear someone pray to
Buddha.

> > And I wouldn't be  offended.? It wouldn't bother me one bit. When in
Rome...
>  >
> > "But what about the atheists?" is another argument.? What  about them?
Nobody is asking them to be baptized.? We're not going to  pass the
collection plate.? Just humor us for 30 seconds.? If  that's asking too much,
bring a walkman or a pair of ear plugs.? Go to  the bathroom.? Visit? the
concession stand.? Call your  lawyer.
> >
> > Unfortunately, one or two will make that call.  One or two will tell
thousands what they can and cannot do.? I don't  think a short prayer at a
football game is going to shake the world's  foundations.? Nor do I believe
that not praying will result in more  serious injuries on the field or more
fatal car crashes after the game.?  In fact, I'm not so sure God would even

downsides of omnipresence. If  God really liked sports, the Russians would
never have won a single gold  medal, New York would never play in a World
Series and Deon Sanders' toe  would be healed by now.

courts strip us of all our  rights.? Our parents and grandparents taught us
to pray before eating,  to pray before we go to sleep.? Our Bible tells us
just to pray without  ceasing.? Now a handful of people and their lawyers are
telling us to  cease praying.? God, help us.

Subject: Yahoo!'s Picks of the Week (November 20, 2000)


Here's the latest email installment of Yahoo!'s Picks of the Week. Thank
you for your interest in our feature. As always, you can access the full
document that surrounds these picks online at:

http://www.yahoo.com/picks/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Weekly Picks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WW II Codes and Ciphers

 http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/

This homespun site was created by Tony Sale, a man instrumental in
preserving, restoring, and curating the historical collection at
Bletchley Park. Headquarters of British code-breaking during World
War II, Bletchley was "Britain's best kept secret" -- the place
where the German Enigma was finally deciphered in an incredible
cooperative super-effort. Detailed tutorials for the mathematically
inclined explain how the Enigma cipher machine worked and how the
Lorenz code was broken by the British-built Colossus machine. A
Bletchley Park photo album presents snapshots of an ordinary-looking,
extraordinary place.

--------------------

The Brownie Camera @ 100: A Celebration

 http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/features/brownieCam/brownieCam.shtml

In February of 1900, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced the
Brownie, a compact portable camera that cost $1. During the first
year, over 150,000 cameras were sold. The Brownie was designed and
intended for children, but it's explosive popularity led to the
birth of popular photography, the rise of photojournalism, and the
all-American snapshot. Kodak's gorgeously designed site offers
dozens of recollections, original advertisements, audio commentary
clips, and plenty of Brownie-shot snaps.

--------------------

BoondocksNet.com

 http://www.boondocksnet.com/

This site was created by historian and Mark Twain scholar Jim Zwick.
It began in early 1995 as a page about Twain's writing on the U.S.
expansionist war in the Philippines; since then, it has become an
essential library of historical texts, articles, photographs, and
political cartoons for the study of imperialism and anti-imperialism
in the late 19th and early 20th century. Remarkable e-texts and
related gems include: Arthur Conan Doyle's The Crime of the Congo,
Hull House founder Jane Addams' The Long Road of Woman's Memory,
and an interpretive archive of 3D stereoscopic photographs. And
the title? Boondocks, which means rough country, is derived from
the Tagalog word for mountain, and entered American English around
the time of the Phillipine-American War.

--------------------

Antimatter: Mirror of the Universe

 http://livefromcern.web.cern.ch/livefromcern/antimatter/index2.html

>From CERN in Switzerland, the amazing particle physics laboratory
that brought us Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web, comes this
introduction to antimatter. Tune in on November 21 to a live
educational webcast produced in cooperation with San Francisco's
Exploratorium or listen anytime to the archived presentation. Take
a guided video tour of the Low Energy Anti-Proton Ring (LEAR), a
particle accelerator that lets scientists create and observe
antimatter in a quest to understand how the universe works. Read
about Paul Dirac and the history of antimatter or see how it has
seeped in to our daily lives.

--------------------

Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World

 http://www.nypl.org/utopia/

In bilingual collaboration with the BibliothSque nationale de France
(France's national library), this exhibition explores the roots of
utopian thinking from ancient traditions to modern times. Travel
from the Garden of Eden to the City of God, then on to Thomas More's
definitive 1516 work, Utopia, a word that means both "good place"
and "no place." The exquisite image collection covers the Enlightenment,
19th-century revolutionary dreams, 20th-century dystopic nightmares,
and 21st-century metaworlds. The paintings and illustrations will
make you wish you were going nowhere too... or would that be
Erewhon?

--------------------

This is SportsCenter

 http://espn.go.com/thisissportscenter/

Which is better: ESPN's SportsCenter or the commercials for the
show? If you're a fan of the latter, you'll enjoy this rotating
selection of choice ads. No dumb beer ad humor here. SportsCenter
ads are like tiny Saturday Night Live skits: self-deprecating,
offbeat, and usually very funny, even if you don't like sports. So
treat yourself to a two-minute sanity timeout.

--------------------

short stories at east of the web

 http://www.short-stories.co.uk/

British web-design firm east of the web presents this splendid
collection of short stories organized by theme: fiction, romance,
crime, sci-fi & fantasy, humor, horror, hyperfiction, children's,
and non-fiction. How perfectly civil of them. Most of the stories
are wonderful, and thanks to public interest copyright law, they're
all free. Read them onscreen, print them out for the train ride
home, or download them onto your Palm Pilot.

--------------------

Lego Star Wars Trilogy

 http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf/

The product of over 2,500 hours of monomaniacal determination, the
Lego Star Wars Trilogy recreates 180 key scenes from the original
series. Relive all of those magical moments through Lego-lensed
glasses: the Tatooine races, the Hoth battles, the Ewok dances.
You won't find any Millennium Falcon or Imperial Walker Lego sets
in stores; these are all custom-made models. As your Japanese host
S. Fujita proclaims, "I completed this project by myself without
any support." Thank you, S. Fujita.

...Hard to believe this was written by a high school  student...

A Columbine High School student wrote:

The paradox of  our time in history is that we have taller buildings,
but
shorter tempers;  wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints; we spend
more,
but have less; we  buy more, but enjoy it less.

We have bigger houses and smaller families;  more conveniences, but
less
time; we have more degrees, but less sense;  more knowledge, but less
judgment; more experts, but less solutions; more  medicine, but less
wellness.

We have multiplied our possessions, but  reduced our values.

We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too  often.

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added  years
to
life, not life to years.

We've been all the way to the  moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the
street to meet the new  neighbor.

We've conquered outer space, but not inner space; we've cleaned  up the
air,
but polluted the soul; we've split the atom, but not our  prejudice.

We have higher incomes, but lower morals; we've become long  on
quantity,
but short on quality.

These are the times of tall men,  and short character; steep profits,
and
shallow  relationships.

These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare;  more leisure,
but
less fun; more kinds of food, but less  nutrition.

These are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier  houses,
but
broken homes.

It is a time when there is much in the  show window and nothing in the
stockroom; a time when technology can bring  this letter to you, and a
time
when you can choose either to forward this  message and make a difference
or just hit delete.

Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do 
have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will 
not show up.  So, let me know whether or not you will be there.

Hi  Folks

Before we get  started...

Congratulations on being in  the playoff hunt.? That's something to be prou=
d=20
of.? You have to be a  little bit lucky to get this far but don't hesitate =
to=20
pat yourself on the back  as skill plays a huge part.? Judging from the=20
emails, tons of you are still  in mix.? Don't forget about our Wall of=20
Champions feature  where we'll showcase league winners.? Stay tuned for mor=
e =20
details.

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20
Players.? As we head down the  final weekend for many teams, identifying=20
those players moving up or down can be  the difference between?dominating=
=20
your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in  the money.? As we head into our  16=
th=20
week of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable that some guys  will have=
 made=20
both the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make sure you understand, what we=01,r=
e =20
talking about is players that are moving.?  In other words, a player like T=
E=20
Ricky Dudley could appear on the  downgrade list and still be good enough t=
o=20
be a starter in your league.? It just means I=01,m concerned about the  way=
 he=20
seems to be heading.?  Likewise, a player like WR Willie Jackson may make t=
he=20
upgrade list even  though he=01,s still fairly far down the list of WRs.? I=
t=01,s=20
all about which direction players  are moving.? Keeping an eye on these =20
trends as they can very often make all the difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Jeff Garcia (SF)?  Cheatsheets.net Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to=
=20
roll.? No  coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this we=
ek.

QB Donovan McNabb (Phi)? Mixed  emotions here as I've been hyping McNabb fo=
r=20
weeks as the guy carrying the  Eagles offense.? But seeing him on my=20
opponent's roster in the FanEx  playoffs yesterday was less than heartening=
=20
throwing for 4 TDs and 390  yards.? Just be aware the Eagles are off this=
=20
week and won't return till  week 17.?=20

QB Jon Kitna (Sea)? Like Mike  Holmgren, maybe I've been too critical of=20
Kitna.? He continues to play well  and while it likely won't be in Seattle,=
=20
he looks like a starter for some team  in 2001.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? A telling  mark of a great QB is how he performs when=
=20
he comes with less than his "A"  game.? Brooks looked much less in synch=20
Sunday and clearly struggled at  times making a few bad throws and missing=
=20
open receivers.? Yet he hung in  and still posted outstanding numbers.? His=
=20
108 rushing yards quietly add to  the points.? He's a player.? I'm starting=
=20
him with few  reservations.?=20

QB Kerry Collins (NYG)? You  have to believe his confidence is sky high.? H=
e=20
obviously benefited from  the return of Ike Hilliard (who looked very good)=
?=20
This team is looking  very tough and very balanced right now.? The running=
=20
game is just good  enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so=20
dominant that it hurts the  QB.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac)? It's  really weird.? When the hype finally subsides=
=20
about this guy, he starts  delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype.? Go=
=20
figure.?=20

QB Kurt Warner (StL)? This may  have been the greatest QB performance in th=
e=20
history of the league without  scoring a TD.? The guy was incredible=20
completing 84% of his passes (27 of  32)? Completing 84% with an average pa=
ss=20
of 12.8 yards is sick.? The  TDs will come as Warner looked as good as I've=
=20
ever seen him placing the ball  perfectly and directing his offense.

QB Ray Lucas (NYJ)? Keep an eye  on Vinnie's groin.? Better yet, watch the=
=20
injury reports for news on  Vinnie's groin.? That's better.? We should know=
=20
more soon but if it's  serious, Lucas will get the start.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Marshall Faulk (StL)? I know  you don't need me to list him here but it'=
s=20
worth noting I think he may be the  best player in the league right now.?=
=20
Martz fed him the ball 25 times and  he delivered.

RB Eddie George (Ten)? George  showed outstanding pass receiving skills and=
=20
added 2 receiving TDs to go with  his rushing TD.? He reinjured his sore to=
e=20
but looks to be ok.? Keep  an eye on it though.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? What a  shocker.? Taylor runs wild again as we=20
predicted.? He did tweak a knee  so watch that but if he can go full speed,=
=20
he's a no brainer starter against  just about anyone.

RB James Allen (Chi)? If  departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was=
=20
dead (don't get excited Bears  fans, he's not), he'd be spinning in his gra=
ve=20
to see Allen garner 37 carries  Sunday.? Be a little leery though as a 2.6=
=20
ypc carry average only works  when you carry the ball a ton.?=20

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)? After  fading badly, Prentice comes roaring back=
=20
with a 2 TD performance.? He only  had 46 yards on 17 attempts but the TDs=
=20
are huge.? The Brown offense  featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson=
=20
occasionally at QB but they looked  much better.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? What  else can you say?? The Denver OL is having=20
another Pro Bowl season.?  Anderson is a must start vs any team right now.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'm very  nervous if I'm Dorsey Levens right now.?=20
Green's been an offensive stalwart  carrying the load week after week.?=20
Everyone always knew he had the  potential to be this good but now he's=20
delivering.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal)? As was  mentioned on the broadcast yesterday, "Someo=
ne=20
forgot to tell the Redskins this  game is a rivalry"? You know the Cowboys=
=20
and Emmitt in particular had to  enjoy humiliating the Redskins.? It would =
be=20
a bold move even for him but I  wouldn't be surprised in the least to see=
=20
Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie  before his obligatory three games are up.=
?=20

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes=
=20
me look bad for dissing him this  Summer...? Against the Cardinals this wee=
k,=20
he has the chance to be even  better.

RB Warrick Dunn (TB)? If Dunn  had any help, the Bucs would scary.? Right=
=20
now, he's doing it all by  himself.? Which probably isn't a bad thing for=
=20
Dunn owners.

RB Tony Richardson (KC)?  Richardson netted 5.2 ypc on 17 carries.? Donnell=
=20
Bennett looks to have  cartilage damage to his knee so Richardson's workloa=
d=20
should increase.?  It's a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther=20
Cunningham to give Richardson  more looks.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car)?  Don't hold your breath but Biakabutuka is=
=20
making noises about returning to the  lineup this week.? We'll see...

RB Terry Allen (NO)? In a  lesser version of Denver's OL, it appears most=
=20
anyone can run effectively behind  these guys.? Allen looked rejuvenated=20
Sunday and should only get better as  he gets familiar with the system.

RB Chris Warren (Phi)? Remember  that he's off this week but if your league=
=20
runs through week 17, he could be a  factor.?=20

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)??  Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong=20
numbers.? As is Jon  Kitna.? Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could=20
continue his  roll.

WR Torrance Small / Charles Johnson  (Phi)? Look what QB Donovan McNabb can=
=20
do when his WRs decide to  show up.? If they can continue to play well, thi=
s=20
team could be  scary.? Remember they're off this week but return in week 17=
.

WR Amani Toomer (NYG)? Of the resurging Giants,  Toomer's leading the=20
charge.? He's making plays all over the field and even  had a nice run agai=
n.

WR Terrell Owens (SF)? The  scary part is he could have been even better th=
an=20
the 129 yard / 1 TD  performance Sunday.? He looked very good coming back=
=20
from the toe injury  and should only get better.? The 49ers are trying to=
=20
nail down their WR  corps for 2001 and Owens is making a statement.

WR Ed McCaffrey (Den)? It's  easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod=
=20
Smith but the truth of the matter  is that they're both excellent WRs.? I=
=20
love McCaffrey and his 6th grade  shoulder pads.? He's the anti-Eric=20
Dickerson when it comes to pads (or lack  thereof)? Easy Ed goes with prett=
y=20
much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder  pads and that's it.? Oh yeah, he's al=
so=20
a great WR...

WR Darrell Jackson (Sea)?  Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and=20
delivered.? I see few reasons  why he won't continue to shine.

WR Torry Holt (StL)? It's tough  to predict which Ram WR will catch the=20
passes from Warner but as I said several  weeks ago, Holt may be the best W=
R=20
on the team.? And that's no sleight to  Isaac Bruce - Holt's that good.?=20

WR Terry Glenn (NE)??  Glenn's putting together one of his most complete=20
seasons.? And Bledsoe's  continuing to play pretty good football which help=
s.

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? 1  catch.? 1 TD.? You gotta like a guy who gets rig=
ht=20
to the point.?  Joe Horn is the clear #1 threat but Jackson is a serious=20
option too.

WR Germane Crowell (Det)? This  didn't look like a guy returning from a=20
broken leg.? He should continue to  get better as he becomes more involved =
in=20
the flow of things.=20

WR Bobby Shaw (Pit)? It seems  hard to believe, but Bobby Shaw is a=20
legitimate starter in many leagues.?  He's getting lots of looks and the=20
Steeler are throwing the ball.=20

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? Hilliard  looked well rested as he roared back onto=
=20
the scene.? An sprained knee  suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increa=
se=20
Hilliard's playing time even  further.

WR Donald Hayes (Car)? Hayes  looked better as expected and turned in a nic=
e=20
game catching 5 passes for 77  yards.? The Panthers need to remain focused=
=20
but if they can, Hayes could  contribute.

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min)?  McWilliams again was active catching 5 passes=
=20
for 53 yards.? I like any  receiver on this team.

TE Andrew Glover (NO)? Glover's  starting to become a very integral part of=
=20
the New Orleans passing game.?  It's hard to imagine this team losing=20
Ricky?Williams, Jeff Blake and Cam  Cleeland.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? He's no  Wesley Walls but he's more than adequate.

TE Greg Clark (SF)? He only had  24 yards but the 4 receptions were a nice=
=20
bonus.?=20

?

QBs Moving  Down

QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)? The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the =
=20
guy we remembered.? This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the=
 =20
dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential.

QB Jeff  George (Was)? I've gotta say I'm really surprised George didn't =
=20
post some great numbers.? Albert Connell isn't nearly as good as he thinks =
=20
he is and that may be part of the problem.

QB Steve  Beuerlein (Car)? It's clear to everyone that 1999 was a career =
=20
year.? He's still subject to a great game here and there but he's just too =
=20
streaky to lean very heavily on.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? This guy just isn't very good.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? I've never been a big Charlie Batch fan although=
=20
he's  certainly had his days.? He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and=20
possibly  losing Herman Moore won't help.? (Although German Crowell is back=
)

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal)? I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve =
=20
Young a call.? A sore back is one thing.? Not remembering your kid's  names=
=20
is an entirely different matter. It's not worth it, Guy.

QB Ryan  Leaf (SD)? Part of it was Baltimore.? A large part of it was  Leaf=
.

QB Jay  Fiedler (Mia)? Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non =20
throwing shoulder.? The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely =20
whether it'll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB.

QB Vinnie  Testeverde (NYJ)? Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may=
 =20
not be serious.? He's not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this=
 =20
one.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Ron  Dayne (NYG)? It's just hard to get excited about starting this guy =
=20
as he's such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan.? He's always liable to=
 =20
grab that short yardage TD but you just don't know when or where they'll =
=20
happen.

RB Jerald  Moore (FA)? Things change quickly in this league.? A few  weeks=
=20
ago, Moore looked to be the #1 RB.? Now he's unemployed.

RB Darnell  Autry (Phi)?? I'd expect that Chris Warren will cut into his =
=20
time when they return.

RB Jamel  White (Cle)? Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched=
 =20
this week.

RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? He came back to reality this week.? On top of  that,=
=20
it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to  t=
ry=20
and return this week.

?

WRs Moving  Down=20

WR Herman  Moore (Det)?? Moore suffered?a neck stinger  Sunday.? He could=
=20
likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good  returning from his=
=20
injury.

WR Tai  Streets (SF)? Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action  a=
s=20
the 49ers tried to see what they had for 2001 but with the return of Terrel=
l =20
Owens, it looks like Streets will be limited.

WR  Courtney Hawkins (Pit)? He's losing time to Bobby Shaw.? The  Steeler W=
Rs=20
seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw.

WR Danny  Farmer (Cin)? Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot =
=20
alongside Peter Warrick but it doesn't look like it's going to make any =20
difference.

WR J.J.  Stokes (SF)? Like Tai Streets, Stokes suffers from the return of =
=20
Terrell Owens.?=20

WR  Sylvester Morris (KC)? Morris continues his regression which  should se=
nd=20
red flags as owners look towards 2001.

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)? With Shaun King struggling, I don't see a  brigh=
t=20
future for Keyshawn ahead.? He sounds like a politician conceding  when he=
=20
speaks of the team finding it's identity in running the ball.?=20

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? In the up and down season from Anthony Becht, it =
=20
looks like he's headed down a bit.? The injury to Testeverde affects his =
=20
stock in a negative way.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he =20
suffered a broken ankle.

TE Jeff  Thomason (Phi)? Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the =
=20
primary TE.?=20

TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman, =
=20
LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon.

What's up guys?  Sorry for this mass e-mail, but you have got to see this
... be careful if you are viewing this at work or anywhere public.  I know
there are a few of you I haven't been in touch with for a while, but please
forgive me as I've been tied up in a shithole in Paducah, KY.  I hope all is
well with you.  Enjoy this e-mail.  BTW - Jared, this is a REAL forward ...
send me more of this stuff instead of the other crap that comes my way!
Adios,
Patrick

If only I knew who these girls were!

Subject: Paintball Tomorrow

We are getting a group together to play paintaball tomorrow at around 10 am.  
We will be playing at Adventure Village (just north of Intercontinental 
Airport on FM 1960).  Their website is www.adventurevillage.com.  The total 
cost should be somewhere between $30-$40 per person ( about $15 for a gun and 
$6 per 100 paintballs).  Let me know if you can make it.

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Mean Machine Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

-Mike  ext 37842


--
Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

Melissa,

Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number 
is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo.  
I will follow up with these specific details.

Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Check out the part about Simms weight. =20


Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

"I don't want to be rude," he said last week. "I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ..."

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged," Hardin said. "It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him."

"The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up," Applewhite said. "I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five."

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

"I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it," he said. "I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason."

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

"So what if I'm tired?" he said. "I can rest when I die."

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged," he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

"I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris," Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. "But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever."

"It's remarkable the way he's come back," said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. "In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight."

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, "I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all."

"He's the same old Major," cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

"The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have," Applewhite said. "At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l."

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

"I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over," he said. "I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

"It's going to come, and it'll get worse," Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. "To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it."

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, "History of American=20
Baseball." The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.  Do you want to continue this

Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior

Once upon a midnight dreary
  While the Crew rested, victorious and weary
        There came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping
        Rapping at Kyle Field's door.
        "T'is a Heisman hopeful," Hankwitz muttered.
        Tapping at Kyle Field's door.
      -Only Josh Heupel and nothing more.

        Distinctly I remember, 1990 in December
        Another Heisman hopeful for the Crew to dismember.
        A crying Detmer mother in the stands; ESPN and many       Aggie fans
        Two dislocated shoulders and a 65-14 bore
        Still the most bowl points a team could score.
        -Twas Ty Detmer and nothing more.

        The media marvelled at a man named Bo
        #16 ranked Auburn's Heisman bro.
        In the Cotton Bowl the Crew stood tall
        4 downs later it was the Aggies' ball.
        A goal line stand for the world to adore
        A Jackie(S.) coming-out party as the Aggies roar.
        -Twas Bo Jackson and nothing more.

      Then Mr. Brown came beguiling
        With many Irish eyes a-smiling.
        His Heisman trophy aloft in the air,
        As was his towel after an Aggie dare.
        A 35-10 victory on the Cotton Bowl floor
        And Wrecking Crew dominance for many years more.
        -Twas Tim Brown and nothing more.

        Then came Houston's QB Ware
        Running and shooting thru humid air.
        He won the Heisman while at Cougar High,
        But the Crew took off his helmet and made him cry.
        Another conference championship in Aggie lore
        And another Heisman winner shown the door.
        -Twas Andre Ware and nothing more.

        To Kyle Field comes a Sooner Nation
        With a Big 12 South ring and national championship
expectation.
        Last year's loss the Wrecking Crew must avenge
        And the Aggie offense must prepare for revenge.
        Will Heupel audible without chore?
        Will #1 OU have a Heisman in store?
        -Quoth the 12th Man.... "Nevermore."

Breaking news:

Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis has just rejected a
court petition by Vice President Al Gore to force Florida to
accept hand recounted votes.  This ruling clears the way for
the Florida Division of Elections to certify the final vote
tally tomorrow.

That's great news -- but the post-election battle is not over
yet.

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on at this very
minute in Palm Beach and Broward counties.  If the ruling by
Judge Lewis stands, Florida's Division of Elections can
throw out these "hand counts."  But the Gore legal team is
appealing the decision today and it's very likely that the
Florida Supreme Court will be hearing the case shortly.

The Florida Supreme Court is comprised of six Democrats and
1 independent, and they've already ruled in Gore's favor to
allow the "hand counting" of ballots earlier this week.

Yes, this situation is still a mess.   That's why it's still
important for us to be mobilizing in favor of fair election
practices and integrity in the ballot counting process.  The
votes were counted on election day -- and George W. Bush won
Florida.  The votes were recounted in the days that followed
-- and George W. Bush won Florida.

Now the Democrats have hand picked a couple of counties
where they think they can manufacture enough votes to make
up the difference through "hand counting" of ballots.
What's worse is they're using ballot examining techniques
that amount to mind reading to determine whether or not
voters meant to vote for Al Gore.

Thank you for signing your Petition to block these
objectionable "hand counts" and Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  Every day we pick up more supporters (we're
closing in on 200,0000!) and every day we pick up more media
recognition as we swamp Florida with your Petitions.

Here's the bottom line: we are not going to let Al Gore
steal this election.   Send anyone and everyone who might be
interested in fighting for the integrity of this election to
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com to sign our petition
and see breaking news on the action in Florida right now.

Thanks,

I've seen those exact same quotes attributed to everyone from Bill Clinton to
Dan Quayle.  Seriously doubt that's credible.

Hi Folks,

Once again, we tap Mike McVay, our Meteorologist / Fantasy Football Fanatic
for some insights.  I know many of you have lineup deadlines today.  We'll
try to get one last update from Mike on Saturday.

Thanks Mike!

Joe




SEATTLE @ DENVER:  The latest on the potential for a snow storm in Denver
this weekend does look a little more promising for McCaffrey, Smith and
Frerotte owners.  The cold air and snow may hold off until after gametime.
Winds will be a concern and this forecast could go either way still, but the
trend is toward a Sunday night snow storm (as of Friday morning).  Frerotte
is likely the only "bubble" player listed above, but if you cannot wait
until late Saturday for the last update, I wouldn't be afraid to use him at
this point if he's your best option.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  This one still looks ugly.  Cold, windy and snow is
likely in Green Bay this weekend.  This is not a major snow storm and the
Packers (especially Favre) seem to thrive when it's nasty out.  Packer
players should be "ok", but if you have "bubble" players with Detroit, you
might want to consider another option.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  A cold rain is still in store for the
Chiefs/Panthers game at Arrowhead Stadium.  The Chiefs lack of a running
game could translate to turnovers favoring the Panthers.

 "Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, "What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?"  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  "Little Hitlers," they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, "Heil
Hitler" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those "littlest" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

Hi Folks,

As we head into your FF Playoffs, weather is a real factor in many games.
Knowing how it will affect your players can be huge.  With that in mind, I'm
pleased to introduce our Weather Guru, Mike McVay.  Mike's a Meteorologist
with WOWK - TV in West Virginia.  He also happens to be a very successful
Fantasy Football Fanatic.  What a deal.  Not unlike when I call on my
Physician friends for injury advice, Mike will offer his expert insights to
give you a sneak peek at how the weather may affect key games.

I'll see you early Thursday morning with our Matchups to Avoid and Exploit
and Players in the News.  In the meantime, here's an early look at some
developing weather situations that could affect your players this weekend.
Thanks Mike!



Joe




SEATTLE @ DENVER:  This one is worth monitoring.  The last game at Mile High
this year could get interesting.  A major snow storm will be brewing in the
Rockies on Sunday and heavy snow could cause problems for both the Seahawks
and Broncos.  Safest bets here are with the RBs.  What initially looks like
a high scoring game on paper, may actually become a ground game with a lot
of turnovers resulting in a low final score.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  More snow potential here.  Not a major storm, but
possibly enough to once again affect the passing game.  I'd shy away from
QBs and WRs if you have better options.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  This game will be ugly for the fans at Arrowhead. A
cold, steady rain with temps in the 30s for the start of this one.  The
Chiefs can't run the football, so this one could get interesting. Carolina's
Defense might actually be worth a gamble in this one.

CINCINNATI @ TENNESSEE:  Showers are likely throughout the game, but with
these two teams it shouldn't matter.  They both like running the football
anyway.

NEW ENGLAND @ CHICAGO:  I think the rain/snow will hold off until after game
time in this one.

PHILADELPHIA @ CLEVELAND:  Slight chance for rain/snow showers, but
shouldn't affect the game much.

TAMPA BAY @ MIAMI:  Slight chance for showers, but both of these teams are
used to this kind of weather.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 German was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is 
listed as probable for Sunday's game.  He was used as the third receiver 
earlier this season when Tim Dwight was sidelined with various injuries but 
has done little to push for extra playing time.  German has just one catch 
all season.     

 Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the 
Colts and the trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and Marvin Harrison.  
Their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling 25 sacks and 
allowing 216.3 yards per game.  They will need to apply a little more 
pressure on Indianapolis to contain Manning and Harrison.  Look for Green Bay 
to come at Manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough 
for them to have success against the Colts and their balanced attack.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia, and likely won't 
travel with the team on their trip to Philadelphia for this week's game 
against the Eagles. Jones has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners 
thus far, accounting for only 410 yards of total offense and two touchdowns 
this season.  

 David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/17/00 
 Sloan practiced Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game.  He is 
recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last week's game.  
Sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score  
a touchdown this season.    

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/17/00 
 With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the 
start this week against the Chiefs.  If Morris has been one of your main 
tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/17/00 
 Morris remains questionable for Sunday's game against the Chiefs with an 
ankle injury.  Head Coach Wade Phillips believes that Morris will be a 
game-time decision, so keep the Bills' rookie tailback on the bench this week 
if at all possible.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/17/00 
 Favre practiced Thursday and is expected to start Sunday's game at 
Indianapolis.  "The ball came out sharp," said offensive coordinator Tom 
Rossley.  "He was right on the money. I was pleased with what he did today."  
If Favre can stay in the game this Sunday he could have a big day.  The Colts 
have one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL, having allowed 15 TD passes 
this season.    

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/16/00 
 Sanders had his best game in five weeks last Sunday, catching five passes 
for 82 yards in Arizona's 31-14 loss to the Vikings. He is currently battling 
a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with 
the Eagles.  It would be a wise move to bench Sanders this week, especially 
against an aggressive Philadelphia secondary.   

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last Sunday against the 
Vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass.  In fact, "The Snake" has 
thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. Things won't get 
better for Plummer this week against the Eagles, who will blitz him 
relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions.    

 Troy Brown , WR NE - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Brown caught only two passes for ten yards last Sunday against the Browns.  
Although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, Brown is far too 
inconsistent to be considered a starter by most Fantasy league standards.  

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating 
back to Week Four against the Dolphins. With New England's offense sputtering 
in recent weeks, don't expect much from Vinatieri this week against the 
Bengals.    

 Rod Rutledge , TE NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last Sunday against the Browns, 
including his first career touchdown. With the release of Erich Bjornson, he 
should become more involved in the Patriots' offense in the coming weeks.  If 
you relied on Bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to 
pickup Rutledge.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/00 
 Pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. 
He has missed four of his last six games, but Coach Jeff Fisher says that he 
is improving. Pickens will likely be a gametime decision.  

 Bashir Yamini , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide 
receiver. One possibility is to sign Yamini, who is on the practice squad and 
was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace Chris Jackson, who will be 
out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. Jackson 
had recently been signed off the practice squad.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 George was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. He plans on 
getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough 
to play Sunday against Cleveland. The only real concern here is whether 
George may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. Keep a close eye on 
him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, Rodney Thomas.  

 Wade Richey , K SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal 
tries.  Last year Richey made 21-of-23 attempts.  He should get a lot of 
attempts this week against the Falcons.  San Francisco should be able to move 
the chains against Atlanta, but with Terrell Owens suffering from turf toe, 
The Niners will have problems scoring touchdowns.    

 Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Beasley missed last Sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries 
and remains questionable for this week.  Terry Jackson will start at fullback 
if Beasley is unable to play.  In the beginning of the season the Niners 
threw to Beasley in goal-line situations.  Recently they have chosen to let 
Charlie Garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts.   Beasley scored 
five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then.    

 Jerry Rice , WR SF - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/00 
 Rice sat out of practice Wednesday to rest his sore back.  He is expected to 
play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report.  Rice had five 
catches for 59 yards in the season opener against Atlanta.  At this point in 
his career Rice has very little Fantasy value.  He is being used mainly for 
routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations.    

 Chad Dukes , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 To add depth to its backfield, St. Louis has signed Dukes, who spent time on 
the Redskins' roster earlier this season.  Dukes will probably be the backup 
halfback against the Redskins Monday behind Justin Watson.  Regular backup 
Trung Canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist Sunday.   
 

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach Mike Martz said he 
will play against the Redksins Monday.  This week's matchup could be the 
ultimate test for the Rams' receiving team this week as they go up against 
one of the best secondaries in the league.  Start all of your Rams receivers 
as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle.    

 Andrew Glover , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Glover sat out practice Tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable 
for Sunday's game against the Raiders.  He may catch a lot of passes against 
his former team this week.  The Saints are thin on offense, with Ricky 
Williams and Jake Reed sidelined by injury, so Glover could get a lot of 
balls thrown his way.  The Raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes 
this season.  Denver TEs combined for 125 yards and a TD against them last 
week.  Kansas City TE Tony Gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against 
Oakland in Week 10.    

 Chris Hetherington , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career Sunday 
against the Vikings.  Hetherington will be filling in for the injured William 
Floyd who suffered broken ribs last week.  He is not as gifted offensively as 
Floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments.     

 Kris Mangum , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Mangum exited last Sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return 
due to a sprained shoulder.  Mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more 
flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at 
Minnesota.  "We'll see," Mangum told the Rock Hill Herald .  "I tried last 
week. I guess I came back a little early. We'll try again this week and see 
what happens."  Mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the 
injured Wesley Walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well.  
Rookie Casey Crawford will start at TE once again if Mangum is unable to play 
Sunday.        

 Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for 
a possible start against the Vikings Sunday.  Starter Tim Biakabutuka is 
suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at Minnesota.  At 
this point in the season selecting Hoover would be a gamble, even if he does 
start Sunday.  Carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 
79.4 yards per game.  It might be safer to use a starting back from another 
team even if the player hasn't been too productive.    

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Kitna was named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week yesterday after 
passing for three touchdowns in Seattle's 28-21 victory over Jacksonville.  
His reward?  A return to the bench, in all likelihood.  He is expected to be 
the backup to Brock Huard after the bye in a November 26th game against the 
Denver Broncos.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 Owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time 
in the team's 21-7 win over Kansas City.  Head coach Steve Mariucci is 
seriously considering holding Owens out of this week's game.  Owens still 
leads the NFL in TD receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf 
toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season.  If he can't play 
Sunday wideout J.J. Stokes would make his second straight start in place of 
him.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against Denver.  Head 
Coach Mike Riley stated earlier in the week that Jim Harbaugh would be the 
starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a 
decision.  Look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows 
it.    

 Jim Harbaugh , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Harbaugh was named the starter for Sunday's game against the Broncos earlier 
in the week, but Head Coach Mike Riley may now be retracting that statement.  
Ryan Leaf took an equal number of snaps as Harbaugh in practice on Wednesday, 
and may get the nod on Sunday.  Riley said that he plans to wait another day 
or two before announcing a starter.  If at all possible, go with another 
quarterback this week.     

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/00 
 Jacksonville will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson and Lonnie Marts, 
and probably without cornerback Aaron Beasley, for Sunday's game in 
Pittsburgh. Nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the 
last two recovering from knee surgery, went to California yesterday for a 
second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. Marts is still recovering 
from a groin injury, and Beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury 
but is unlikely to play. Rookie T.J. Slaughter, Erik Storz and Jason Craft 
would get the starts at their respective positions. Pittsburgh has a subpar 
passing game, but its running game, led by Jerome Bettis, could give the 
Jaguars' defense fits come Sunday.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/00 
 Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Saints.  He 
didn't play in Monday night's loss to the Broncos, and will be re-evaluated 
by Head Coach Jon Gruden during practice the rest of the week.  Oakland is 
reportedly talking about signing running back Terry Kirby for this week's 
game, which could be a bad sign if you have Wheatley on your Fantasy 
roster.

Agent Updated 12/07/00Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is=20
questionable for Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters=

Bryon Russell and Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid=

MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his right ring finger i=
n=20
Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined Wednesday.  He is=20
expected to play against the Wizards Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation=

Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting hand could lead to=

an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.    Terry Davis , F DEN -=

Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Davis will be eligible to come off the injured=
=20
list Sunday but Achilles tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep hi=
m=20
sidelined a little bit longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his=20
career and doesn't have much Fantasy value.    Antonio McDyess , F DEN - Th=

Rounders Updated 12/07/00McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday=

game against the Heat and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against th=

The leg is sore now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few=20
days.    Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00Hill may be ready to=
=20
return to the court for Thursday night's game against the Nuggets. He has=

missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he practiced on=20

Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will likely get him=

back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a four-game West Coast=

Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful that Trent will=

travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on the East Coast=
. =20
Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could be back in acti=

in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the first preseason game=

with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good inside scorer and a=
=20
solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return Fantasy owners=20
should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately need a forward. =

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00Marbury miss=
ed=20
his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an ankle injury. =
He=20
turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned it again the=20
following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is still lacking=
=20
some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle is=20
diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host the=
=20
Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their=
=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.  Vince Carter=
 ,=20
G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Carter was in uniform for Wednesday=
=20
night's game against Portland, but he didn't see any playing time. "Air=20
Canada" said that he felt well enough to play, but team doctors wouldn't gi=
ve=20
him permission to get in the game. "We'd like to have him back as soon as=
=20
possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, "but we're not going to bring him=
=20
back before he's ready." Toronto finishes their three-game West Coast swing=
=20
on Friday night against Golden State, at which time Carter hopes to make hi=
s=20
return. The Raptors' star should be back before Monday, so most Fantasy=20
owners can re-insert him into their lineup in time for next week.    Andre=

Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00Miller took a knee to the nos=
e=20
during Wednesday night's game at Chicago which sent him to the bench=20
temporarily. He returned to the game with a vengeance, finishing with 20=20
points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The sho=
t=20
to the nose won't keep Miller from missing any playing time, so continue to=
=20
use the young point guard in your starting lineup.    Elton Brand , F CHI -=
=20
Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Brand missed his second consecutive game on=
=20
Wednesday night against Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with hi=

hyperextended left knee, and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.=
 =20
Brand is listed as day to day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chan=
ce=20
of playing on Friday night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurri=

on Monday, Fantasy owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in the=
ir=20
lineup for next week's games.   Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated=
=20
12/06/00The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT sc=
an=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=

team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=

contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=

Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Dudley will travel with t=
he=20
Suns on their end of the week road-trip that starts in Milwaukee Thursday. =
=20
He will most likely be questionable for all the games.  Look for him to=20
finally return to action next week.  With Dudley out of the lineup Corie=20
Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to get playing time.  With=
=20
the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding makes him a starter on you=
r=20
Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his position.    Chris Mills , F=
=20
GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game=20
against the Lakers because of pain in his right ankle.  He was scheduled to=
=20
see a foot specialist on Tuesday and underwent surgery last season to remov=
e=20
bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills on your Fantasy bench for now.  If yo=
u=20
are playing in a small league drop him from your roster and add another=20
forward.     Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00Merc=
er=20
sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.  Corey=

Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status for=

this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your roster,=

if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The way Merc=

 =20
Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Williams sprained his=

Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably limit Williams'=20
production in the next few games so use a healthy forward instead.    Billy=

in=20
Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He has actually been productive this=20
season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.  Owens has been injury prone=

more durable player instead.     Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated=20
12/06/00Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He=
=20
scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the=

starting lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With a=

increased role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.    John=20
Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Wallace was placed on the=20
injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.  He is a good offensive=20

Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not 
provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an 
alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for 
non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts.  
The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result.

Dan,

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?


Thanks,

Eric

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 "What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask.
 "Only ten-to-twelve years," he replies, as if that's nothing.
 "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die." The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun
 control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands."

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

 WAKE UP AMERICA, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION.

=09?? Joe Rushing=20

=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown and his staff are not an in-your-face group of coach=

Players say that they are treated with respect. Make no mistake, they know=
=20
their jobs are on the line every day in practice. They know if they don't=
=20
perform in practice, they will be replaced. But SS Greg Brown said that Mac=
k=20
Brown has never given a "hell hath no fury" locker room talk, before, durin=
g=20
or after a game. Greg Brown said that Mack simply states what's on the line=
=20
for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate=20
themselves. Mack has said that as well. He said he asks players what works=
=20
for them best: whether it be the tough-love approach or the straightforward=
=20
approach. He has said constant yelling wears off. So he doesn't play head=
=20
games with his team. According to coaches and players from his time as OU=
=20
offensive coordinator back in 1984, Mack used to be a much more in-your-fac=
e=20
kind of coach, yelling at players to get them going. Coach Barry Switzer ha=
d=20
to tone him down. Brown said he has learned that you can't be negative with=

which of the potential signees, not orally committed, will most determine=
=20
where that rank ends up? Also, with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt ye=

and from what I am reading, an impressive one at that, what do you see in t=

future for Cedric Benson? What about the returning RBs such as Ivan William=

=20

er=20
the season?=20
=09?? Roy Cassas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Quarterbacks and linemen (on both sides of the ball) control th=
e=20
game, so you can never have enough of those positions. UT is filling its=20
needs nicely with the commitments that it has. The player that can probably=
=20
make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, perhaps th=
e=20
best defensive tackle in the country. UT's class is shaping up as a top 10=
=20
nationally, again. If Harris comes, it will climb. But as is the case with=
=20
all of this recruiting hype, it's just that - hype. Who knows if Cedric=20
Benson will play next year? He has to come down here in the heat of August=
=20
and prove to the coaches that he's better than Kenny Hayter, Ivan Williams,=
=20
Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran. I would say Benson's chances are good if som=

It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!

-Eric

Hi Folks,

Here's our first cut at the week 12 cheatsheet rankings.  As is the case
most every week, there are lots of questions still to be answered and these
rankings were based on the latest info and estimates for playing time and
availability.  As always, they'll be updated through the week here
http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm  as news breaks.

Good luck this week!

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $65,000           $113,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($95,000)
Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =       
$106,000
Accrual Value =                               $59,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $66,000           $119,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($100,000)
Total Value =                                   $172,000

Subject: Wellhead Accrual Income

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

You had to hit below the belt.  We were having a friendly shit talking 
contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.

What's up with that?

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

1. Short Math Quiz  (don't panic!)
---------------------------------
This is like an optical illusion....with numbers!
This riddle MUST be done in your head and NOT using
pen and paper.

Take 1000 and add 40 to it.
Now add another 1000.
Now add another 30. Another 1000.
Now add 20. Now add another 1000. Now add 10. What is the total?

We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek.  
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend 
delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of 
logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

 MESSAGE OF THE DAY:

 Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.
 Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown
BUT, it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap the
motherfucker upside the head.
