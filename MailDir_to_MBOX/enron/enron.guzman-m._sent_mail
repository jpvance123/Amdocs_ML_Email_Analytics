I will be down there earlier than that so just give me a call on my cell when 
you are coming down.  You might spend a lot of time in line if you go down 
that late dude.

Would you wanna go see a movie or have a few beers or something? I have to 
stay out late tonight so I can get used to the new nighttime schedule and if 
I just sit at home i will fall asleep.  I am going to try and stay up really 
late and then sleep really late tommorow morning to prepare.

OH MY GOD!  I WAS WITH SOME GIRL!?!?!???! WHAT A DICK I AM TO GET OVER YOU SO 
FAST!"  
That is pretty funny.   You know what is funny about that is that I was 
pretty sure she would call and tell you that.  What a dork! You know what, I 
am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town 
this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better.  
Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found 
out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and 
my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be 
there a week and maybe longer..  It is really hard to be sitting up here and 
not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I 
will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my 
grandmothers funeral.  My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I 
could be there for her.  She doesn't deal with loss very well.  
On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time 
energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am sooooo 
excited about it.  The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire 
fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.  It works three days on 
then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you 
get six days in a row off.  So in a month you get a ton more days off but, 
you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.  That part will 
be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.  But it 
also entails a raise of $4500 due to the hours so all in all it should be a 
positive move.  Anyway how is everything with you?

Yeah, I locked myself out of my house also.  really smart move!  I felt so 
terrible yesterday after our two nights of binge drinking.  I can't believe 
you stayed up partying until 6 in the morning.  You are CRAZY.  Hey did we 
make some sort of deal on those tickets.  I vaguely remember something to 
that effect.

Yeah dude I bet you got a lot of operational management and statistical 
business analysis as well as spreadsheet work with that Poli Sci degree.  At 
least the group projects will enable you to meet some people.  Are you still 
thinking about getting a job tending bar or something or do you think you 
won't have enough time?  good to hear you are coming up in a few weeks.  I 
would definetly like to go out with you guys on Thursday night. That Friday 
night i already have plans but maybe we can go play some golf on Friday 
afternoon.  I played in a tournament with some people at work out at the 
Reserve last week.  Boy is that a great course.  Our tee time was at 7:30 and 
we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.  So needless to say 
we weren't feeling so great come tee time. However the beers were free for 
the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a 
little better.  We all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42 
teams.  We won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a Nike bag.  There was 
a free bar-b-que afterward with more free beer.  So by about 2pm we were all 
totally schmatered.  It was a good time and I was playing with the guy that i 
want to work for in Real Time Trading.  He and I are going to lunch next week 
to discuss but he mentioned to me during golf that he wants me to work for 
him which would be a great opportunity so things are going a little better at 
work.  Anwyay let me know what your plans are for the week you come.  I will 
catch you later man.

Thanks sweetheart.  I am hanging in there as good as can be expected.  I was 
down there for two weeks and spent nearly all day every day with my sister 
and getting her moved to my moms and taking care of the funeral and all his 
bills and stuff.  It was a very hard two weeks but, I am doing okay.  I am 
more worried about my sister than anything else though.  She has my mom and 
stepdad though.  I felt bad leaving but my work had been so cool to give me 
two weeks of paid that I figured I shouldn't push it.  Anyway, I would love 
to go grab a beer with you sometime in the near future.  It is kind of nice 
just to go out and forget about things once in a while.  So how is everything 
with you?  You and Billy good?   Hows your family?  Let me know sometime if 
you want to grab a beer or lunch or coffee or something.

I don't know for sure if I am.  I am just in the "seriously thinking about 
it" stages.  However the fact that you are moving down there is definetly 
making me lean toward staying up here.  Tell your mom if you move and I stay 
she can adopt me.

Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the Blazer 
game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i ended up 
staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So basically my 
day is totally sucking.  How are you doing?

Thanks I so much appreciate the support.  Actually I just got back from LA 
today so sorry I didnt write back.  My father passed away a couple weeks ago 
and I have been down there taking care of everything for my sister.  It has 
been a rough month.  I will write back later in the week or maybe call you or 
something.  How is everything with you?

Dont worry about it.  I had a good time.  I don't really know what our plan 
is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my 
fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until 
after the game.  But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I 
can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us 
or if not we can meet up after the game or something.

Yeah dude I bet you got a lot of operational management and statistical

least the group projects will enable you to meet some people.  Are you still 
thinking about getting a job tending bar or something or do you think you 
won't have enough time?  good to hear you are coming up in a few weeks.  I 
would definetly like to go out with you guys on Thursday night. That Friday 
night i already have plans but maybe we can go play some golf on Friday 
afternoon.  I played in a tournament with some people at work out at the 
Reserve last week.  Boy is that a great course.  Our tee time was at 7:30 and 
we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.  So needless to say 
we weren't feeling so great come tee time. However the beers were free for 
the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a 
little better.  We all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42 
teams.  We won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a Nike bag.  There was 
a free bar-b-que afterward with more free beer.  So by about 2pm we were all 
totally schmatered.  It was a good time and I was playing with the guy that i 
want to work for in Real Time Trading.  He and I are going to lunch next week 
to discuss but he mentioned to me during golf that he wants me to work for 
him which would be a great opportunity so things are going a little better at 
work.  Anwyay let me know what your plans are for the week you come.  I will 
catch you later man.

Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do 
something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads 
insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would 
be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't 
still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating 
dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back.

hey you.! yeah, sorry about the late night call.  Jay, TJ, Scott, Chrissy, 
and Nicole and I were out pretty late that night and then came back to my 
house for a hot tub. We got really drunk becuase earlier in the night Scott 
got his Porsche impounded for basically no reason and we were bummed becasue 
we were on our way to this really cool club.  Well anyway, Jay was asking me 
how you were doing and I was drunk so I gave you a call.  Vegas was 
absolutely out of control!  We all decided on the way home that it was by far 
the craziest Vegas weekend any of us had ever been on.  It ended up being me, 
Jay, TJ, and Brendan.  Jimmy and Kato didn't come.  Anyway, TJ's girlfriend 
Jessica and some of her friends came out on Saturday.  We all went out to a 
nice dinner then gambled for a while and then went to some dance club where 
we proceeded to get in two fights because some dudes were hitting on 
Jessica.  We got kicked out of the club at the Luxor.   TJ got hit pretty bad 
and ended up with a black eye, Jay got his tooth chiped and I got sucker 
punched on the side of my head by some guy that was smaller than Jay.  And 
that was the mellow part of the evening.! It got even crazier after that as 
TJ, Jessica , Alisha, and I ended up staying up until 6am.  Then we went and 
hung out in their room at the Luxor for a couple hours. then went back 
downstairs and started partying again!  Meanwhile we couldn't find Jay and 
Brendan anywhere and we were really worried that they might be in Jail.  
Finally they called us at around 8am from some strip club. Anyway,  I have a 
ton more stories but this mail is getting too long.  How has everything been 
with you? Fill me in.  Oh,  I was going to buy a new TV anyway, so I was 
thinking why, don't we just trade our TV's back and you can use the $$$ to 
buy yourself a VCR or something.

So, you are really serious about this then huh?  I thought you were just 
thinking about it.  So where were you thinking of living? Have you discussed 
it with your family.  How much would they have to offer you in order for you 
to move and what kind of time frame are you thinking about.  What do you 
think daves reaction will be?

So what the hell is Kims problem.  You have been telling her for months that 
you were going to move out.  What a bitch.  Regarding the Nicole thing it 
really isn't that big of a deal anyway.  When I am down there we go out but 
it's not like we are together or anything.  I wouldn't let them hassle me 
affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick 
of hearing about it all the time.  Nicole is awesome and I like dating her 
while I am down there.  It is just a wierd situation.   About the moving to 
LA thing it really is a job issue at this point.  It will be hard to find a 
job as good as the one that I currently have and that is going to be the real 
issue.

That sounds good to me.  Would it be to late for you to go to the 9 o clock 
movie.  I have some errands to run this evening in your area so, i could just 
cruise over to your house around 7:00 or so and we could grab a bite to eat 
and then hit a movie.  Until i get up to speed I will be working three nights 
on (6pm-6am) then two days off then three nights on.  I think my third or 
fourth week I will start working some days and work a little less.  Like 
three nights followed by  three days iff  followed by three days on.  I will 
have a schedule in advance for a month.  It looks like I should get two 
weekends off a month and then several weekdays off.  It is kind of messed up 
but it is such an awesome opportunity and i am really excited.

Jesse, this has been done.  I called APS to confirm that they show this 
however they said they were to busy and they would call me back.  As of this 
email they have not yet called me back.  They seemed a  little perturbed that 
I was calling about 1 MW.

Angela was pissed at a lot of things.  She was mad that we didn't invite her 
because it was guys weekend but then we ended up hanging out with Jessica and 
her friends.  The stupid thing was that she yelled at me!   She was really 
mad that I was hanging out with this Alisha girl most of the weekend.  I dont 
get it.  I got soo mad at her.  I went off on her about how everytime I hang 
out with any chicks she gets pissed and it is none of her fucking business 
what I do.  She said she was mad because I hung out with chicks in Vegas with 
Jay.  The stupid thing is that Jay didn't even dance with any chicks or 
anything.  He was on way good behavior.  I completely melted down on her and 
I told her she needed to go get counseling.  
The love life is off and on right now. I have been seeing Nicole when I go 
down to LA however, I think between all the shit her and I get from Jay, my 
sister, and Chrissy, it really isnt worth the hassle and has kind of made it 
a little uncomfortable.  I did meet that Alisha girl and hooked up with her a 
little this weekend.  She is really cool and she is totally someone I would 
date, if I lived in LA.  We really clicked.  I am going down there next 
weekend so maybe I will hang out with her instead of Nicole.  I don't know.  
The Nicole thing with my sister and Jay and Chrissy really pissed me off 
bad.   
As far as girls up here my love life is pretty non existant.  There is this 
girl from work that I really like and we hang out a lot but nothing much has 
really happened yet.  I am really never here very much anymore.  Anytime I 
have breaks from work I have been going to LA.  I have been sending some 
resumes around down there and I am pretty seriously considering moving back.  
I am just kind of bored with Portland and there really isn't a lot for me 
here.  You never really talked about whats going on with you these days?

Kim, who do you think you are fooling?  A drink or two?  Really?!?!  I think 
I have heard that one from you before.  I don't even say shit like that 
anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I 
would have had I just kept my mouth shut.  But in respect for your new job we 
will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early!  :)  See ya soon!

I just wasnt sure what we were doing thats all.  Yes if the Beavs go I will 
go if i have the day off but it is not likely they will.  We have to beat the 
ducks which is reasonable but UW has to lose which is not likely.  Likely we 
will go to the holliday or sun bowls.

I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the 
day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a 
deal to me.  The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to 
go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about 
going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it 
would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right 
now.  So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating 
other people?

No but I am getting the opportunity to trade by taking this position.  It is 
an awesome position in that I will learn virtually every aspect of this 
business and get and trade daily energy.  It is definetly a step up from my 
current position.

Carla, this doesn't make much sense to me that we would both randomly add a 
sunday to block forward deals.  I looked both of them up and it appears that 
they were both index forward transactions and both were entered on the smae 
day.  Therefore it would appear that there may have been a problem with the 
masks?

There were two Block Forward deals in for Sunday on Peak.  I looked in the 
Block Forward log and did not see them being different from a straight on 
peak deal.  Therefore I changed the masks to exclude Sundays and Holidays.  
One was put in by Carla and the other by Mark. Here are the deal numbers 
#403599, and 403603.  If you have any questions let me know.

Hey kiddo.  I didn't get in until last night.  My weekend went allright. Most 
of it was filled with family stuff.  Saturday night I just hung out with my 
dad and watched the beavs game on tv.  I did go out to Hollywood with some 
friends on Sunday night however. It was a friend of mines birthday so we went 
over to his house and then to this club in Hollywood.  It  was  a good time 
however, pretty mellow.  I went with my friends Chrissy and Allison and they 
both had to work on Monday so we left at around midnight.  It was okay with 
me however, as I really wasnt that into partying anyway.
Oh yeah, I got that job.  I think I start tommorow night which means I will 
be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but I am 
really looking forward to this new position.  How did your weekend go?  Any 
exciting stories?

Harbor Cogen called this on Monday night shift at approximately HE 24 stating 
that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack 
in an oil supply line.  Mike at Harbor stated that we should not bid in day 
ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may 
take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power 
to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night 
shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on 
Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for 
your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please 
call me on my cell 702-0463

18:59 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ US Energy Secretary Warns Pwr Producers In
West On Prices
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--As California's electricity system teeters on the
brink of collapse, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson warned power
producers not to attempt to take advantage of the power-supply crisis.
"I am very concerned about the condition of power markets in the West.
Electricity supplies in parts of the region are tight and prices charged for
wholesale power in the region continue to spiral out of control," Richardson
said in a press release late Monday.
Richardson urged power providers not to attempt to take advantage of the
crisis by price gouging.
"While I have no specific knowledge of any such activities, it is important
that generators located throughout the region and in Canada and Mexico
understand that the administration won't tolerate any actions designed to
take advantage of the situation," Richardson said.
The energy secretary criticized a decision by Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (KLU) to
shut down an aluminum smelter in the Pacific Northwest that receives
low-cost power from the Bonneville Power Administration and resell that
power in open markets for a profit of $52 million.
"I have instructed Bonneville to explore all necessary actions to prevent
Kaiser from remarketing this power," Richardson said.

I don't even know Dave so I wouldn't judge him.  I just worry about you being 
with someone that has a bad temper like that.  You know eventually that 
temper might be aimed at you.  I know you can take care of yourself and I am 
sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't 
mean I can't worry about ya.  :)   So I didn't go anywhere last night.  I am 
feeling pretty sick and Burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in 
until about 12 last night.  I haven't talked to him yet today and last time I 
talked to him i told him I had plans tonight which have been changed.  I 
would like to go out with him but I don't really feel like drinking and I am 
really trying to cut back on it.  This thing with my dad has really scared me 
about drinking and bieng more healthy.  I am not pretending that I am going 
to stop drinking I just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on 
it.  There is no need for me to get as drunk as I did last weekend.  Boy is 
that a great story! If I do go out with Burns tonight should I call you?

Bill, per our conversation last night I phoned PAC to see if they could put 
in the disputed Idaho deal.  They stated that they could not do that.  They 
were very nice about it an stated that they have problems with Idaho quite 
often but they had to turn away several customers during that hour and would 
not be able to add our schedule.  I have deleted the deals from enpower and I 
have deleted them from the El Paso sheet however, I did not do a final 
checkout with Idaho Power for those hours in case we have any further 
recourse on this issue.  Thank you for your help in this matter and please 
let me know what you need me to do to further resolve this issue.

So, I saw Kristen last night.  I was on my way to dinner with my friend Kim 
and Kristen was sitting outside at the 21st ave Bar and Grill.  She acted 
like I was her long lost friend and then proceeded to ask about the night in 
Long Beach.  She said hey, I have no hard feelings over what happended to 
which I didn't respond and then she said "what happened that night?"  "All i 
really remember was Katie throwing a chair at me"  I said " I don't want to 
talk about it Kristen"  and we walked off.  My friend Kim thought I was being 
very rude.   She asked me why I was so rude to someone that appeared to be so 
nice.  So I had to tell the whole story over dinner.  I was once again 
completely shocked.  All I could do was laugh.

yeah I found out later in the week that you guys were gone.  Sounds like you 
had a great time!   I love Italy.  that place is so awesome.  I was over 
there about the same time of year in 93 and it was great because there was 
less tourists and it was a little cheaper but the weather was still pretty 
good.  You will have to tell me about it next time I see you.  So I am going 
down to the Beaver game on Saturday but i might go down to Eugene and hang 
out with Wilson tommorow night.  I will probably decide tonight but if I 
don't I would be into grabbing a few beers with you tommorow night after 
work.

Les, we were unable to find power at a reasonable rate for the  HE 5 2MW 
schedule so we therefore we just didn't show up in the PX for that hour.  The 
only offer we recieved was for $225 which I felt was too steep to pay.  It 
turned out well however as the PX price was $120 and there was no cong at 
Mead so we saved them a little money by not buying the $225.  Just thought I 
would let you know.

I assume when you say sick you were refering to Angelas friend.  If so, then 
no I didn't even touch her.  Angela actuall hates Nicole she says she is a 
"fat ho".  I have a very good story to tell you about what happened.

Yeah, I think I left a bunch of shit in those cupboards that night.  I miss 
that apartment to because it was so nice however, I love where I live now.  I 
never leave downtown anymore.   I only go out to places downtown pretty much 
and I don't have to drive if I want to go out for a few drinks.  I love 
northwest.  So how is it working out with the Kim thing.  Are you going to 
move out soon?  
As far as working nights goes the first night went fine and I was not even 
tired.  I am working tonight and Saturday night also.  I have next weekend 
off which will be nice.  Once I am up to speed I wont have to work nights. i 
will be working half the time nights and half the time days, so that will be 
a little better.  And it will be awesome to have a six day break once a

I am probably not going to make it.  A) I am feeling sick.  B) Burns is in 
town and if I am feeling better I wanted to hang out with him.

Jubran, I need to know what dates these deals were done. Your spreadsheet 
does not say and scheduling wants to know what date to backdate it to.  They 
have also said that they would like to see the deal ticket as I had asked 
before however, am I correct in assuming that since these deals had to do 
with the purchase of PG&E  that you might not have a deal ticket on your 
end?  I already had the spreadsheet, however, they were asking for additional 
information and since Diana was out I got kind of thrown in the middle of 
this one.  Thank you for your help.  Have a great weekend.

Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning 
and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so.  I will probably just go to 
Jorge's and crash out until you arrive.  Have you guys made any plans for 
Saturday night?  I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even 
coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us.  We actually 
talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be 
intereseted in doing  that.

that kind of temper around you.  Anyway its really none of my business i

Thats cool dude.  Sorry we missed you too.  We had a fun time on Saturday 
night.  Friday i took my sister to the blazer game.  She had a really good 
time.  Anyway, I have a 200 level seat behind the basket for game three of 
the playoffs do you want to go?  It is a $76 ticket.  I may be able to get 
game 4 (if neccesary) also if you are interested.  Let me know. It should be 
either the 25th or 26th.

This is a good deal based on what I have discussed with the trader and based 
on the EES ticket so I will go ahead and input and then backdate the 
transaction

I have a problem,  I just accepted a new position at my work.  The hours are 
really fucked up and are kind of like fireman hours where I have to work some 
night shifts and weekends but get several days of in a row afterward.  I 
won't find out my schedule for the month until next week so there is a 
possibility that I may not be able to go if i am scheduled to work that 
weekend.  I realize I will get some shit for this but at least I am not using 
the OPERA EXCUSE.  I will let you guys know as soon as I get my new schedule 
but, if I am off on that weekend i am definetly in.   
Memo to Jones:  You HAVE to come up with some better excuses if you don't 
want to get hazed.  The Opera!  REALLY GUY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?

Hey, I told everybody to leave the first two weekends in November open, then
I asked what your preference might be.  Hsu was the only one who gave a
preference.  Macy's birthday is the first weekend.  Why is this the first
time you decided to mention the friggin opera.  Give a ticket to Cindy or
whoever and nut up and go bag a bull.

Group,

Yesterday 11 /11 and this morning  11/12  the ISO cut one of our schedules 
where Enron was exporting from SP 15, to NOb more specifically the schedule 
looks like this: CISO-EPMI-SCL. Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and 
forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL  all the OTHER 
nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris 
Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path. 

As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one 
of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure  and ask the ISO that the other 
nonfirm  schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut. 

For any further questions on this matter contact Sean Crandall or Chris 
MAllory

thanks
Monika

I was planning on going down relatively early on Saturday morning with Sul 
and Sheffler.  I would like to leave around 9:00 and go down and have 
breakfast and a few beers at the peacock as a good friend of mine owns it now 
and I would like to see him and what he has done to the place.  You are more 
than welcome to come with us if you like.

Bill, I would really like to sign up for the derivatives course being offered 
on June 4th and 5th.  I had already requested the 1st thru the 5th off in 
order to attend a wedding in LA however, I would like to attend the course 
and if selected would cut my trip short.  Let me know.  Thank you.

Rick, what are you doing for tommorow.  I would love to go out early before 
it gets to crowded and then maybe go somewhere a little more mellow later in 
the afternoon/evening.  Also, are you guys doing anything this evening? Let 
me know.

Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business 
degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance.  He is a pretty bright kid 
and wants to pursue a carrer in finance.   I actually talked to him about it 
at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested.  
.  He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I 
think would fit in well here if given the opportunity.  I dont know about 
your feelings on hiring guys right out of college.  I know we had done so in 
the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that.  Let me know.

On November 8th begining at HE 8 Tosco informed Real time that they were 
going off the grid with no return ETA.   They were scheduled in correctly for 
the day ahead at 7 MW.  We were able to take out hours 11-24 however, hours 
8-10 we were short ex-post by the 7 MW.  Toscos schedule was zeroed out by 
decing short term cali load in PGE 3 per Jeff Richter.  Note to real time 
night shift.  Tosco may be coming back on line completely but as of yet they 
have not  called back to notify when that may be.  Please contact me or 
Jeremy with any questions.

What up foolio?  Just thought I would drop you a line and see how things are 
going in the city by the bay.  Got your address from Sul at Monday nights 
softball game.  Which we won.  We haven't lost in this section of the fall 
league and are playing really good ball.  Maybe it is our upgrade at first 
base.  So I am still not sure if I will be able to come down for the Cal game 
or not. Right now I am kind of broke from all the flights to LA.  I went and 
had a few beers with Cheryl last night.  She called me up about 8:00 and I 
was bored so I decided to go with her.  She got so fucking ass faced.  Man 
that chick is a train wreck sometimes.  So how is school?  What kind of 
classes are you taking right now?   You aren't going to convert into being a 
Giants fan while you are down there are you?  Anyway drop me a line when you 
get a chance and let me know how everything is going.  Oh by the way:  Beavs 
update "  We Suck!"

John, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to discuss with me the 
opportunity available in the Real Time Group.  Based on our discussion and 
after further consideration I feel that it would be an excellent fit for both 
the Real Time Group and myself. With my prior and current work experience and 
knowledge of the enpower system,    I am confident that I will be a valuable 
asset to your team.  I look forward to the opportunity and eagerly await your 
positive response.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or 
concerns you may have.  Once again thank you for the opportunity.

I said you cant just take away the dinner offer.  I wanted to go to dinner 
but if you thought it was going to be a big issue between you and Dave I 
didn't want to cause a fight between you two or something.

Yeah she is a freak. She totally acted like I was her best friend or 
something!  give me a break if I wasn't with someone I would have totally 
went off on her.  I actually didn't watch the game as i was at the OSU game. 
We went to the peacock and drank some beers with Carter (who owns it now)  We 
partied most of the morning and then went to the game.  Then a bunch of us 
went down to Eugene and partied and i stayed the night at Wilson and Cindys.  
Deidre and Stephan were there too.  It was really fun.  Sunday sucked cause i 
was really hung over and had to be up to portland by noon to play golf with 
kim but a few beers on the course and I felt great.  Speaking of you picking 
up on chicks Amanda told me a pretty interesting story last week of you 
trying to pick up on her a couple of times.  So lets see, do I have any 
friends (male or female) that you didn't try to pick up on while we were 
dating! :)    Frankly I was very  embarassed when she told me. VERY NICE 
Katie!   Good thing Dave is a good sport.  I did see the articles about 
capital consultants.  Grayson  is lucky he isn't wearing a set of cement 
sneakers on the bottom of the Willamete for screwing around with union money 
like that!  That is too bad you dont hang out with your friends anymore.  How 
come you havent kept in touch?  Why dont you call them.

I switch back and forth from night to day shifts it depends on the week.  I 
have been working day shifts this week.  I would say I would like to watch 
the game but I am actually going to the game.  What about a beer later in the 
week or this weekend.  I think Johnson might be in town soon, I reecieved an 
email from him this week.

Jesse, per my email to Bill last week I need to take March 31st thru April 3

Bill, for approximately 2 and a half hours on (2:20-5:00am MST)  the scrape 
was completely down.  There was no access to it at all.  To maintain the 
model and also to properly run the units i maintained 15 minute verbal 
contacts with Generation, and updated the scrape based on the numbers that 
they gave me.  The numbers appeared good and there were no problems for those 
hours.  Apparently this also happened to Holden earlier on 12/23.  I also had 
one hour on 12/23 (HE 24) that was not working correctly either.  Thought I 
should let you know.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Dude I hear you are going to be in town this weekend.  Unfortunately I will 
be gone, I am going to SF to hang with Burnsy as i have a six day break from 
work.  I will however, be back in town on Sunday night.  If you are going to 
be in town  still maybe we could grab a beer late sunday night (I don't get 
in until 10) or grab lunch on Monday as I don't work monday.  Give me a call 
on my cell and let me know.  Oh, by the way i will be going out with the one

the country for a month.  If you want to have a chat with the man give us a 
call that night 503-702-0463.  Take care buddy and happy holidays!  Oh yeah,

Hey Tyson.  Are you guys doing anything after the game?  I think Ben Pacewic, 
Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys 
are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to 
stop by before the game.  I know I would like to come by the house and see 
how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you 
guys have anything going on Saturday night.

Whats up lil' Kirky.  Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone 
just died or something.  I am so excited to come down there and hang out in 
the city.  I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to 
go check things out.  That would be awesome if you could come into town on 
Wednesday or Thursday night.  Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks.  I 
called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was 
going to be in town.  Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I 
did the weekend of Wilsons wedding.  I think my body is still recovering from 
all those shenanigans.  Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next 
week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday.  Look 
forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care!

Bill,  I have some family business that I need to attend to in April.  I 
therefore need, March 31st thru April 3rd off from work.  It is only four 
days so I assume it will not be a problem.  I already have March 31st off so 
if you could just make sure that I have April 1st  thru 3rd off also it would 
be greatly appreciated.  I am going to book my ticket tommorow evening to 
take advantage of a good fare so please let me know if there is a problem by 
then.  Thanks.

Yo baby whats up?  Thanks for hanging out with me on Monday night.  I had a 
really good time (even if you were preoccupied with the Dave thing).  I hope 
all is going well for you.  I am actually working a day shift which is pretty 
cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.  So, what do you 
have going for the rest of the week?  I have a work function tonight.  One of 
my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at 
the Lucky Lab in southeast.    I got a call from my date from hell.  
Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.  I don't 
want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is 
going to last too late.  Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you 
excited about your party this weekend?  I went and bought a couple dress 
shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up 
spending $184 !  Just on two shirts and a tie.  I should just refrain from 
even going to that store.  Check ya later sweetie!

Portland actually becomes a happening town for one day a year and that day is 
St Patricks Day.  There are several pretty cool places that we can go 
downtown that will be having pretty decent sized parties.   What is your 
schedule for the weekend?  I have Thursday off, work Friday, Have Saturday 
off and work Sunday, howe-ver, I think I have someone to work for me on 
Sunday.  Anyway, let me know your plans, here is my phone number in case Dahl 
doesn't have it.  Home  503-228-7767   Cell 503-702-0463.  Lets grab some 
green beers!

Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me.  I mean what the fuck did he do 
that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared 
seeing him act like that.  Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show 
that kind of temper around you.  Anyway its really none of my business i 
guess.  I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to 
my mother.  I hope you feel better.

okay so it's 2:30 am and I am so ready to be out of here it is ridiculous.  I 
am so excited to come down there and have some fun and just forget about work 
and all the other lame ass shit that has been going on in my life.  Anyway 
looking forward to seeing you and here is Burnsy's cell phone number 
415-710-3410.   Also remember if you don't want to drive home that night or 
take the Bart home (you taking the bart home alone scares me) you are more 
than welcome to crash at Burnsys house on Thursday night.  He has a pull out 
bed and told me to tell you you are more than welcome to crash there.  I will 
catch up with ya tommorow and we will figure out what to do Thursday night.

Hey Dave.  Hope your weekend went well with the girls.  I got a call from my 
mom tonight that Cita was in the Hospital again.  According to my mom she is 
doing okay now.  I called Cita on Friday and she said she just felt like she 
was getting a cold but apparently she went in for the heart failure thing 
again?  Is that correct.?  Anyway,  I am working the night shift tonight so I 
will give her a call tommorow afternoon after I wake up.   I called and left 
you a message letting you know that i am probably not going to Vegas.  
Everyone kind of flaked out.  So, I will be around the weekend of the Super 
Bowl and was wondering what you guys might be doing for it.  Also I was going 
to see if you and Karen would maybe be interested in going up to Big Bear to 
go skiing for the day on Friday or Saturday.  I thought it might be fun.  I 
have an extra set of ski's that I was thinking about bringing and leaving  
down there anyway so I could go without having to hassle with Rentals.  So, 
let me know if you have any interest in doing that and if you have anything 
going for the Super Bowl.  Tell Cita I love her and tell Bob to get in 
shape!  See ya soon!

Well, sorry to hear your weekend sucked so bad.  Mine was pretty awesome.  I 
was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since 
Burns was in town I just didn't drink.  On Friday night a bunch of us met up 
with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.  We hung out there for a while and then 
went to the Gypsy.  I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and 
didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.  Then on Saturday 
Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.  We 
went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.  Burnsy, Sul, 
Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.  I felt like a big 
babysitter being the only sober one.  The game was awesome and everyone but 
me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.  Sunday I was still feeling 
sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged 
at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.  For being sick 
and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great 
time.  I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday 
becuase I started having some bad asthma.  T  Everything else is going okay I 
guess.  I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and 
then on Friday I leave for LA .  So anyway, hope your week is going a little 
better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.  Were you 
and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else?

That was the absolutely one of the stupidest jokes I have ever heard.  Maybe 
you guys should put down your bongs for a minute and try to come up with 
something a little better than that.  GO BEAVS!

Okay, did you email Katie and tell her we hung out last night because 
remarkably she emailed me this morning asking me how I was doing and how my 
family is.  It just seemed to coincidental.  I dont care if you did I was 
just curious.

Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack 
of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway.  However, I don't 
really know the dynamic in your relationship at all.  

So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left on 
Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left.  I feel so bad leaving her. She 
is really broken hearted right now.

Subject: DJ US Southwest Pwr Mkt Rises On Unit Outage, CalPX Chaos


17:13 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ US Southwest Pwr Mkt Rises On Unit Outage,
CalPX Chaos
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Prices for prescheduled power in the southwestern U.S.
rose Tuesday due to a unit outage and uncertainty about the market rules of
the California Power Exchange, traders said.
The 498-megawatt San Juan coal-fired unit 4 in New Mexico tripped off the
grid Monday due to a tube leak, but it is expected back on line Tuesday
night.
Traders also said total uncertainty about the market rules in California
have thrown the market into chaos. On Sunday, the California Power Exchange
cleared power sales at prices above $250/MWh because the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approved an emergency request from the California
Independent System Operator to move to a new "soft" price cap.
The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than $250 a
megawatt-hour, so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on
costs to justify the high price. In time, the FERC could reduce prices for
any sales above $250/MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable, according
to the "soft" cap rules originally proposed by FERC.
The CalPX says that its day-ahead market has also moved to the soft price
cap, but the ISO on Sunday constrained almost all CalPX prices for Monday
down to $250/MWh, from an average of $611.53/MWh. The ISO staff and middle
managers apparently don't believe the new soft-cap applies to the CalPX
market, though late Monday the ISO constrained some prices for Tuesday down
to $250-$500/MWh but left the CalPX clearing prices for nine hours unchanged
at $926.34-$1,020.99/MWh.
Traders said Tuesday that no ISO constrained pricing formula comes up with
even figures as $280/MWh and $500/MWh, and that somebody at the ISO is just
making up prices arbitrarily.
With all the uncertainty about what final prices will be, suppliers avoided
the CalPX market Monday and Tuesday. With fewer sell offers and steady
demand, the CalPX has risen sharply higher than the bilateral market. The
much-higher CalPX clearing prices Monday, in turn, pushed the southwest
bilateral market higher early Tuesday, traders said

               On-Peak/MWh          1 Day Previous
Palo Verde    $  400.00-$  520.00  $  300.00-$  375.00
Mid-Columbia     650.00-   850.00     750.00- 1,000.00
COB              600.00-   800.00     700.00-   900.00

After the bilateral market completed most of its trading, the CalPX posted
Wednesday on-peak clearing prices that averaged $1,406.76/MWh, up $417. How
the ISO may change those prices later Tuesday is unknown. The CalPX made an
emergency filing late Monday with the FERC to include its market in the new
"soft" cap rules.

am probably going to have to work late to help out on a project.  I will let

there tonight.  sorry man.

Well, I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know Dave and all I 
really know is what you have told me which is that he has a bad temper and 
appears to have an alcohol problem.  I am sure he must be a good guy if you 
have been dating him this long though. Speaking of alcohol I have kind of 
come to a realization recently that I need to cut down on my own drinking.  
That is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend. I am not going to 
stop going out for a few beers but, I am just tired of how I feel the next 
day and just laying around and shit.  And the thing with my dad has really 
scared me into being more  healthy.  Although it doesn't seem to really show 
to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and I just don't want to 
be my Dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is 
havning right now.  

I think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you 
think you have a big enough future with Dave to go through with trying to 
help him with the problem. If you think you do and the drinking thing is an 
issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but  if you 
don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away.   Good luck and 
if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me.

Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model.  
When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking 
with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told 
him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their 
number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony,  
and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when 
he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to 
this matter.

18:59 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ US Energy Secretary Warns Pwr Producers In
West On Prices
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--As California's electricity system teeters on the
brink of collapse, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson warned power
producers not to attempt to take advantage of the power-supply crisis.
"I am very concerned about the condition of power markets in the West.
Electricity supplies in parts of the region are tight and prices charged for
wholesale power in the region continue to spiral out of control," Richardson
said in a press release late Monday.
Richardson urged power providers not to attempt to take advantage of the
crisis by price gouging.
"While I have no specific knowledge of any such activities, it is important
that generators located throughout the region and in Canada and Mexico
understand that the administration won't tolerate any actions designed to
take advantage of the situation," Richardson said.
The energy secretary criticized a decision by Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (KLU) to
shut down an aluminum smelter in the Pacific Northwest that receives
low-cost power from the Bonneville Power Administration and resell that
power in open markets for a profit of $52 million.
"I have instructed Bonneville to explore all necessary actions to prevent
Kaiser from remarketing this power," Richardson said.

We have not heard back from Carla about her jury duty and whether it will 
continue through tommorow.  Therefore could you inform your group to continue 
sending the deal correction e mails to me until further notice.  Thank you

I forgot to tell you this.  I had a dream a few weeks ago that you called me 
and said you and Dave were getting married.  Anyway, I was congratulating you 
and you said that to raise money for the wedding you were going to strip for 
a couple months and that I should bring my friends down so you would make 
some extra cash.  So I did and went down there to help you out but got so 
wierded out by the whole thing that I left.  I don't know why i just 
remembered that but I thought you would think it was funny.

I feel bad but she understands.  I think she might come up and be with me for 
thanksgiving.  I have a six day break right around then and I think it would 
be good for her to just get away for a while.   
Guess what?  I had a couple of dates while I was in LA.  They went very well 
and she might come up in December for a weekend!

Bill, over the past few weeks we have had quite a few occasions that El Paso 
has had problems checking out with other control areas due to them providing 
transmission for other counter parties.  Last night and on several other 
nights the generation guys at El Paso have been netting out generation 
schedules with transmission schedules.  On several occasions,including last 
night,  myself or other members of team have identified this problem for them 
and have told them not too net the schedules.  However, last night, and on 
other nights,  for several hours we were 15MW off because they netted a 
schedule.  Bert, I and other group members have tried to assist them with 
this issue however, it is becoming a consistent problem and i feel that 
someone may want to mention it to Roger, Steve, or Tony.   I have tried to 
address this with generation myself on several occassions however, the 
problem has become reoccuring.n  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am doing pretty good.  I have been really busy lately.  And the work 
situation should be resolved sometime next week as I am interviewing for two 
other internal positions on the trading desk.  Family is okay I guess. Dad is 
not doing well at all and was almost checked into the hospital yesterday.  
Angela is really really worried about him and we talk just about everyday.  I 
am in the process of getting the documents for power of attorney in case 
anything happens to him and he is incapacitated or something.  I had a very 
interesting weekend last weekend.  Just a whole bunch of crazy shit 
happened.  It was all fun stuff though.  How about you?

well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at 
the last minute.  I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was 
pretty cool.  I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these 
girls that I met there until about 5 am.  I talked to Burns a few days ago 
and I guess he is still seeing that chick.  I didn't ask about the living 
situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down 
there.  So anyway how was your New Year.?  How did everything go with Ricky?  
I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something!  Anyway I 
gotta run.  Talk to you later!

Well I bet your family just feels like I was saying the other night.  That 
you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully 
you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just 
$35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take 
would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been 
persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you 
services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have 
got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your 
office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in 
the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never 
ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North 
Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and 
pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very 
reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if 
Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay?

Just little things like I should be resolving my job situation by the end of 
next week and some other little stuff that has made me happy and a little 
more confident about stuff.  Nothing too major. After how things went the 
last few months it doesn't take much!

Bill, FYI.  You have both David Porter and me working on that day shift.  
Either we need to let the night shift know that they need to come in an hour 
and a half early, put someone else on that day shift, or change the 
itenerary.  Let me know when you have this resolved.  Thank you for your 
attention to this matter.

Les, on 12/24 I input the Willamette transaction as usual however I could not 
get the deal number 471943 (transmission piece we have been using) to extend 
to this day.  Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one 
transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission 
price.  I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be 
handled.  I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix 
the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly 
appreciated.  Also if you could let me know what was done for future 
reference.  Thanks,  Merry x-mas and Happy New Year!

Hey, since I hear you are doing the schedule now after all could you please 
remember to have me not working March 31st thru the 3rd.  Also since the 
schedule is totally going to change, if i work the 30th of March could you 
put me on the day shift instead of night.  I had negotiated some changes so 
that would work however, since it is going to change anyway please put me on 
a day shift if possible as I already bought a ticket to leave on the evening 
of the 30th.  Thanks.

i will probably go however if it is the Fiesta bowl I wont be able to make 
it.  How is the family.  Are you guys planning on coming out anytime soon

Jesse, or Bill. The El Paso model was completely messed up for the entire day 
when I came in this evening.  I had to change several areas on the second 
page due to formula errors in mapping the deals over.  I am pretty sure it is 
correct now however, I would appreciate it if you could double check it for 
me.  I haven't sent it to El Paso yet as I had to change so many things I 
wanted a "second set of eyes"  Thanks man.  If maybe you guys could send out 
an email regarding mapping deals over correctly it would be greatly 
appreciated as it seems that there are errors on a daily basis

Becky at APS turned down a tag for me last night for HE 4MST that we have 
been using for several weeks without a problem.  The tag number is 18594.  
Tis was a sale from EPE to PNM at 4C.  She turned it down saying that EPE is 
not a control area at 4C and that PNM should be in the CA for the first 
line.  I argued with her about it for quite a while but she insisted that it 
was wrong.  Could you please take a look at this and tell me if she is wrong. 
Thank you.

I don't think threats of violence are appropriate in the workplace. I am

Thanks for the movie advice.  I am glad that you went out with Kathy and 
Charlene.  I think it is good for you guys to keep in touch.  I know people 
move on with their lives and grow out of touch but it seems like you guys 
have been friends for so long that it would be a shame for you to not keep in 
touch with each other.  Sorry we got in a fight yesterday. :(

Hi, please check on the following deals:

408661.01
410930.01
418614.01

The trader is Bill Williams III.

These three deals are in under British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority.  I 
believe they should be under British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation.

Please let me know if you change them.

Thank you,
Melissa

No come to find out Angelas little friend had herpes!  YUCK!  But actually 
you know her.  It is Nicole.  The girl that Jay was dating for a while.  Jay 
didn't care but it caused a huge fight between Angela and I.  It was pretty 
messy.

Are you guys going to the Beaver game this weekend and if so Wilson had 
mentioned that you guys were going down to his house on friday night.  Is 
this correct?  If so I would love to head down there with you guys on Friday 
but if not I will probably just stay in Portland and go to Corvallis on 
Saturday morning.  Let me know.

I dont know. We could go out in Northwest over by my house.  There are a ton 
of places over there like the Green Room, The Gypsy, Brazen Bean, 21st Ave 
Bar and Grill.  I don't realy know any places over by your house.  For me 
sometime around 8:00 would be good but really I am pretty easy as to where.  
Why don't you call me around 6pm on my cell at 702-0463 or at home 228-7767 
and we can figure it out. Unless you had any ideas?

I have set up the following BPA account numbers since we have been submitting 
dec bids at Malin the past few days:

CISO to PUGET  882716
CISO to WWP       681713
CISO to SCL         882790
CISO to Tacoma 882791

I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it 
would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or 
unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for 
Turlock to SCL.  SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to 
Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently 
been unwilling to do so.
 
TURLOCK to SCL  790612

These numbers have all been added to the RT BPA Account #'s spreadsheet in 
P:/realtime.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sounds like a blast.  My work thing was fun.  I broke my sobreity and got 
really drunk, went home and passed out at 8pm.  I was totally loaded.  It was 
very fun though. My interviews went awesome yesterday.  I think I will get 
that job.   So what do you have planned for the weekend?  Anything exciting?

I don't work on thursday or Friday so I could meet you guys for lunch either 
of those days.  Or we could grab a drink after work.  It would be nice to 
hang out more than just a few minutes for lunch.

Hey, sorry I didn't write you back sooner however I had a six day break.  
Anyway,  ST Pattys day was a blast, Dahl and Pat and I started drinking 
around 10am and by the time the night was over we had been to 10 different 
bars, (got kicked out of two)  met up with a ton of people and had an overall 
blast.  I was so hating it the next day.   My sister was up from LA this 
weekend.  We had a really good time.  Went to Touche and the Gypsy on 
Thursday, went to the Blazer game and then Scooters.  On Saturday night we 
went to the Kennedy School, and on Sunday we went to Multnomah Falls and took 
her to Beaches for lunch.  She had a really good time and it was nice to have 
her up for the weekend.  Anyway, how is everything with you?

Amy and John, several people within the Real Time Group are curious as to the 
process regarding our new holiday bonus pay.  We are all extremely grateful 
to have this new compensation package but some clarification would be 
great.    I would assume that we would be paid for working a holiday on the 
following pay period.  For example I worked on the Friday after Thanksgiving 
( Considered a minor holiday $250).  Would it be correct to assume that I 
would be paid for that holiday on December 15th?  Would this bonus pay be 
included in our regular paycheck or come seperate like an expense check? Is 
there anything we need to do?  It seems that several people within the group 
are unclear on this new policy other than the amount of the pay.   Could you 
please clarify this process for us?    Thank you for your attention to this 
matter and Happy Holidays!

Hey chica que pasa?  I am bored and its 2 in the freaking morning and I am 
sick and this really sucks.  Anyway this wasn't a mail to complain.   I 
wanted to know if you were still having your party on Saturday,  if I was 
still invited, if I could bring anything, and how to get to your house.  Well 
hope your day goes well.  One more night shift to go and then 5 days off for 
me!

How about if we just scrap the position all together and let Al Gore sell the 
White House to the Chinese at a Budhist Campaign Fundraiser  for the 
Democratic Party.  And then let the entire country be governed by 
referendum.  Oh wait, lets see there are 50 referendums on my ballot anyway 
so maybe we don't need state congress either.

and end up in the Holiday Bowl.  I would have definetly been able to go to 
that.   I am fucking pissed.  Anyway, I might still go to the Holiday Bowl 
and root for Texas.

Hey Katie, I am just getting off work here in a few minutes and thought i 
would drop you a line.  I am doing good.  I am sorry I missed your call on 
Saturday night.  I was at home and in bed by 9:30.  I went out until 3 am on 
Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 
6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I 
just went straight to bed I was soooo exhausted.  Skiing was awesome however, 
and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.  What a difference 
that made.  While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new 
skis, boots and poles.  I can't wait to try them out!  Anyway, things are 
going good for me.  I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads 
birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.  She had another heart 
failure.  She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to 
spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to 
Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.  I 
am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to 
go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.  Anyway, I better 
run.  I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the 
night shift.  How is everything with you?

13:16 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ Bonneville: Elec Emergency Putting Water
System At Risk
(This article was originally published Monday)

   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The Bonneville Power Administration - which manages
the federal hydroelectric generating system in the northwest U.S. - may not
have sufficient water to meet its power and fish obligations this winter and
spring, a spokesman said Monday.
"The way it's shaping up now, we are very concerned. We've had one of the
driest Novembers on record, and a very dry December," said Bonneville
spokesman Mike Hansen.
"Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to run
the system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion (for
fish in the river), we have some concerns for later on this winter for power
and for fish flows this April," Hansen said.
Due to the strains on the system, Bonneville has told the California
Independent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville can
supply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts are
otherwise imminent. Thursday, Bonneville rushed to California's rescue only
after the ISO declared its first-ever Stage 3 emergency, and blackouts were
avoided.
Water in the federal system's main storage reservoir, Coulee dam, is at
1,272 feet. The maximum capacity of the reservoir is 1,290 feet, and the
project is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to
1,208 feet.
Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty, the
normal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end of
December. Grand Coulee storage has fallen 14 feet since Nov. 1, during a
time when it is normally rising.
What's more, every gallon of water that rushes through the system's turbines
generates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations than
from lower ones, so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down.
"Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesn't mean we won't be able to
meet our obligations for fish flow. But it presents a riskier operation.
Everytime you draw them down, and combine them with cold weather, the
probability of meeting those flow requirements drops," Hansen said.
Normally, Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from California
utilities during the fall. However, California's economic boom has raised
electricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetual
importer.
Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normally
drafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for the
coming spring snow melt.
"We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at this
point," Hansen said.
If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet their
customers demand for electric heating, Bonneville will step in to avoid
blackouts. But each time that happens in the early part of the heating
season, it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help in
February or March.
Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals: avoiding floods, trying
to improve fish populations, recreation and power, which has the lowest
priority except in an electric supply emergency. The hydropower operator is
pretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contrary
obligations.
On a five-alarm scale, "We run at about two-and-a-half alarm averaged over
the year. If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says, we'll be in
a four- and-a-half or five real quick," Berry said
Bonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities and
the California. Under its federal tariff, it cannot ask for more than $68 a
megawatt-hour from the ISO, for example, though the ISO usually offers
$250/MWh.
But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to $3,000/MWh Friday in the
Northwest, and they have been running above $250/MWh for more than a week.
Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high market
levels in a couple of months - because it is being forced to rescue
California so frequently now.
The difference could mean a hundreds-of-million-dollar federal subsidy for
California, even though Bonneville's priority obligation is to Northwest
utilities according to its federal charter.
As a result, Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity under
exchange deals, whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts at
some later time. Those deals could make the ISO's already strained financial
situation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter.

13:15 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ Transalta Stops Pwr Sales To Cal-ISO;
Questions Credit
(This article was originally published Monday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Transalta, an investor-owned utility based in
Alberta, Canada, stopped selling power to the California Independent System
Operator at 6 p.m. PST Monday (0200 GMT Tuesday) because it fears the grid
operator won't be able to pay, market sources told Dow Jones Newswires.
For about eight hours Monday, Transalta sold the ISO 400 megawatts of power
from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at $1,000
a megawatt-hour, the source said. The 1,000 MW will cost the ISO about $3.2
million.
The cost of producing electricity at the 650-MW Centralia plant is about
$14-$15/MWh, company officials said.
Because the ISO, which manages electricity reliability in the state, was
buying a large quantity of power in the spot market, Transalta questioned
the ISO's credit-worthiness.
A Transalta spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment Monday.
Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date. Representatives
from the ISO wouldn't comment.
To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is, other
power suppliers, including British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH)
subsidiary PowerEx, have requested that the ISO secure a letter of credit
from one of the state's three investor-owned utilities before any
transactions take place. Last week, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern
California Edison did just that, issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for
$23 million.
Steve Maviglio, press secretary to California Gov. Gray Davis, confirmed
with Dow Jones Newswires that he received a telephone call from Transalta
saying the company planned to stop selling power to the grid operator Monday
evening.
The ISO has since called a stage-two power emergency and requested that
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. interrupt about 400 MW of power to large
industrial customers who get reduced rates in exchange for having their
power cut during peak demand periods.

Hr - Source

Prices Suggest What ISO Pays - Source
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Monday day-ahead prices into the California Power
Exchange hit a state-mandated $250 per megawatt hour price cap for every
single hour, the first time that has happened in the history of the CalPX,
said a source close to the issue.
"Our on-peak prices are at the cap, our off-peak prices are at the cap, our
average price is at the cap," the source said.
The prices are in line with December balance-of-month forward prices in the
Mid Columbia River market electricity hub, which hit $525/MWh, and January
forward prices, which hit $475/MWh on Monday.
Prices in the CalPX, which operates the state's day-of, day-ahead and block
forward electricity market, are likely an indication of the prices the
Independent System Operator is paying to secure that out-of-state
generation, the CalPX source said.
The California ISO, which must ensure the state's grid reliability and
operates 75% of the state real-time market, declared a stage-one electrical
emergency Monday, meaning operating reserves were below 7%.
The ISO said 10,000 MW of power was off line, and issued a call to buy 3,000
MW out of state.
It is strange that the CalPX would hit an across-the-board cap in the
winter, as opposed to the traditional high-peak summer season, market
sources said. The ISO has had an unusual winter, however, having declared an
unprecedented five stage-two power emergencies in November due to a large
amount of generation off line for planned and unplanned maintenace.

Hey dave.  I have a night shift tonight so thats why I am not getting back 
to  you until now.   Regarding Thanksgiving I have the 18th through the 23rd 
off. It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.  So this 
saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.  I 
am way fired up about it.  It should be a great time.  Then on Sunday 
afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down 
there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30.  
Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I 
will be able to spend thanksgiving day  and most of the week with all of 
you.  I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.  Maybe 
Sunday evening we can all have dinner together or something after i get in.  
Anyway looking forward to seeing all of you.  I should be able to come down 
again for Christmas as I have the 24th through the 29th off.  

Hey, have fun at the game and keep an eye on the scoreboard and root for the 
beavs!  If we win and Washington loses we go to the Rose Bowl  Take Care and 
see you this weekend!

  Thanks for being so nice about me venting.  I actually tried to call you 
but you were porbably in bed.  So I just went to the store grabbed as six 
pack had a few beers and sat at my computer for until about 3 am.  I was 
really having an enmotional night last night.  I think I just hadn't let go 
of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.  It is funny but the 
next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how 
I was doing.  Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons 
wedding?    If not I should tell you it is really funny.  Anyway as far as 
watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets.  
Benny,  Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and 
partying.  What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be 
going down there on no sleep.  Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that 
also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after 
thanksgiving.  So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I 
get back.  I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.  Did 
something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something?

The index forward is supposed to show no price so that is correct however the 
swap should be chaqnged to 25MW at $130
