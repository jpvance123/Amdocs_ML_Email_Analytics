Subject: Research and Development charges to GPG

Vince, Krishna and I met to discuss the Research and Development cross 
charges to GPG for January through June.  These charges are based upon a 
budgeted amount of allocating three resources to the GPG group (two resources 
for Revenue Management and one resource for GPG Marketing).  We have utilized 
the R&D group some during the first half of the year, but not to the full 
extent of three resources.  Vince and Krishna have agreed to reverse out some 
of the charges that were budgeted January through June.  We will revisit this 
issue again toward the end of the year to determine if any adjustments are 
necessary for July through December.  
 
The budgeted amount January through June has been distributed between the NNG 
and TW as follows:        
    Research and Development
    BUDGET ($000)             NNG TW ET&S  

January   $46.7  $  46.7  
February   $26.1 $20.4 $  46.5  
March    $35.9 $10.2 $  46.1  
April    $34.8 $10.2 $  45.0  
May     $36.4      $  8.8 $  45.2  
June     $36.4 $  8.8 $  45.2  
      $274.7  


Out of the $274.7 budgeted for the first half of the year, $199.7 is to be 
reversed back to the Research and Development Department.  This reversal will 
occur in July.  Vince, Vera Apodaca (ext.  X35980) will be our contact to 
help facilitate the reversal of these charges.  

Elaine, the remaining $75.0 ($274.7-$199.7) is to be allocated with $50.0 
going to the Revenue Management Work Order and  $25.0 remaining in O&M.

If anyone has any questions or needs additional information, please don't 
hesitate to call me (X33098).  Thanks, Kim.

Kim, I know you have been interested in the development of a long term 
Natural Gas Model for use in the ETS Revenue Management effort.  I agree that 
the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for North America 
should prove useful in ETS business development efforts, and in particular, 
in predicting the impact of the new, large Alaskan gas supplies on the N.A. 
pipeline grid.

As you know, Vince Kaminski feels that a software product developed by Dale 
Nesbitt (MarketPoint, Inc.) of Los Altos Hills, CA. may be a good choice, and 
one readily available in a relatively short time.  MarketPoint has proposed 
that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and 
testing, so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the 
software.  They have proposed a charge of $12,000, plus expenses, for the 
one-week session, with that cost applied to the first year's subscription 
price (approx. $55-60 M/yr) should we decide to go forward.  The other 
details (timing, ENE resources required, necessary IT interface, etc) still 
need to be worked out, but I believe there is generally a consensus to 
proceed with the test.  

With my recent relocation to the Clean Fuels group, I will no longer be 
responsible for the Alaskan pipeline development.  However, Danny McCarty is 
pulling together a team consisting of people from NNG, NBP and elsewhere in 
ETS to push the project forward.  I believe Eric Gadd will be playing a key 
role as well.  The decision on the long term gas model should appropriately 
be made by the new project team.   

I have attached a draft of the proposed MarketPoint License agreement.  It 
has not yet been fully reviewed by legal (or by Shelley C. for the 
"affiliate" issues).  

Let me know if I can provide any other background or assistance.

JNG

Mike,

Our department has been using your technical analysis to support commercial decisions.  You stated that these services would be discontinued.  We opted to use your technical analysis in lieu of outside services.  Please continue to provide technical analysis data with regard to natural gas (candlestick and Elliot wave).

Mike,

I work for Enron Transportation and Storage in their Storage Marketing group.  My group has been using technical analysis from your website to help make daily storage trading revenue decisions.  On your web site, you indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use.  We had interviewed external technical service profiders, and chose not to buy their service because we had your information available to us to help us make financial decisions.  Specifically, we need the candlestick charts and analysis on natural gas, and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural gas.  

Can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis data aforementioned?

In studying the below information, if I am understanding it correctly, only 
$199.7 was to be reversed back to the Research Group and it should 
have occurred in July.  Do you not notice this entry either?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Per mail dated June 15 from Kim Watson,  there was supposed to have occurred 
a true-up of $274.7 in July for the fist six months of 2000.  Reviewing July 
actuals,  I was not able to locate this entry.  Would you pls let me know 
whether this entry was made,  if not,  when do you intend to process it .  
thanks.

John:

Thanks for the information.  Chaim and I were aware that you might be
changing roles at Enron.  I am delighted Kim is slated to take over the
reins working with Vince.  Kim has put in a good bit of time in the past few
years reviewing our stuff and setting up contacts for us in your company.
We will give Kim a call early next week after Easter.  We have made a lot of
progress on MarketPoint, which I think will be of keen interest to your
team.  The introductory activity as well as the ongoing, inhouse
architecture are both improved relative to what you and your people were
able to review, and I anticipate you will be pleased and impressed.

John, it isnt that easy for you to get away from us!   Remember the story of
the tar baby.  (Just kidding.)  All the best, and I hope we get the chance
to serve you and make your organization even better.

Dale

I discussed the numbers with Vince and we have the sign off from him. So, 
Vera and Shirley, you can go ahead to execute the adjustment.
Thanks,

Krishna, 

Attached is a spreadsheet with the figures we discussed earlier.  For 
July-Dec, ETS will keep half of the amount allocated (equivalent to 1.5 
employees, $135.6) from the corporate allocations to ETS.  If this looks OK 
to you, I would like to have Vera work with Shirley to handle the accounting 
adjustment similar to mid year.  Many thanks, Kim.


Vera,

Here is the Year 2000 spreadsheet.  As you will see, we will need to work 
with Shirley Crenshaw (X35290) with Enron Research Group to coordinate a 
similar accounting adjustment to the one we made mid year.  I will send the 
Year 2001 Budgeted spreadsheet to you in the next few days (just in case it 
changes with the approval of the science workorder).  Please call me if you 
have any questions about this spreadsheet.  Thanks, Kim.

Mike,

I work for Enron Transportation and Storage in their Storage Marketing 
group.  My group has been using technical analysis from your website to help 
make daily storage trading revenue decisions.  On your web site, you 
indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use.  We had 
interviewed external technical service profiders, and chose not to buy their 
service because we had your information available to us to help us make 
financial decisions.  Specifically, we need the candlestick charts and 
analysis on natural gas, and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural 
gas.  

Can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis 
data aforementioned?

Lorrian and Michel,

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Vince, 

LIBERTY GAS STORAGE PROJECT - We appreciated the insight from Zimin Lu on the 
Liberty Gas Storage project.  I had originally thought that Enron could 
negotiate a deal directly with HNG Storage Co. on the joint development of 
these facilities.  However, HNGS has now retained Wasserstein Pirella to 
"market" the opportunity.  [FYI - Wasserstein was the Investment Banker that 
handled the recent sale of the Market Hub Partners storage facilities, so 
they certainly would have a current list of interested parties.]  
Unfortuneately, we will now have to participate in another "auction" if we 
are to pursue this further.  I'll let you know what we decide to do.

ALASKA / NORTHERN CANADA PIPELINE - I would like to discuss ways that Enron 
might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring 
substantial new gas reserves from Alaska and northern Canada to the lower 
48.  A large equity investment in a very expensive, regulated pipeline is not 
likely to get much support within Enron.  Instead, our competitive advantage 
may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the 
existing US pipeline grid, ("backhaul" on Northern Natural, expansion 
opportunities on Northern Border and NNG, or even capacity exchanges with 
other pipeline operators).

I think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact 
of the evolving North American marketplace on that initiative, and vice 
versa.  Any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual "winners" 
and "losers" if / when that large volume of new gas enters the market would 
be valuable. 

I will look forward to our discussion tomorrow (Thursday) at 1:30 PM.  

Regards, JNG
