I need to do a draft for a paper confirmation that is an Omnibus Swaption. 
The only template that I have is the one I attached. Is it O.K. to use? Can I 
use the current ISDA one and tweek it to be an Omnibus (ie: Determination 
Periods, no reference to ISDA)? 

Thanks,

Jarrod

Please take a look at the attached confirmation. It is a lumber deal with two 
commodities on one confirmation. This was requested by the Counterparty.

I have attached a draft for a Prepaid Swap. This deal needs to be structured 
in such a way that the Fixed price is payed once, and the floating price is 
then paid every month. Please let me know if I can use the attached Draft.  


If you have any questions please give me a call (ext. 35700).

Hey Sara,

Would you please look over this omnibus option template that I took from TAGG 
and modify it as you see fit for the Paper World?

Many thanks,

Lucy

P.S.
This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the 
template in place anyway.  For future deals of course.

happy to go over it with you.

Thank you,

Pursuant to our conversation, the different scenarios for trades in dispute 
are (and may not be limited to) the following:

Trade agreed Trade not booked    No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed on T/D  No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Killed after T/D  No confirm sent
Trade agreed Trade booked  Trade killed  Confirm sent

Trade booked Trade disputed     No Confirm sent
Trade booked  Trade disputed     Confirm sent

Examples:

Scenario 1: the CP calls back one hour after the trade was agreed and states 
they now do not agree with the trade. Essentially, it could be disputed 
wether or not we had a trade, even though our tapes support our position. No 
impact on booking or Confirmation Desk.

Scenarios 2 and 3 occur essentially the same as Scenario 1 with the exception 
that the trade is booked. Scenario 2 and 3 a different based on the pricing 
implication of a trade booked overnight. In both these scenarios, we should 
consider issuing a Termination Agreement which gives some reference to the 
details of the agreed transaction.

Scenario 4 is the most straight-forward. An agreed trade, booked and 
Confirmed, we issue a Termination Agreement.

Scenarios 5 and 6 are different from Scenarios 2 and 3 in that we have booked 
a trade based on our understanding, but OUR understanding of the terms was 
incorrect. The two scenarios are different in that in 5 a Confirmation is not 
sent. In 5, we should consider issuing a side letter stating that a trade was 
booked in error and no such trade exists. In 6 we should consider issuing a 
side letter stating the trade was booked AND the Confirmation was sent in 
error - and ask that they return the Confirmation.

I have attached another swaption for your review. This one will be contigent 
upon us having an ISDA and closing on another project. I know we have worked 
on some with that language and the only one I can find is the Quaker Swaption 
which I emailed to you earlier today.

For a deal with Southern they would like to amend the true up period to be 90 
days. 

This is some language we used on an older deal under Special Provisions:

For purposes of this Transaction, the phrase "within 30 calendar days" in 
line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the 
phrase "within 90 calendar days."

Is it O.K. to use this again.

Please review the attached sample swap confirmation.
Like I said, Rob Scheuer is trying to create the Lumber Market and would like 
to use ISDA documents in the future.  
He will be passing this sample swap confirmation out to many potential 
customers.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Many thanks and kind regards,

Lucy
