Hi Jeff,

 My research colleagues and I are working on a document to lay out our credit 
derivatives modeling strategy.  For lack of a better term, we refer to this 
as our credit business plan.

 It is my understanding that various business plans have been previously 
written for the credit group - one by Gillian Johnson and another by John 
Bottomley.

 It would be very helpful to our efforts in the research group, it you would 
allow us to see these plans.

Thanks,
Iris

Hi Iris

We started off with about 105 companies, which were Enron Europe's UK power 
and gas desk counterparties. I'm not sure where you got the figure of 500 
from - maybe this is the entire Enron Europe counterparty list, which 
constitutes the next major effort for end-July.

>From this list of 104, only the 72 in the spreadsheet had information in 
Amadeus. The other firms had no information available, most likely because 
they were too new.

Ben

Hi again,

 Thanks for the financial data on Enron's European counterparties.

 It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such 
counterparties.  However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72 
of these European counterparties.

 Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400+ other 
counterparties? 

Thanks so much,
Iris

Hi Iris

The inputs and outputs generated by RiskCalc can be seen in the attached file:

 << File: Data for RiskCalc - 20010323_PD.csv >> 

We only looked at the 5-yr PD.

Inputs are in columns A-U. These are the inputs generated by Amadeus. You can 
run these inputs through the RiskCalc model over the web 
(http://www.moodysqra.com/privfirm) using the login: dupred, password: 
detective. This is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks (Mike 
Mumford will have more details about the current licence)

Tomas Valnek was getting the data from the Amadeus database, so I'll leave it 
to him to determine if Houston access is possible. In the meantime you can 
use the dataset attached for testing purposes.

Hi Ben,

 How are you?  Today we had a meeting with Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman to 
discuss the private firm model.

 They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the Moody's 
Riskcalc model.  I noticed that you also have been looking at RiskCalc - as 
indicated in your paper entitled "Pricing Parent Companies and their 
Subsidiaries:  Model Description and Data Requirements"

 Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test 
statistics, scores, etc.  

 Also, you stated that you used Amadeus database.  We are in the process of 
trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.  
In the mean time, may we have access to the Amadeus database or some sample 
dataset?

 
Thanks so much,
Iris

Hi Iris

I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much 
rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up-to-date, 
or were written poorly and under time-pressure, so what do you envisage 
eventually sending to Duffie?

Hi Ben,


 I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative 
model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

 These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted 
any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to 
read).

 Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,

Craig and Kim,

 As you know,  I have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to Moody's 
RiskCalc.

 You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc.

 Well, after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through 
today's 2-hour Moody's presentation, it is necessary for us to have 
information about Enron's counterparties to move to the next step with 
RiskCalc.

 We have obtained some information on Enron's European counterparties from 
our colleagues in the London office.

 We need for you and/or your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us 
with a list of Enron's North American counterparties.  

 More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following 
financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:

  
  
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements 
are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, 
such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be 
a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 
2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation 
is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In 
general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size 
affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 
makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not). 

Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities. 

Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, 
without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average 
Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and 
supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would 
include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, 
insurance costs, and storage costs.

Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, 
marketable securities, and other current assets. 

Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. 
For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total 
assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment 
plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, 
and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for 
Australian companies. 

Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are 
short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 


Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number 
representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other 
noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and 
minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative 
earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. 
Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less 
distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low 
credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank 
for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of 
actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) 
reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances 
for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number 
less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to 
production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or 
items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative 
Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It 
can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- 
and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the 
prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of 
computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after 
expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the 
fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A 
loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would 
be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian 
companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes 
appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as 
extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and 
discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, 
income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of 
accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as 
positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for 
Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 


 We look forward to receiving this information for Enron's private firm North 
American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the 
evaluation of RiskCalc.


Thanks,
Iris

This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 


	We look forward to receiving this information for Enron's private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc.


Thanks,
Iris

FYI. 

Shirley (3-5290) is making travel arrangements for me.


It makes sense for all of us to stay in the same hotel, 
irrespective of individual travel arrangements

Dear Vince,

Thanks for your note.  I look forward to seeing you on the 20th.

We usually recommend our visitors to stay at the Park Hyatt on Battery
Street.  It's a 5 minute cab ride (or an easy 15 minute walk) to our
offices.  Should you decide to walk, it is important that you take Sansome
Street rather than Montgomery.  They are one block apart, but one goes up to
the top of Telegraph hill and ends before continuing at the bottom of a
cliff and the other is relatively flat and is continuous.  There are
detailed directions on our website (www.kmv.com).

See you on the 20th.

Regards,

Rob

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information 
on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would 
be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to 
gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly 
employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to 
Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she 
could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that 
might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely 
efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to 
begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 
Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, 
it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration 
sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi,

 As per your request, here is a very rough draft of the document you 
requested.  It is far from being complete.

 Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

 Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Hi Scott,

	As we discussed, I will be flying to London on Monday to spend some time in Enron's London office.  I am really looking forward to meeting you and the others I have corresponded with via email, phone, VC, etc.

	On yesterday Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I discussed my stay and London and the desire to make this trip a productive one.  Hence we came up with the following "wish list" of things I wish to accomplish while I am over there.


	If you think of any other important items to add to this list, please let me know.  After that, we can forward the list to the parties involved to find out if they will be available to meet with me during my stay in London.

Thanks,
Iris

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our 
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts 
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following 
the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for 
the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and 
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs 
covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots           Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 
month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month 
end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end 
performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 
month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the 
performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ 
days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big 
picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for 
analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a 
modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

It's OK to delay the materials for Duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain.

Subject:	Having Iris visit London

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi,

 How are you?  London seems to be the same as when I left in August - no sun, 
cold, serious looking people, expensive, etc.  In addition, we have had May 
Day riots, a post office bombing, train strike, etc.  Not to mention all the 
excitement in Enron Credit.

 It would be nice to know who I am supposed to be reporting to.  I am getting 
loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from 
Vasant.  According to you and Slava, the strategy paper/Duffie report seems 
to be a higher priority.  However, Vasant seems to indicate (in his forwarded 
email) that this is not the priority at the moment.

 In addition, there seems to be lots of chaos in Enron Credit - not only in 
the Houston office, but even more so in the London office.  This brings to 
mind a Russian proverb I learned from Slava when he expressed his views on 
the current state of Enron Credit - " a fish rots from the head."

 Finally, I would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this 
Duffie report:  Do you want to hear what Enron Credit would like to hear - 
that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their 
exisiting "infrastructure"?  Or do you want to hear what I really see, hear, 
read, etc.?  If the latter is true, then I may need to write two reports, 
because what I am learning does not look too good and would probably not make 
the Enron Credit personnel too happy.

 Well, I think I have said enough for now.  Look forward to your feedback.

Thanks,
Iris

Hi Iris,

 Amitava must have told you that both he and I are getting swamped with work 
here.  As a result, we expect you to take the lead in scoping the Enron 
credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied.  You should 
also make sure to understand the econometric/data analysis software side of 
the project -- this is probably more important than preparing a document for 
Duffie right now.  You should definitely sit with Ben/George and actually run 
the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used.  But we also 
need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data.  Both 
Amitava and I will help as best as we can, and answer any direct questions, 
but we will have limited time to review documents, etc.  I expect Amitava to 
get heavily involved once data starts coming, but we expect you to have 
already set up the infrastructure etc for the data.

Hope the trip is going well.  Would you be extending the trip for some more 
time?

Vasant

Hi Scott,

 As we discussed, I will be flying to London on Monday to spend some time in 
Enron's London office.  I am really looking forward to meeting you and the 
others I have corresponded with via email, phone, VC, etc.

 On yesterday Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I discussed my stay and London and 
the desire to make this trip a productive one.  Hence we came up with the 
following "wish list" of things I wish to accomplish while I am over there.


 If you think of any other important items to add to this list, please let me 
know.  After that, we can forward the list to the parties involved to find 
out if they will be available to meet with me during my stay in London.

Thanks,
Iris

All:

This is the rough schedule we came up with at today's video conference:

Submit RFP to D&B, Experian, and Amadeus 2 days  25 Apr  Mumford
Receive back RFPs     1.5 weeks 4 May  Mumford
Complete evaluation, selection & authorization 1 week  11 May  Mumford/Mack
Contract complete and signed   2 weeks 25 May  Mumford
Data to Iris & Amitava    3 weeks 15 June  Mumford
Model Development Complete   4 weeks 15 July  Mack
*Integration of model and data feeds into CTS 6 weeks 30 August Kirkpatrick

Prior to integration into CTS any prices would have to be manually uploaded 
into CTS via spreadsheet. 

The RFP will include a request for a smaller data calibration set that we may 
select to purchase immediately.

We can revisit this schedule at our Wednesday Video Conference.

Hi Iris,

I wasn't sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not, but I've been thinking about ways that his group (or the Research team) could really add value in an area where we're admittedly weak - model testing.  If you haven't sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.  I'm hoping there are some statistical techniques we're currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.

If you've got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, I'd love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we're starting a model recalbration phase.  I'm least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we've recalibrated them.

Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Regards,
Scott

Subject: Asset Swaps vs CDS's

John, 

I haven't had much time to put something together on this issue.  
Fundamentally both instruments represent the same credit risk, i.e. same 
credit events and contingent payments, both represent senior unsecured credit 
risk.  The differences in pricing therefore arise purely from supply and 
demand.  One would expect generally that the asset swap would be lower than 
the CDS because of liquidity:  there are only so many bonds out there, and so 
demand for Asset swaps is limited.  I am attaching a one page note by JP 
morgan where they claim that one of the principal reasons for the CDS to be 
more expensive is people hedging convertible bonds by combining  (1) a call 
option on the equity and (2) a CDS.  If the call is cheap they will be 
willing to pay more for the CDS, driving the price up.  I'll try to 
synthesize something more complete next week.

Cheers

Martin

Hi again,

	Some of you have been kind enough to supply me with information that can be used for the strategic plan (I am writing for Duffie).

	To assist you in gathering further information, it was suggested that I forward a preliminary outline of this strategic plan to your attention. 


Thanks in advance for your assistance,
Iris

I will make sure you get on this distribution list.

Credit is going to be a big issue for energy companies and banks.

We may need to form additional discussion groups.

Volatility in energy prices and a general economic slowdown may cause an
increase in defaults.

Banks are primarily interested in regulatory impact on loan portfolio and
credit derivatives as a an alternative to raising capital or selling assets.

Energy companies could use credit derivatives to hedge or price credit
exposure.

Don Mumma(ex CSFB, MD Axiom Software)is organizing a survey of energy credit
practices. You can reach Don at 212-248-4188 ext 22.

13 , 2000


Dear members of the credit derivatives group.

You've probably been wondering if I would ever get the minutes of last weeks
meeting out. Well, here they are and I sincerely apologize for the delay. I
always thought this time of year is supposed to be slow, but unfortunately,
the opposite has been the case.

Please pay particular attention to the action points. We can only handle
these meetings successfully if each and everyone of you actively
participates and plays a role! The next meeting can only be scheduled if
there is enough feedback available.

Wishing you happy holidays,

Regards,

Jeannette

Minutes of the GARP NY Credit Derivatives Meeting - December 13,2000

The meeting was generously hosted by WestLB

Attendees:
Matthew Bianco
Claudia Cappelli
Joe Carrozzo
Jeannette Gerber
Tom Mansley
Philip Merrill
Joe Pimbley
Marian Trano-Lepisto

(due to some technical problems, not all attendees received the invitations
on time.)

Summary
The aim of this first meeting was to decide on topics, people involvement
and the format of future meetings.

Topics
The following topics were discussed for discussion in future meetings:
* New models and structures available
* practical work issues
* credit risk policy
* ISDA issues / documentation
* regulatory issues / BIS capital
* hedging issues (e.g. embedded options, rollover, funded vs unfunded,
etc.)
* electronic trading issues
* general technology issues and information on new systems available
* pricing differentials
* pricing sources
* current models used for pricing, VaR
* credit event monitoring
* counterparty suitability

Action: all members to check with credit derivatives colleagues within their
organization to go over the list and complete.
Action: all members to pick topics they could lead through (or they could
organize someone to lead through).

People Involved
The involvement will depend on the topic. A member of the group will lead
through a meeting, or organize a credit derivative professional to lead
through the meeting, depending on the topic.

Meeting Format
We expect a series of evening workshops to take place about every 6 weeks.
In order to get active discussions going, all participants are expected to
inquire within their own institutions as to how the particular subject under
discussion is being treated in-house. We feel that the meetings will only be
successful if all participants are actively involved in the process.

We expect most members to be able to host the meeting once a year. Please
let me know if and when you could host a meeting.

Action: all members to check if and when they can host a meeting.

The date and venue for the next meeting will be announced in early January,
depending on your feedback on the topics.

Hi,

	How are you?  London seems to be the same as when I left in August - no sun, cold, serious looking people, expensive, etc.  In addition, we have had May Day riots, a post office bombing, train strike, etc.  Not to mention all the excitement in Enron Credit.

	It would be nice to know who I am supposed to be reporting to.  I am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from Vasant.  According to you and Slava, the strategy paper/Duffie report seems to be a higher priority.  However, Vasant seems to indicate (in his forwarded email) that this is not the priority at the moment.

	In addition, there seems to be lots of chaos in Enron Credit - not only in the Houston office, but even more so in the London office.  This brings to mind a Russian proverb I learned from Slava when he expressed his views on the current state of Enron Credit - " a fish rots from the head."

	Finally, I would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this Duffie report:  Do you want to hear what Enron Credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "infrastructure"?  Or do you want to hear what I really see, hear, read, etc.?  If the latter is true, then I may need to write two reports, because what I am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the Enron Credit personnel too happy.

	Well, I think I have said enough for now.  Look forward to your feedback.

Thanks,
Iris

Hi Iris,

	Amitava must have told you that both he and I are getting swamped with work here.  As a result, we expect you to take the lead in scoping the Enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied.  You should also make sure to understand the econometric/data analysis software side of the project -- this is probably more important than preparing a document for Duffie right now.  You should definitely sit with Ben/George and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used.  But we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data.  Both Amitava and I will help as best as we can, and answer any direct questions, but we will have limited time to review documents, etc.  I expect Amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming, but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data.

Hope the trip is going well.  Would you be extending the trip for some more time?

Vasant

Subject: Credit Risk Model Comments - at this point.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some=20
questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid=20
writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so=20
exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure=20
complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode=
ls=20
for each contract. However, the JC Penny=01,s version can serve as a testin=
g=20
platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to=
=20
the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so=
=20
some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get bac=
k.=20

1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to=
=20
regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and=
=20
re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done alrea=
dy.

2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input cred=
it=20
rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contrac=
t=20
period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me tha=
t=20
the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating=20
transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies=20
changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some=20
constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a=
=20
more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3) Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that=
=20
the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different=20
business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we a=
re=20
dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not=
=20
get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom=
ery=20
Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so=20
fundamental for a company=01,s success and default actions can be used as a=
 way=20
to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does no=
t=20
neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for=
 a=20
life preserver are more likely to live than those that don=01,t. By that I =
mean=20
that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th=
e=20
credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=20
contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn=01,t=
.=20
This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn=01,t consider. Th=
is=20
would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables=
=20
and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special financ=
e=20
team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If =
we=20
can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a=
=20
better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the=
=20
current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop=
=20
some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6) A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments.=20
Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent=20
error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random numb=
er=20
generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a proble=
m=20
in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effe=
ct=20
of using different random number generators on Enron=01,s aggregate credit =
risk?

7) There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improve=
d"=20
analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20

Mark, this is a good point.  In Moody's June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for 
Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year 
of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year).   Reading from the 
graph finds:





As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the 
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years 
and standard deviation of 1.20 years).  The interesting point is the slide in 
recovery value 1996 to 1998.   One would wonder if the mix of high-yield 
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries 
(quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).  

Interesting to note is the December 1999 to December 2000 change in spreads.  
The table below divides the December 2000 spreads by the December 1999 
spreads.   One would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this 
time-frame, but the figures are more mixed:

In looking at the One-Year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how 
many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981-1999)  
historical default rates (%):

1991                            
0.12                                           10.40

2.5x


Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals 
default rates to obtain a "multiple" (how much more severe than historical):


                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         infinite      44.2x       21.7x
AA            67.0x        19.4x       18.5x
A               24.5x         19.1x      14.2x
BBB           5.6x           5.5x        6.2x
BB             3.6x           2.1x         2.6x 
B                 1.1x           1.2x        1.7x


On the 10 year historical figures,  we need to be careful as the S&P static 
pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably 
due to prepayment) versus our contracts.  Secondly, the S&P figures have 
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some 
information content.   

I will ask Emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would STRONGLY  suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful 
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right

I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market 
implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.  He is 
seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the 
methodology employed in calculating the implied figures.     I will follow

Subject: Risk article

Everyone should read the attached Risk article about calculating def probs 
from CDS quotes. 

Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both 
CDS valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the 
reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating CDS quotes, 
they propose minimising an error measure based on 'smoothness' of def prob 
curve and difference between model and market prices. 

What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in 
Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus 
one excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have similar work published ourselves.

Subject:	Credit Risk Model Comments - at this point.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back. 

1)	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.

2)	The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3)	Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4)	A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5)	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If we can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6)	A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments. Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enron's aggregate credit risk?

7)	There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improved" analysis could make the credit risk be higher. 

Rick

Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.   I 
have placed Mark Ruane's yields against a mid November default frequency 
table.   Note there may be a slight shearing in dates, but the concept is 
more important:


Market implied cumulative default rates (%):

Hi Ben,


 I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative 
model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

 These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted 
any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to 
read).

 Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris

We can continue the discussion in Tuesday's conference call, but I discussed 
with Ben about the issues below, and here are some thoughts.  This is NOT a 
complete approach, but only a starting point for discussion.

The main task is to build a pricing system for many names.
This has two components --- 
1) How to price a single name?
 1.1) How to price a liquid single name?
 1.2) How to price an illiquid single name?
2) How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names?

The approach I would take for 1.1 is 
a) Define a small set of liquid names
b) Apply each of the different models we have, say, the six models Ben has 
mentioned below, to these names
c) Include market prices, if any, for these names
d) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each liquid name should 
price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) and (c)
e) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion 
of the trader prices across the models
f) Quantify these attributes, if possible
g) Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process, and see if the 
decisions in the last round still make sense

The approach for 1.2 may be
a) Define a small set of illiquid names
b) Apply each of the different models we have to these names
c) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each illiquid name 
should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b)
d) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion 
of the trader prices across the models
e) Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names
f)  Define a master set of liquid names
g) Look for relationships (by analyzing cross-section of data) between 
attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names 

Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names 
and their attributes, then this mapping can be entered into a table, and the 
pricing can be automated for all names (IN THEORY)!  The success will depend 
on the success of the round-table sessions for the approaches for 1.1 and 
1.2.  

Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task, but we can get 
going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any 
new models that we may build.  New models can be added to the suite of 
existing models. I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will 
answer all questions for all names, but rather we can refine the mappings and 
relative choices among models over time, which would mean continuing 
round-table sessions with traders.  Limited data makes calibration very hard, 
so I would continually ask the question "What do we calibrate?" throughout 
the discussions for 1.1 and 1.2, and this may help guide us to new models.

Subject: Pricing credit on thousands of names

All -

Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to 
provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [5,000 by year-end]. 
Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information, 
making the challenge harder, and the end result more important in terms of 
competitive pricing advantage. What we need is an overall strategy for how we 
plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective.

Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under 
development:
FMC Model (default probability approach). Using Bloomberg's Fair Market (par 
yield) Curves, probabilities are generated from the risky-LIBOR, then 
default/bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology.
FMC Model (credit spread approach). Using the FMCs, then directly taking the 
LIBOR credit spread at each tenor, adjusting for basis and compounding 
differences.
Bond Model (FMC approach). Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves, the model 
regresses the input bonds (specific to a name) on the two best fitting 
benchmarks. The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs, 
but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer. Prices are then generated 
using both spread and probability approaches. Under testing.
Bond Model (spline approach). Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer, 
the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero-coupon price curve, 
then builds a zero yield curve from this. Under testing.
Market Prices. For certain liquid names, or sectors/ratings, CDS market 
prices are used, then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap 
prices.
KMV. Using Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) from the KMV model and 
database, we will build a model to price default swaps, making appropriate 
risk adjustments. KMV is being installed now, so model will be worked on next.

Each of these models returns a price (credit default and bankruptcy), and the 
accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory 
differences between bond and CDS markets, recovery assumptions, risk premia, 
capital charges, etc. The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid 
names as possible, based upon these models, then use these prices, alongside 
other financial information, as the backbone to a full automated pricing 
system. 

Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and 
market prices for all issuers, alongside name-specific 'soft' data from 
credit reports and financial statements. If the credit is liquid enough, a 
price will be generated from their own information only. Otherwise, the 
credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits, with financial 
information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights. 
The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with 
market (or trader) prices, and this adjustment will feed back into the 
weighting and mapping composition. In loose terms, we could think of the 
system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid 
market prices (bonds, equities, default swaps), where the weightings are 
calibrated using credit analysis, financial ratios, etc.

The key steps to implementing such a system will be:
Establishing what exactly we want to 'predict' - is it a price, a rating, a 
probability, or a score? We will need a clean market history to calibrate to, 
which we only really have for ratings. We will then need to develop a mapping 
from rating/score to price.
Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to 
calibrate the model.
Building the mechanics of the model, ie, the calibration methodology. Neural 
nets/fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates, but which exact methods and 
software packages to use?
Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited 
information into the model.
Getting the "true" market price, in order to feed back an error. At present 
such a price exists for very few credits.
Allocating resources to the development. McKinsey claimed such a system would 
take 6-10 man-months to develop.

Further ideas or comments are requested, as we need to develop our strategy 
asap. The model description above is fairly vague, as we don't yet have the 
knowledge needed to fill in the specific details. Further help will be 
especially required on this if we are to continue to move at 'internet speed'.

Regards

Ben

Hi Shirley,

 This email is in reference to your vmail regarding my rescheduling my 
meeting on tomorrow at 2 pm with Vince.  That is fine with me because the 
Credit guys (Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman) have had a change in strategy.

 They have asked us to take some time to evaluate Moody's Riskcalc software.  
Therefore I have had to put the Duffie project on hold for the last few 
days.  However I am about two thirds through the Duffie documents and will 
resume studying them as soon as I get through the lengthy RiskCalc documents.

 Let me know if he still wants to meet later in the week

Thanks,
Iris.

Bill and Mark,
the figure below shows you what happens when we simulate forward prices using 
current methodology of our Credit Reserve Model.
The time scale on this figure goes from 0 to 30 years. I started with $5.2 
gas prices at time 0 and used the NG forward volatility curve which
has 50% volatilities in the front and 13.5% vols for long-term contracts. You 
can see from the figure, that, for example, at 30 years horizon
the price will be more than $13.4 with probability 5% but less than $22.1 
with probability 99%. The corresponding lower bounds are
$1.17 and $0.71.

Both seem to provide fairly unrealistic values.  $50 gas over the term seems 
improbable, however, a $6 gas peak does not represent capture all potential 
price movement at 99% confience interval.

What were your assumptions on price curves, volatilty curves, and trend 
reversion?

A quick example of the impact of using GBM based simulation:  Based on a five

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some=20
questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid=20
writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so=20
exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure=20
complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode=
ls=20
for each contract. However, the JC Penny=01,s version can serve as a testin=
g=20
platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to=
=20
the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so=
=20
some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get bac=
k.=20

1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to=
=20
regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and=
=20
re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done alrea=
dy.

2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input cred=
it=20
rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contrac=
t=20
period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me tha=
t=20
the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating=20
transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies=20
changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some=20
constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a=
=20
more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3) Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that=
=20
the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different=20
business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we a=
re=20
dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not=
=20
get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom=
ery=20
Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so=20
fundamental for a company=01,s success and default actions can be used as a=
 way=20
to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does no=
t=20
neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for=
 a=20
life preserver are more likely to live than those that don=01,t. By that I =
mean=20
that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th=
e=20
credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=20
contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn=01,t=
.=20
This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn=01,t consider. Th=
is=20
would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables=
=20
and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special financ=
e=20
team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If =
we=20
can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a=
=20
better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the=
=20
current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop=
=20
some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6) A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments.=20
Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent=20
error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random numb=
er=20
generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a proble=
m=20
in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effe=
ct=20
of using different random number generators on Enron=01,s aggregate credit =
risk?

7) There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improve=
d"=20
analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots											Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end			12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end				12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end					12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end				12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

Hi again,

 Thanks for the financial data on Enron's European counterparties.

 It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such 
counterparties.  However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72 
of these European counterparties.

 Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400+ other 
counterparties? 

Thanks so much,
Iris

Hi Iris

The inputs and outputs generated by RiskCalc can be seen in the attached file:

 << File: Data for RiskCalc - 20010323_PD.csv >> 

We only looked at the 5-yr PD.

Inputs are in columns A-U. These are the inputs generated by Amadeus. You can 
run these inputs through the RiskCalc model over the web 
(http://www.moodysqra.com/privfirm) using the login: dupred, password: 
detective. This is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks (Mike 
Mumford will have more details about the current licence)

Tomas Valnek was getting the data from the Amadeus database, so I'll leave it 
to him to determine if Houston access is possible. In the meantime you can 
use the dataset attached for testing purposes.

Hi Ben,

 How are you?  Today we had a meeting with Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman to 
discuss the private firm model.

 They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the Moody's 
Riskcalc model.  I noticed that you also have been looking at RiskCalc - as 
indicated in your paper entitled "Pricing Parent Companies and their 
Subsidiaries:  Model Description and Data Requirements"

 Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test 
statistics, scores, etc.  

 Also, you stated that you used Amadeus database.  We are in the process of 
trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.  
In the mean time, may we have access to the Amadeus database or some sample 
dataset?

 
Thanks so much,
Iris

We have not done any recent analysis since the end of January or maybe even 
the end of December.  I will have Rod Nelson and Tanya Rohauer relook at the 
impact of the changing yield curve on Credit Reserve.

We have a lot of improvements we need to make on our current methodology when 
we have the time and resources to dedicate to it.

Bill,

Most recent Vincent's update on what's going on with the credit  model.

Another issue. I am increasingly concerned with our general approach to the 
generation
of probabilities of default. Recent developments in the credit markets are 
likely to
change completely the dynamics and levels of  interest rate spreads. I am 
curious if
you looked at the credit reserve based on the current yield curves (as of the 
last few days).

Hi again,

 As, I stated is a prior emails, the contact details for the RiskCalc folks 
are as follows:

1.  Marc Brammer
Director of Strategic Sales
tel:  800.523.2627, x5706
mbrammer@MoodysRMS.com

2. Neal Clark
Vice President
Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701
nclark@MoodysRMS.com

 Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their 
quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or 
not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.

 Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between 
Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London.


Ciao,
Iris

Iris/Amitava,

I may have already said this, but we've had so many e-mails and telephone 
calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this 
much out to you.  Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the 
RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell) 
and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model 
may have.  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model 
extends to other countries.  I know from a previous conversation with Lea 
Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American 
names but they suspect it might extend to other countries.  Conversely, I 
know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to 
develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions.  One 
they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe.  Data, as 
always, was the issue.  See if the quants have any perspective on their 
success/plan in that area.

Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward 
pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be 
able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi,

 Two RiskCalc sales people made a presentation this week about their product.

 They stated that they could set up a meeting with their quants and our 
people to discuss the model input and what happens if we have less than 17 
inputs.

Ooops... part II.

I just threw out 12 as a number for something we might develop... it's really 
not based on anything.  We know 17 will work for pre-packaged programs.  We 
also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17... 
I assume we would pursue another model (internal or external) to provide 
probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer 
inputs.

Hi Mike,

 Thanks for your email.

 What do you mean by "buying blind  all major data associated with these 
specific DUNS numbers"?

 I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know 
RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work 
for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte 
that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.  They 
suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who 
developed the model.

Regards,
Iris

Iris,

Thanks.

After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.

Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS 
cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could 
greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major 
data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.

Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without 
resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for 
completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of 
which fields, etc.).

Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we 
need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We 
would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal 
buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly 
increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size, 
etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.


Any thoughts.



Mike

It's OK to delay the materials for Duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain.

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

Subject: Default rates


Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.   I 
have placed Mark Ruane's yields against a mid November default frequency 
table.   Note there may be a slight shearing in dates, but the concept is 
more important:


Market implied cumulative default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.51           5.74         14.54           
AA            0.67           6.39          16.61
A               0.98           8.98          21.03
BBB         1.17           9.88          22.39
BB             3.27        18.62          37.51
B                4.65         24.21         46.27



S&P Historical default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.00           0.13          0.67           
AA            0.01           0.33          0.90
A               0.04           0.47          1.48
BBB         0.21           1.81           3.63
BB             0.91          8.82          14.42
B                5.16         20.95         27.13


In looking at the One-Year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how 
many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981-1999)  
historical default rates (%):


                             Investment grade                Non-Investment 
grade
Avg. 1981-99            0.07                                             4.21
1991                            
0.12                                           10.40
Multiple                      1.7x                                            
2.5x


Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals 
default rates to obtain a "multiple" (how much more severe than historical):


                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         infinite      44.2x       21.7x
AA            67.0x        19.4x       18.5x
A               24.5x         19.1x      14.2x
BBB           5.6x           5.5x        6.2x
BB             3.6x           2.1x         2.6x 
B                 1.1x           1.2x        1.7x


On the 10 year historical figures,  we need to be careful as the S&P static 
pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably 
due to prepayment) versus our contracts.  Secondly, the S&P figures have 
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some 
information content.   

I will ask Emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would STRONGLY  suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful 
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right 
architecture for looking at credit in our deals. It is broken, not clear, 
killing our velocity and true capabilities. We also need to look at staffing, 
skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at 
an agenda.

I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market 
implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.  He is 
seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the 
methodology employed in calculating the implied figures.     I will follow 
through and report back.

Hi Iris

I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up-to-date, or were written poorly and under time-pressure, so what do you envisage eventually sending to Duffie?

thanks

Hi Ben,


	I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

	These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to read).

	Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris

This is the rough schedule we came up with at today's video conference:

Submit RFP to D&B, Experian, and Amadeus	2 days		25 Apr		Mumford
Receive back RFPs				 1.5 weeks	4 May		Mumford
Complete evaluation, selection & authorization	1 week		11 May		Mumford/Mack
Contract complete and signed			2 weeks	25 May		Mumford
Data to Iris & Amitava				3 weeks	15 June		Mumford
Model Development Complete			4 weeks	15 July		Mack

Dan sent this information as a follow up to our meeting this week.  If there 
is any additional information you would like to see, please let me know.

In the absense of any objections, I would like to begin having our analysts 
use the Financial Stress score to underwrite small exposures where financial 
statements are not received.  In addtion to saving some expense, this will 
allow greater consistentency.  And moving forward, I believe we can map 
expected defaults from FStress score ranges to those implied in credit 
spreads, and in doing so map to E-ratings for use in credit reserve 
analytics.  I've had prelimiary discussions with Rabi and Amititava regarding 
this.

Any additional insights would be helpful, and thanks for your help.

Mark,

Attached are a presentation on the Financial Stress Score and the countries
that have risk scores available today. Please let me know if you have any
questions.

In response Vince's question regarding false positives from the model, that
is a little difficult to answer.  The model is predicting the likelihood of
a company experiencing financial distress.  We are not saying that all
companies with a high risk score will experience financial distress.  In
other words, it is not really a yes or no proposition.  It' not like a drug
test where the test either comes back positive or negative and ocassionally,
you get a false positive test result.  We are identifying companies that are
at high risk for failure.  Some of those high risk companies will fail and
some will not fail.  How many in each classification that will ultimately
fail is addressed in the performance charts attached below.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or need any additional
information.

Hi Jeff,

	My research colleagues and I are working on a document to lay out our credit derivatives modeling strategy.  For lack of a better term, we refer to this as our credit business plan.

	It is my understanding that various business plans have been previously written for the credit group - one by Gillian Johnson and another by John Bottomley.

	It would be very helpful to our efforts in the research group, it you would allow us to see these plans.

Thanks,
Iris

Dear Mr. Seyfried,

I am following up on the attached message from Vasant Shanbhogue who visited
with us in San Francisco recently.  I will be in London on Friday, March
31st, and would be happy to drop by your offices to provide additional
information on our products.

At this point, the best time for me would be in the late afternoon (2PM to
3PM?).

Please let me know if you would still like to meet and if this time will
work for you.

Regards,

Rob

Hi Robert,

     following up on our visit to your office, Vince Kaminski and I are very
interested in your products. Bryan Seyfried, who is heading up the Credit
Trading operations in London, would like you to visit the London office when
you
are there next Friday.  He would like to discuss technical implementation
details at that time, in addition to the overall framework.  I will also
give
you a call to set up a time to have a more technical (options modeling)
conversation over the phone.

Hi Iris

We started off with about 105 companies, which were Enron Europe's UK power and gas desk counterparties. I'm not sure where you got the figure of 500 from - maybe this is the entire Enron Europe counterparty list, which constitutes the next major effort for end-July.

>From this list of 104, only the 72 in the spreadsheet had information in Amadeus. The other firms had no information available, most likely because they were too new.

Hi again,

	Thanks for the financial data on Enron's European counterparties.

	It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such counterparties.  However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72 of these European counterparties.

	Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400+ other counterparties? 

Thanks so much,
Iris

Hi Iris

The inputs and outputs generated by RiskCalc can be seen in the attached file:

 << File: Data for RiskCalc - 20010323_PD.csv >> 

We only looked at the 5-yr PD.

Inputs are in columns A-U. These are the inputs generated by Amadeus. You can run these inputs through the RiskCalc model over the web (http://www.moodysqra.com/privfirm) using the login: dupred, password: detective. This is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks (Mike Mumford will have more details about the current licence)

Tomas Valnek was getting the data from the Amadeus database, so I'll leave it to him to determine if Houston access is possible. In the meantime you can use the dataset attached for testing purposes.

Subject:	FW: Parent - Subsidary Model

Hi Ben,

	How are you?  Today we had a meeting with Craig Chaney and Jeff Kinneman to discuss the private firm model.

	They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the Moody's Riskcalc model.  I noticed that you also have been looking at RiskCalc - as indicated in your paper entitled "Pricing Parent Companies and their Subsidiaries:  Model Description and Data Requirements"

	Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test statistics, scores, etc.  

	Also, you stated that you used Amadeus database.  We are in the process of trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.  In the mean time, may we have access to the Amadeus database or some sample dataset?

	
Thanks so much,
Iris

Steve,
in order to be able to test the New Credit Model as well as to answer Credit 
Group's 
questions regarding the outputs from this model Research needs to be able to 
do the following:

1. Run Credit Model independently of the other runs. It is quite OK for now 
to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios.
2. Debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time.

Please, let me know if your team can help us.

Unless we can model the protection in some form we will not know what our 
true exposure is.  So I need our team reassessing how we can
model the benefit of the credit proctection.  Please keep working on this.

Subject: Re: Eastern  

John,

We are currently not modelling the effect of insurance on Eastern on an 
individual  risk basis. I have spoken at length with Houston Research & 
Credit Risk Management on this & whilst we can look at the effect of 
protection on the portfolio, there appears to be no viable way of modelling 
protection on a name by name basis; Given that the portfolio of risk is 
dynamic, specific allocation of protection is not appropriate. As I mentioned 
in my earlier message there is $135mm cap on any one loss, assuming no losses 
have occured prior to that.

I am happy to discuss this further with you if required.  

Bill, I'd appreciate any comments you may have re. the above.

Regards,

Soma

How are we modeling the affect of the insurance packages on the Eastern deal?

Subject: Re: Eastern  

The protection is not a fixed allocation of protection to individual 
counterparties but covers the global portfolio of risk. Enron has in place 3 
tranches of credit insurance covering up to $135mm per event. Whilst the 
insurance is not counterparty specific, it would be available for credit loss 
on Eastern provided that losses had not been incurred prior to an Eastern 
loss. I have already discussed with Houston Credit Risk Management & Research 
the possibility of allocation of risk protection on a name basis; at this 
point in time there has been no resolution in finding an appropriate way to 
allocate protection by name.

Summary of insurance:
Enron absorbs the first $10mm of losses in any one year capped at the 
aggregate of $30mm over a ten year period.
AEGIS absorbs the next $35mm of losses for the same ten year period. 
Chubb will pick up the next $50mm losses for any single event and $100mm in 
losses in the aggregate for 5 years
RSA takes the next $50mm for losses in excess of $95mm over a five year 
period & covers the top 9 counterparties by exposure

Regards,

Soma

How does the company's credit insurance (done by Houston last year) affect 
this exposure?

John, as requested:

Total exposure as at 29 Feb 2000:    o620.9mm ($783.2mm)
Eurocash I monetezation:    -o124.7mm (-$196.1mm)
Less credit derivatives:         o40.0mm ($63.1mm)
Total Net Exposure as at 29 Feb 2000:  o456.2mm ($713.9mm) 
Net  month on month increase:    o125.4mm ($197.9mm)

Total Value of Eastern Group Guarantee:  o520mm ($820.6mm)
Amount backed by TXU:    Zero

As well as the increase in overall exposure, please note the change in shape 
of the exposure month on month most notably credit exposure now peaking at 
the front end of the transaction (ex credit derivs. the max exposure is at 
day 1), compare to max. exp. at Feb 2005  for month end Jan.. 
Shape of profile & increase in MtM primarily due to:
 - Power curve downward shift at front end yrs 0-11
 - Power curve upward shift at back end yrs 12-18
 - Gas curve upward shift yrs 1-5.

Hi Ben,


	I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

	These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to read).

	Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris

Bryan,

I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could 
accomplish this from Houston,
but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip 
to London
makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get 
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to 
assess better the usefulness of the
model.

Vince
