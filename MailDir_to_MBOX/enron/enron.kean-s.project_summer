Steve,
Thanks for sending that story. In fact there was a call around that time from 
Bridge News, the wire agency with its Asian headquarters in Mumbai. Post 
discussions with John Ambler I responded as below.
Based on the latest Dow Jones story story today there's just been another 
call from Dow Jones Mumbai which was responded to similarly. Strangely, there 
hasnt been any pick/query from local media - as yet.

Hello Jimmy,

We are given to understand by industry officials that Enron has taken a 
decision to exit from its power, oil and gas businesses internationally.

We would appreciate it if Enron could comment on whether there is any such 
development.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely

There was a call from Anuradha of Dow Jones Mumbai asking to know the India 
perspective of this story below. I  gave her the previously discussed 
response of unable to "comment on market speculation". Though she did press 
that it was beyond speculation now that an unidentified company person had 
confirmed it.

Hi Steve,

The Nigerian barge project is back on course. We have reached definitive 
agreement with the various stakeholders in the Nigerian government without 
giving up much. Right now things look very good and we are looking to have 
the LC signed by next week.

Regards,
Gloria.

Subject: Re: Korean Consents - further  

Mark,

I will look into the point you raise.  It sounds like "Oldco" would be the 
same legal entity that now holds the JV ownership (indirectly).  Enron Corp 
is not defined in terms of individuals.  Thus, it seems there should not be a 
legal issue.  Furhter, the Korean government, has been visited by no less 
than 3 very senior Enron officials within the past year.  A change could make 
officials more reluctant to talk with Enron because the company is constantly 
changing people.  Otherwise, it is hard for me to see why an official would 
want to cause trouble over a "domestic" (within Enron) matter. 

My guess is the challenge would come from SK Corp, who might feel "we" are 
trying to escape without living through the "honeymon" period and not "set 
off" the Right-of-refusal.  There may be a desire to use various techniques, 
including causing political trouble, to force either Newco management or 
Oldco management to buy him out.  Half of the "hurt" they would fall on them 
however, so it would seem there would be a hesitancy to use that approach.  
That would mean that activities of Enron, Korea might be threatened.  So the 
risk seems like it would be dependent on what business, other than CGC joint 
venture, that Enron Korea might get involve in.  Thus far, there isn't an 
active operation being run through EK.   

It is late (or early, actually).  I will consider the point more after some 
sleep.

Mike D.

Thanks.  I think the one dimension that I would like to see addressed a bit 
more explicitly is:  If the interest in the holding company itself is 
transferred, or the management control of the holding company changes hands, 
e.g., "Enron Corp." (old) is no longer chaired by Lay, who will chair "Enron 
Corp. (new)", but Enron Corp. (old) still is the JV interest owner, in 
addition to the legal requiriements, and consultation with locals you note 
below, is there any risk of "political" interference, such that they might 
extract concessions from the parties to the transaction before it could go 
forward.  Not necessarily fair, but they might have some leverage or perceive 
that they do.  If such a transaction goes forward, the dealmakers want to 
know this, so as to be able to fairly judge the risk, and how to allocate it 
in the deal.  thanks  mcs

John,

As per Steve Kean's request, please find attached the documents that I 
currently have on my system.  Hal Means and I are working together to manage 
the flow of documents and to ensure everyone on the Project Teams is on the 
same page.  Therefore, Hal will cross-reference with my documents and send 
you the documents that you are missing.

Please let Hal and me know if you would like a master binder created (it will 
be exactly like the binder that the Project Team currently has).  This would 
ensure that your tabs, and documents within the tabs, would exactly mirror 
the project team's binders.  If so, in the future we will send you additional 
documents indicating which tab it should be inserted after.

Note to Hal Means: Please cross-reference with the attached documents and 
forward any that are not included in this email.

Given the sheer amount of work necessary to complete the Disclosure 
Schedules, how about if we revise our request for completion of drafts of the 
Disclosure Schedules to be by the end of the day on Monday, as oppossed to 
this Friday.  We will of course take the information early. 

I have been informed by Cullen Duke as follows:   that the attached list of 
entites has been compiled by Jan Johnson.  It is based on their Hyperion 
system roll-up of companies for management reporting.  It does include some 
companies that we will not want to transfer.  Accounting and tax are jointly 
combing the list to identify such retained entities.  You may be able to help 
Cullen on identifying such entities.

I will be calling the GCs soon to see about setting up a time to call local 
counsels to confirm our thinking on being able to implement the A,B,C 
structure in the various foreign jurisdictions.  As part of that "call" 
relates to regulatory matters, Rick Shapiro and others will be involved, as 
well as  Bill Weiland, from V&E.  We would like to set up these calls to go 
through the structure and discuss the issues identified with the local 
counsels very soon.  They will obviously need some time to reflect on the 
various issues.  

Again, all remains highly confidential.

Thanks for all the help.  Lance.

As the individual responsible within Enron Corp. for coordinating the 
analysis of regulatory transfer restriction issues in the above-referenced 
project, I wanted to give each of you a brief update, but more importantly, 
ask for your help in ensuring, as we move closer to the signing date, that we 
are fully coordinated on these issues and are prepared to act in a consistent 
and coordinated fashion across the regions as quickly as possible.

Over the last several weeks, the regional general counsel offices, V&E (Bill 
Weiland), Skadden and myself have been talking to local counsel across the 
regions to make sure that we fully understand all of the regulatory transfer 
issues and that we also fully understand the implications of the regulatory 
transfer restrictions in the context of the "ABC" deal structure.  We have 
now largely completed that process and the conclusions reached during that 
process have been memorialized in various documents, including the "ABC 
Matrix" that many, if not all of you, have seen.  All that is remaining is 
confirmation on a South Korean competition agency issue and the completion of 
the analysis relative to the Wind assets in Europe regarding EU competition 
agency issues. Those two items should be completed by early next week.  We 
have also recently begun the process of preparing documents that will be 
necessary for the approval of the transfer of Elektro in Brazil...which 
brings me to the second issue, coordination and preparation.

Having reached a critical juncture with the completition of virtually all of 
the regulatory analysis, the next step is to plan for the announcement of the 
transaction...more specifically, ensuring that regulatory/governmental 
communication assignments for both pre and post announcement are fully agreed 
upon and understood by all... and that the process of drafting the necessary 
requests for regulatory approval documents is agreed upon and begun as soon 
as possible.  To ensure that this all happens in a timely manner and with 
quality, I would like to request that one individual from each operating 
region and company be assigned as the point person so that I can have a 
single individual within each operating unit to go to that has the authority 
to put together the comprehensive regulatory transfer plan and the 
responsibility for assuring the execution of the plan, both during the 
periods of time leading up to signing and announcement and during the 
transition period leading up to closing.  I would respectfully ask that the 
names of these individuals be communicated to me by close of business 
Wednesday, August 16, 2000 to provide us sufficient time to address the work 
that lies before us.  I have taken the liberty of listing my suggestions for 
the responsible individuals (where I have suggestions) for the respective 
operating regions/companies, but these are only suggestions and I will defer 
to your choices.  Thank you for your assistance and if you have any 
questions, feel free to contact me at extension 33407 in Houston or by pager 
at 888-740-9949.

Just so you had the latest matrices; although some of you directly received 
these materials.  I anticipate being able to send you a revised draft of the 
Purchase and Sale Agreement by next Tuesday morning.  No doubt, everything 
will become clear in the next draft - materiality, Subject Companies, 
required Authorizations, etc.  I anticipate circulating a full draft of the 
Schedules by mid next week.  The plan would be to revise the draft schedules 
based on the revised text of the Agreement and your further review of the 
respective businesses generally.  We will also need to keep in mind some 
sense of conformity as to how each unit is making their respective 
disclosures.  The Schedules will not need to win an award for beauty at that 
point, but do need to be well organized and make sense.  I encourage each of 
the General Counsels to coordinate with Mary Joyce on HR matters, Frank Smith 
or Dave Nutt on environmental matters, Cullen Duke on tax matters, Bob 
Williams and Chuck Cheek on litigation matters, Rick Shapiro on regulatory 
matters, and Jim Bouillion on insurance matters, just to make sure nothing 
slips through the cracks.  Timing of course is critical.  The Disclosure 
Schedules may become critical path items, and we may all hear that.    I 
expect there will be great progress generally next week, and there will be 
tremendous pressure to deliver a complete draft of the Schedules to Skadden 
soon after the end of next week.  Your comments would likely need to be in by 
the end of the week - sorry.  Please be aware that the Business Unit heads, 
right before execution of the Agreement, are likely to have to sign-off on 
the disclosures under the Agreement.  Truly, thanks for all the help.  Send 
money or Disclosure Schedules.  Lance.

		 Subject: Project Summer Matrices

Attached please find the latest and greatest ABC matrix and Gty, LC, and 
affiliate contract matrix.  The information has been updated in red by 
comments we have recieved from the EI business units.  The new transfer level 
and sever level info came from the A/B/C structure task force.  (Please note 
that the A/B transfer level is the same as the sever level unless ptherwise 
noted.)  It still needs to be reviewed by both sides.  We are waiting for 
final regulatory issues and action items this weekend after a collaborative 
effort from both sides.  There are still pieces of info in these matrices 
that the deal team needs that are highlighted in blue.  Please fill in TBD to 
the extent you can determine and send it back in green.

Please review both matrices and send changes to Nicole Alvino and Bill 
Gathmann.

Thanks so much for all your help!

Attached is a brief for you to forward on to the State Department.  There have been numerous press articles on the transaction since it was announced and I will forward several for your reference.  We will continue to let the British government take the lead on this (good to know that State agrees with this strategy).  Call me to discuss the brief at 713/853-6973

Subject: Regulatory issues memo: Revised

Enclosed is revised regulatory " issues" memo that  served as the basis for 
discussion at yesterday's regulatory  review  meeting--- the only outstanding 
issue , as I just communicated to Charles Still at Skadden, is confirmation 
of  the fact that there are no antitrust approvals required in South Korea 
relative to SK- that confirmation should be forthcoming from local counsel 
this evening.  Lisa- I assume you will see this gets to Bill Gathmann 
immediately so he can  forward on to regional general counsel for final 
sign-off.

		 Subject: Summer Purchase Agreement


Attached please find clean and marked copies of a revised Purchase and Sale
Agreement.  There are attached copies in WordPerfect 8.0 and in PDF.

Two matters require special mention:

First, we have been advised that the parties discussed a threshhold with
respect to the TGS stamp tax issue of $16 million.  Accordingly, we have
amended the definition of the Excluded Liability to limit it to the excess
of any TGS liability that would yield that amount proportionately to the
Company's ownership interest.

Second, we have noted that the bifurcation of the materiality standard
between materiality as a condition to close and materiality as a condition
to indemnification yields an inappropriate result in the case of the
representation in Section 5.14 dealing with material adverse changes.  It is
our intention to condition the Acquiror's obligation to close on an adverse
matter that is material to a Strategic Business Unit.  It was to indemnify
the Acquiror with respect to an undisclosed adverse matter that is material
to a Strategic Business Unit.  I was not our intention to indemnify the
Acquiror with respect to each $4 million change in each Business not covered
by the other representations.  Accordingly, we have, in the case of Section
5.14, limited the definition of Material Adverse Change to clause (i) of
that definition. <<Houston_284555_1.WPD>>  <<Houston_284243_1.WPD>>

Mark,

I will look into the point you raise.  It sounds like "Oldco" would be the 
same legal entity that now holds the JV ownership (indirectly).  Enron Corp 
is not defined in terms of individuals.  Thus, it seems there should not be a 
legal issue.  Furhter, the Korean government, has been visited by no less 
than 3 very senior Enron officials within the past year.  A change could make 
officials more reluctant to talk with Enron because the company is constantly 
changing people.  Otherwise, it is hard for me to see why an official would 
want to cause trouble over a "domestic" (within Enron) matter. 

My guess is the challenge would come from SK Corp, who might feel "we" are 
trying to escape without living through the "honeymon" period and not "set 
off" the Right-of-refusal.  There may be a desire to use various techniques, 
including causing political trouble, to force either Newco management or 
Oldco management to buy him out.  Half of the "hurt" they would fall on them 
however, so it would seem there would be a hesitancy to use that approach.  
That would mean that activities of Enron, Korea might be threatened.  So the 
risk seems like it would be dependent on what business, other than CGC joint 
venture, that Enron Korea might get involve in.  Thus far, there isn't an 
active operation being run through EK.   

It is late (or early, actually).  I will consider the point more after some 
sleep.

Mike D.

Thanks.  I think the one dimension that I would like to see addressed a bit 
more explicitly is:  If the interest in the holding company itself is 
transferred, or the management control of the holding company changes hands, 
e.g., "Enron Corp." (old) is no longer chaired by Lay, who will chair "Enron 
Corp. (new)", but Enron Corp. (old) still is the JV interest owner, in 
addition to the legal requiriements, and consultation with locals you note 
below, is there any risk of "political" interference, such that they might 
extract concessions from the parties to the transaction before it could go 
forward.  Not necessarily fair, but they might have some leverage or perceive 
that they do.  If such a transaction goes forward, the dealmakers want to 
know this, so as to be able to fairly judge the risk, and how to allocate it 
in the deal.  thanks  mcs

Mark:  Attached is a communications plan for the ESA consolidation that is 
underway as a consequence of the CALME disbandment and final stage efforts to 
sell assets in Brazil and elsewhere.  Jim Bannantine and his senior 
management team have been meeting with the Chairman's Office on the 
consolidation, which included a request for a communication plan for both 
internal and external audiences.  The plan incorporates recommendations from 
a meeting that Jim chaired yesterday and subsequent inputs from his 
management team.  Regards, Keith

Attached is the latest draft of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in both Word 
Perfect and PDF formats.  It still does not cover a number of items several 
of us have discussed, including certain insurance matters.  These items are 
part of an ongoing list of issues.  That list also includes the practical 
applicability of the infamous Section 5.07(b).   

The Disclosure Schedules remain critical.  Please continue to review both the 
parent disclosures and the regional disclosures for gaps, inconsistencies, 
and duplications.  For example, while Corp. Risk Management is scheduling the 
various insurance handled by it, that group is not aware of insurance 
obtained at the local level.  Those policies at the regional level need to be 
listed, as well as checked to confirm that they are not implicated by a 
change of control.  The parent level policies have been reviewed for change 
of control implications.  Also, please confirm that the schedules include all 
claims against the involved entities; for example, there appear to be many 
claims made under the various insurance policies that have not yet become a 
litigation matter.

Timing of the deal could soon become quite ugly.  Thanks for all of the 
help.  Lance.

Richard,

Since the only approvals we need on the "regulatory side" are from FIPB and 
RBI and relate to the Dabhol transaction, I suggest the Ananda Mukerji be the 
point person for these.

Subject: Project Summer/Desert Lightning:Regulatory Transfer Issues

As the individual responsible within Enron Corp. for coordinating the 
analysis of regulatory transfer restriction issues in the above-referenced 
project, I wanted to give each of you a brief update, but more importantly, 
ask for your help in ensuring, as we move closer to the signing date, that we 
are fully coordinated on these issues and are prepared to act in a consistent 
and coordinated fashion across the regions as quickly as possible.

Over the last several weeks, the regional general counsel offices, V&E (Bill 
Weiland), Skadden and myself have been talking to local counsel across the 
regions to make sure that we fully understand all of the regulatory transfer 
issues and that we also fully understand the implications of the regulatory 
transfer restrictions in the context of the "ABC" deal structure.  We have 
now largely completed that process and the conclusions reached during that 
process have been memorialized in various documents, including the "ABC 
Matrix" that many, if not all of you, have seen.  All that is remaining is 
confirmation on a South Korean competition agency issue and the completion of 
the analysis relative to the Wind assets in Europe regarding EU competition 
agency issues. Those two items should be completed by early next week.  We 
have also recently begun the process of preparing documents that will be 
necessary for the approval of the transfer of Elektro in Brazil...which 
brings me to the second issue, coordination and preparation.

Having reached a critical juncture with the completition of virtually all of 
the regulatory analysis, the next step is to plan for the announcement of the 
transaction...more specifically, ensuring that regulatory/governmental 
communication assignments for both pre and post announcement are fully agreed 
upon and understood by all... and that the process of drafting the necessary 
requests for regulatory approval documents is agreed upon and begun as soon 
as possible.  To ensure that this all happens in a timely manner and with 
quality, I would like to request that one individual from each operating 
region and company be assigned as the point person so that I can have a 
single individual within each operating unit to go to that has the authority 
to put together the comprehensive regulatory transfer plan and the 
responsibility for assuring the execution of the plan, both during the 
periods of time leading up to signing and announcement and during the 
transition period leading up to closing.  I would respectfully ask that the 
names of these individuals be communicated to me by close of business 
Wednesday, August 16, 2000 to provide us sufficient time to address the work 
that lies before us.  I have taken the liberty of listing my suggestions for 
the responsible individuals (where I have suggestions) for the respective 
operating regions/companies, but these are only suggestions and I will defer 
to your choices.  Thank you for your assistance and if you have any 
questions, feel free to contact me at extension 33407 in Houston or by pager 
at 888-740-9949.

I've done some research in relation to securing a 1-800 # for Project Summer 
and the following steps will need to be taken if we decide to move forward 
with this:

We must establish where the 1-800 # is going to ring.  For example, it must 
ring through at an assigned 5  digit extension (i.e. similar to all internal 
Enron extensions) that the Enron Move Team will have to create (1 day).

AT&T must be informed of the designated extension # to set up the 1-800 # and 
to electronically route the 1-800 # to that point (typically 10-14 days BUT 
they do offer 1-800 #s for emergencies - i.e. disaster areas - which they can 
set up in 2-3 days).  If we do move forward, I imagine that we will request 
this 2-3 day set up service, since we have already past meeting the 10-14 day 
deadline).

Our internal telephone department must be informed of how many tiers we would 
like on the system for the correct software to be written - this will take 
2-3 days.  For example, I believe we would like callers to have language 
options and business unit options - tier one, may sound as follows: "You have 
reached....press 1 for CALME, press 2 for APACHI, etc."  Then the second tier 
may sound as follows: "...press 1 for Spanish, press 2 for Portugese, etc."

Will we need to recruit staff internally, who represent the required spectrum 
of languages, to listen to the voice mail messages and email the questions to 
the appropriate business unit PR contact for responses?


Overall Timing

Move team = 1 day
AT&T  = 3 days (simultaneously with tiers)
Tiers  = 3 days (simultaneously with AT&T)

Total  = 4 days

 
Overall Cost

AT&T Toll # Cost  = $10.00

AT&T Install   = $10.00

International Long Distance Dialing Minutes (based on country call is placed 
from) = $ Varies

Move team   = few hundred $

Tiers    = couple of thousand $

Total for components = $3,000 + variable international long distance charges 
based on volume of calls


I hope I haven't left anything out...if so, please contact me via email or 
voice mail x 3-5670.  

Cindy

Update - we had a good session today to continue to resolve open issues.  One 
thing that resulted is to have a meeting with management to discuss, among 
other things, management's tranfer plan  for the assets, interim operations 
between signing and closing, operating entities that Enron could be deemed to 
control, disputes with EE&CC, and the purchase and sale agreement and the 
related disclosure schedules.  I believe that the meeting is being set up for 
Wednesday.  I can see how it is imperative that the General Counsels be at 
the meeting, although I am sure I do not control the invitation list.  You 
may want to talk to your business heads.  With this schedule, we are to have 
a good set of disclosure schedules by that date.  The latest plan 
contemplates circulation of the revised purchase and sale agreement and draft 
disclosure schedules by Monday night.  Tuesday would be a day for questions 
in advance of Wednesday's meeting.  Attached is a draft of known open issues 
with EE&CC.   Thanks for all the help.  Lance.

a belated response to my inquiry regarding Project Summer, and our Turkish 
power station.  Do you want me to follow-up on the subsequent inquiry made in 
India and Korea, i.e., will there be "political" costs to be paid, or will 
our deal be held ransom to concessions extracted from us?  thanks mcs

Mark -- while I have not asked our counsel in Ankara to look  into this 
specifically, I have made a couple of discrete enquiries on this front and 
can confirm that the Turkish Gov't would need to be involved in a transfer of 
ownership for Trakya or any kind of re-financing along the lines of Project 
Margeaux.   The MENR and TEAS (elec. company) are the two principals in this 
discussion.   FG

Thanks, when you were looking at this, and I do not see it in the attachment, 
is this question:  are any regulatory approvals required, by Government 
Ministry or Competition Authority, to transfer effective ownership or control 
of the Trakya assets, whether as envisioned in Project Margaux, or by other 
financing that would effectively look like an asset or equity sale?  thanks

This is the information I supplied on regulatory issues as part of the

anything further I can send on the subject...

This draft looks ok to me.  Just to make sure the logic is being transmitted 
to the authors of the communiques, we obvioiusly need to get a pop for the 
investment community from selling assets and increasing return on equity.  At 
the same time we need to communicate to partners, customers and regulators 
that Enron is still there, which is the basis for some of our contracts and 
concessions.  This dual benefit is the main conceptual value in the summer 
deal, if it is done, and needs to guide our communication strategy which will 
inevitably involve the same message going to investors as goes to our 
counterparts in the markets in question.

Dear Steve,

Thank you for taking your time last month.

I have additional questions. I am glad if you give me some suggestions.

First, are there any risk of soaring electricity price and brownouts in
regulated states like Florida or Northwest in the near future, for example
this summer?

Second, I found you mentioned about open access on existing transmission
lines. Who regulates access now in which area?

Third, in San Diego, why have other IPP built new plants and inter-regional
transmission lines even if they expected today's situation? Can I say that
Dynegy and Duke are the winners because they have bought plants from SDG&E?
Do Enron have interest to build new plants in California?

Again, thank you for your cooperations.

Ken Chiba

As requested, I investigated potential government approvals or potential 
political interventions if India assets/investments are sold.  My 
understanding from the India CFO (in response to my query about approvals 
necessary for any sell-down like we are working on for Dabhol) is that it 
depends to whom we sell.  If we sell to an Indian company, then the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) must approve taking dollars out of India.  If a sale is 
made outside India, no Indian approvals are necessary.  There are, however, 
many other approvals that would need to be obtained -- specifically from 
lenders and counterparties pursuant to project documents.  I have not 
analyzed these financial-related approvals.

Attached is the press release that BG intends to put out tomorrow (Wednesday) morning on their purchase of our India exploration and production interests (EOGIL).  The release has been approved by EGEP management and legal, and reviewed by corporate development, investor relations and corporate communications. 

The only area of concern is the paragraph stating "As at 31 March 2001, EOGIL had proforma net assets of $419 million. In the twelve-month period to 31 March, the company's proforma profit after tax was $60 million, on revenue of $160 million." 

However, BG maintains that this sale is classified as a Class 2 transaction and in order to comply with the London Stock Exchange rules, this information must be disclosed in the release.  EGEP indicates that this will not result in any write down.  This is reflected in our Q&As. 

BG plans to file the international version with the London Stock Exchange within the next hour for them to issue the release at 7:00 a.m. London time. They plan to send the Indian version of the release to several Indian reporters several hours later.

Please let me (ext. 66423) know if you have any comments or concerns with the release.  

John

At some point very soon, we need to talk about how the whole range of 
contacts that need to be made in D.C. will be made- Hillings does not know 
about the deal as far as I know. Let's talk before the end of the week. 
Thanks.

Because this whole issue is important to of our projects -Gaza, Guatemala, I 
wanted you to have an idea of the strategies being considered. Nothing is 
definitive, they want to lay our the risks and approaches necessary to 
protect all projects and relationships. If you have any thoughts concerning 
the approach, let me know! I will keep you posted as things unfold.

Subject: Re: Key Contacts in IFIs and OPIC  

Keith
 Following on our conversation, let me propose a couple of guiding factors in 
terms of a communications strategy for summer for Washington.  The overriding 
consideration should be to give OPIC operating flexibility to work with us in 
accomplishing our financing objectives without a lot of scrutiny from others 
around Washington that might be interested in getting political benefit from 
putting OPIC's political management on the hot seat.  We will be meeting with 
OPIC shortly after the announcement to set out the reasons why nothing much 
has changed. Our objective I think around Washington should be to quietly 
inform our friends and other critical players so that no one is surprised by 
learning of the shift and no one considers it to be a big deal.  So I would 
propose that after meeting with OPIC we make the rounds and talk to our 
contacts at State, DOE, Treasury, the Executive Directors at the World Bank 
and the IDB, EXIM and the other agencies as well as the appropriate staffers 
on the Hill that might have cause to comment on OPIC's decisions.  In each 
case we should be laying out the arguments why this transaction makes sense 
and why in the end nothing much has changed.  Hope this helps.  Thanks John

John:  I understand that you are in the know about Summer.  Therefore, could 
I prevail on you to provide me with a list of the names and titles of those 
from the aforementioned groups who we should consider sending a letter to 
inform them of the transaction.  I assume it would be the U.S. Executive 
Director, of World Bank and IDB, plus OPIC President.  You know better than 
me, so I'll stand by.  Your input will be included in a workbook we are 
developing for a major communications rollout plan--both internal and 
external. Thanks, Keith

John: I believe that the stakeholder letter (draft # 2 with inputs from 
messrs Shapiro and Bannantine) should be on the agenda.  Keith
