FERC Approves North Baja Pipe 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project "is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action," the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja.

Williams Orders Pipe for 906 MMcf/d Expansion of Kern 
In an effort to begin expansion of its Kern River natural gas pipeline to more than double what is currently transported, Williams reported that it has ordered more than 700 miles of 36-inch and 42-inch pipe so that the increased capacity can be in place by May 2003. The company said the expansion will provide 906 MMcf/d of additional transportation capacity from Wyoming to California. 
"We're on schedule and moving ahead with plans to begin construction next June,'' said Micheal Dunn, project manager of the Kern River Expansion Project. "This is a significant milestone as we move forward." 
The expansion is expected to cost more than $1 billion and will loop approximately 716 miles of the existing Kern River system, bringing the total amount of gas transported to approximately 1.7 Bcf/d. 
Williams said it plans to file an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early August. The company also said it must still secure the necessary environmental and regulatory approvals, and negotiate rights of way. 
"Over the past three months, we've conducted numerous open houses and meetings with agencies throughout Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and California in preparation for the filing," said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. "We are confident we'll meet our projected in-service date." 
Williams' Kern River Gas Transmission currently operates a 922-mile pipeline that delivers Rocky Mountain and Canadian gas to markets in California, Nevada and Utah. The system has a design capacity of 835 MMcf/d.

Questar Plans WY Storage Project, Pipeline Hub 
Questar Pipeline launched a major pipeline expansion initiative Tuesday in conjunction with plans announced recently to move forward with the eastern portion of its Southern Trails Pipeline to California and in response to strong demand for capacity on several other downstream pipelines, particularly Kern River. Questar also said it is moving forward with plans to build the Rocky Mountain region's first high deliverability salt cavern storage operation, and will attempt to turn its existing pipeline system into a market hub. 
The company is holding three open seasons, including one for the southwest Wyoming storage project, another for a northern pipeline expansion and a third for a southern mainline expansion. 
"We're moving forward with plans to make Questar Pipeline a major trading hub," said Questar President Keith O. Rattie during a conference call on the company's strong first quarter financial results. "Our system already has many of the attributes of a major hub: abundant supply, multiple pipeline interconnections and abundant storage. We're moving ahead with plans to provide parking and loaning, no-notice balancing, wheeling and exchange, etc., which together will increase liquidity and facilitate trading and transportation on and between Questar and the other Rockies export pipes." In addition, the company is expecting to add large amounts of receipt and delivery capacity at multiple points along its system. 
An expansion of its northern system would provide additional deliveries to LDC affiliate Questar Gas at Wasatch Front (up to 180,000 Dth/d is expected), Kern River at Muddy Creek or Painter (potentially 110,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at South Lake (30,000 Dth/d), and Wyoming Interstate Company, Overthrust Pipeline, Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Williams Central (50,000 Dth/d deliveries and up to 200,000 Dth/d of receipts at Wamsutter). The exact size of the project will be determined after the open season, which closes May 18. 
The southern system expansion will provide additional capacity from northern and southern receipt points to Kern River (ML104) at Elberta (potentially 300,000-400,000 Dth/d), TransColorado at Greasewood (40,000-60,000 Dth/d), Northwest Pipeline at Red Wash (80,000 Dth/d) and Questar Gas at the Wasatch Front. The transportation charges are as follows: reservation charge is $5.28804/Dth/month, the usage charge is $0.00267/Dth, the 100% load factor rate is $0.17652/Dth, the ACA charge is $0.00219/Dth and the fuel reimbursement charge is 0.8 %. Both projects are expected to be in service by Nov. 1, 2002. 
"There are a lot of customers that have signed up for capacity on other pipelines that are interested in getting gas supplies to those pipelines," said Alan Allred, vice president of business development for Questar Pipeline. "There also are a lot of producers who are developing new supplies and are interested in getting their supplies moved. Questar Pipeline is fortunate to sit right in the middle of the Rockies in this producing area with growing production and also to be interconnected to most of the major pipelines in the West. We've seen open seasons on Kern River, Northwest Pipeline and CIG for its new pipeline (Ruby) going to California. All of that has prompted a lot of interest in moving gas across our system. 
"With the current [high] prices for gas and [strong] demand for gas, I think every available drilling rig we know of in the various basins is producing," he added. "Certainly the Powder River [Basin] is producing a lot. We have the Emory coal-seam in Utah that's producing a lot of gas. There's drilling going on all around our pipeline: the Jonah area, the Mesa-Pinedale areas. And on the other end, there's a lot of demand in California." He also noted there are multiple gas-fired power plants being constructed around Denver and in Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and in California, all of which could be served by Questar's pipeline and its new high-deliverability storage project. 
Questar's Rattie said the Wyoming Salt Cavern Storage Project is expected to be ready for service in June 2004, but partial service could be ready in 2003. The project, which will be located in Uinta County, WY, will include four 3.5 Bcf salt caverns, each capable of up to 12 cycles per year. "That is ideal for peaking power and other flexible services," he said. "This will make high deliverability multi-cycle, salt-based storage available for the first time for customers connected to the long-haul pipes out of the Rockies." 
The proposed storage project near Evanston, WY, will provide firm storage service with interconnects to Questar Pipeline, Williams Pipeline-West (Kern River and Northwest Pipeline), Overthrust Pipeline and Overland Trails Pipeline. Ultimate maximum storage capability is expected to be 14 Bcf. Depending on market support, caverns will be developed on a sequential or concurrent basis. The open season for the storage project will close on June 1, 2001. To determine rates, Questar said it will evaluate the working gas quantity requested, the anticipated shipper utilization patterns and the facilities required to complete the project. It anticipates that the price of these services will be $4.00/Dth/year plus usage charges, ACA, fuel reimbursement or any other applicable charges. For a shipper cycling its storage 12 times per year, this equates to $0.333/Dth/cycle.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index=20
published : May 17, 2001
FERC Approves North Baja Pipeline=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission set its seal, pending environmenta=
l review, on another westward-bound pipeline project Wednesday. The North B=
aja Pipeline will carry up to 500 MMcf/d from a connection with El Paso Nat=
ural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ to fuel power plants and gas distribution syste=
ms in Northern Mexico and Southern California.=20
FERC approved a preliminary determination for the U.S. portion of the 215-m=
ile pipeline, an 80-mile segment that connects at the international border =
between Yuma, AZ and Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. The Mexican governm=
ent has already issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy Internation=
al for the 135-mile Mexican segment, Gasoducto Bajanorte, which will connec=
t with the existing Transportadora de Gas Natural in Mexico. The U.S. porti=
on of the project is owned by PG&E Gas Transmission Holdings Corp., and is =
expected to cost about $146 million. Proxima Gas SA de CV also has an inter=
est in the pipeline.=20
The pipeline has precedent agreements with six shippers for the total capac=
ity. The largest share of the supplies, 283 MMcf/d will go to three power p=
lants, La Rosita/ InterGen plant in Mexicali, the Otay Mesa Plant in San Di=
ego and the Presidente Juarez/Rosarito plant in Tiajuna. The Mexicali plant=
 will export a portion of its power production to California. The Comision =
Federal de Electricidad (CFE) has a call on 32 MMcf/d, increasing to 210 MM=
cf/d and Termoelectica De Mexicali, S. de R.L. de CV has signed on for 105 =
MMcf/d. North Baja maintains that additional demand is likely to develop in=
 the near future, noting the CFE's preference for gas-fueled electric power=
. The CFE plans to convert 11 oil-fired electric generation plants to natur=
al gas within the next 10 years.=20
The pipeline also pointed to other electric generation plant customers on t=
he U.S. western grid and in Mexico, such as the certified 500 MW Blythe Ene=
rgy plant near Blythe, CA, the 500 MW Yucca plant in Yuma, AZ, the planned =
470 MW plant in San Luis Rio de Colorado, Mexico, a planned 250 MW Energia =
de Mexicali or AEP plant, and a future 500 MW plant listed as the Sempra En=
ergy Project in Mexicali.=20
The Commission noted "both the electric grid and natural gas system in Baja=
 California are interconnected with the respective networks in California."=
 Also, the only sources of natural gas currently feeding Baja California ar=
e San Diego Gas & Electric's pipeline which is interconnected with Mexico's=
 Transportadora pipeline and SoCalGas' distribution line into Mexicali. Nor=
th Baja said both lines are constrained and cannot take on the additional p=
ower plant load.=20
FERC dismissed complaints by existing El Paso customers that approving the =
new pipeline would jeopardize their own capacity and upstream supplies. Exi=
sting customers on El Paso are protected by the right of first refusal to c=
ontinue their current contracts, the Commission said, and the North Baja sh=
ippers also have assumed the risk of acquiring their own upstream supplies.=
 The new shippers can obtain released capacity or capacity from expiring co=
ntracts on El Paso, or service from marketers that have firm capacity on th=
e pipeline or from expansion proposals by El Paso. Some of the shippers alr=
eady have signed on for some of the 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity being released by=
 El Paso Merchant Energy at the end of this month. El Paso also is planning=
 a 230 MMcf/d expansion and is assessing further expansions. "The Commissio=
n believes that the North Baja shippers will have realistic opportunities t=
o complete any unfinished upstream arrangements without adversely impacting=
 El Paso's existing customers."=20

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

El Paso Merchant Declines ROFR Opportunity
El Paso Merchant Energy, declining to match bids for about one-third of the capacity on its affiliate El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline into California, "passed up a short-term profit" (and more controversy) to focus on "building our long-term relationship with our California customers," according to spokesman Mel Scott. 
The Merchant Energy arm of El Paso, did, however, pick up 270 MMcf/d or 22% of the 1.22 Bcf/d awarded to 30 bidders earlier this week (see Daily GPI, Feb. 28 <d20010228f.html>). It was the largest slice, but not much above awards to three other large capacity winners. 
"We just decided we don't want to spend our energies dealing with the problems," that have plagued the company lately regarding use of the capacity by its affiliate, Scott said. "We've been made a scapegoat. We're even getting calls from residentials. Their utilities have told them we're to blame for the high prices. We're delivering all the gas that California can take. We're not withholding capacity. There's no way you can hide capacity on a pipeline. But, you can't explain that to a California TV station. They just don't understand how the system works." 
Scott also pointed out that El Paso delivers about 3 Bcf/d out of the average 8 Bcf/d of natural gas that California uses. "There are other pipelines, but they seem to focus on us." 
El Paso has not disclosed the total price to be paid under new contracts for the capacity, which is to start flowing June 1. The winning bids were at tariff rates for a minimum of five years, with El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric collecting the largest shares. As the current holder of the capacity under a contract that expires May 31, El Paso Merchant had the right-of-first-refusal, which allowed it to match and pre-empt the winning bids, if it chose to do so. It did not and the ROFR period has now expired. Bids totaling 14.4 Bcf/d were received, making it necessary to prorate capacity. 
Given the large volume of bids, El Paso also is considering expanding its pipeline and expects to hold an open season, although no date has been set, Scott said. The company also is considering FERC's suggestion that it expand its project to convert the existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline it is acquiring from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. into new capacity for California In the meantime El Paso Energy is conducting an open season to determine interest for six prospective LNG terminals - at least one and possibly two of which would be on the West Coast. The company said it is prepared to spend $1.5 billion over the next five years on the projects (see Daily GPI, Feb. 6 <d20010206c.html>).

Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that "with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade." Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that "unconventional gas" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in "tight" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas "is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions." At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that "if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade." 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the "project definition phase," or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it "recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas."

Gas Pipeline Rush is Alive, Well in NW 
Nature's severe downturn in the amounts of hydroelectricity in the western region over the past 12 months has been a giant wake-up call for natural gas as new gas-fired power plants are spurring an unprecedented rush to build added interstate pipeline transmission into Washington and Oregon. 
PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) announced it has new binding precedent agreements with 25-year terms totaling about 250 MMcf/d based on a open season concluded in mid-June in the Pacific Northwest. This is for an expansion in 2003 and is in addition to earlier announced expansions for next year, which are currently pending before the FERC and will add about 200 MMcf/d of firm capacity to the system. New power generation makes up almost all the growth to be served by the expansions. 
Williams' Northwest Pipeline last week announced yet another expansion--its fourth in less than a year--in the state of Washington, all involving proposed new electric generating plants and collectively representing hundreds of millions of new daily capacity into a state that used little other than wood and hydroelectric energy until the last few decades of the 20th Century. Besides the recently announced $200 million, 276-MMcf/d, 26-mile Evergreen Pipeline expansion to fuel several new power plants in western Washington, Northwest already is pushing ahead with plans for three other pipeline expansions: 
Nine miles of 20-inch diameter pipeline, the Everett Delta Project, will be completed in August 2002, bringing 86 MMcf/d of new gas supplies to fuel a power plant under construction by an affiliate of Florida Power and Light, FPL Energy, in the fastest growing area in the state, Snohomish County, on former industrial property owned by Weyerhaeuser. 
A 50-mile expansion, the Grays Harbor Lateral, in the area around the state capital of Olympia, WA, to serve a 600 MW combined-cycle power plant (Satsop Development Park) Duke Energy intends to build. The $75 million project is schedule to be completed in November 2002. 
The Georgia Strait Project in far northwest Washington will extend underwater to Vancouver Island in British Columbia. It includes 84 miles of new pipeline to two new power plants slated to be built. The $159 million expansion and joint effort between Northwest and BC Hydro is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2003; federal approvals on both sides of the Canadian border were applied for last spring. 
Underscoring this effort by Williams and the similar proposed expansions by PG&E GTN is the well-recognized fact that the Pacific Northwest historically relied too heavily on one energy source--hydro. Officials at the Northwest Power Planning Council and within the individual energy companies headquartered in the region are now hooked on new gas-fired generation as are all of the western states. 
"The overwhelming reason for high power prices is scarcity, borne largely from sharply higher-than-expected demand growth, and the savage downturn in hydroelectricity supplies," wrote energy consultants Samuel A. Van Vactor and Frederick Pickel in a technical article on deregulation published earlier this year.

PG&E Eyes Backbone, Storage Expansions as Part of Gas Accord II 
Overlooking for the time being its current financial position, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is eyeing in-state gas transportation and storage expansions in California to help alleviate the current strain on the system and prevent likely future curtailments during peak summer demand periods, a utility official said last week. 
At a FERC technical conference on California Gas Transportation Infrastructure (Docket PL01-4), PG&E's Dan Thomas, director of products and sales for California Gas Transmission, said the utility's intrastate pipeline will hold an open season in June for 1.2 Bcf/d of "backbone" capacity, including 200 MMcf/d of new Redwood Path expansion capacity that will become available in July 2002. 
"The rate impact of capacity/infrastructure investments is small relative to the commodity price exposure," he said. PG&E intends to make its expansion plans part of Gas Accord II, another comprehensive regulatory proceeding the utility plans to begin at the California Public Utility Commission next month. 
Thomas said PG&E's transmission and storage capacity is adequate to meet projected 2001 gas demands without curtailments, but the utility expects "very high load factors through the upcoming summer and winter." It also is expecting continued high gas prices and potential for price spikes due to those high load factors. 
A large part of the problem this summer will be the smaller contribution of hydroelectric generation into the mix. The state's gas-fired generation plants will continue to be used to their fullest potential, straining the transportation system when combined with summer storage injections. Throughput will be much closer to maximum capacity this summer than last, according to Thomas. Throughput will easily exceed 3 Bcf/d during the spring, summer and fall, in contrast to last summer, in which throughput hovered around 2.6 Bcf/d. 
The system will need additional firm transportation and storage capacity in the next few years, Thomas said. PG&E is expecting to add 200-500 MMcf/d of Redwood and Baja capacity and 200-400 MMcf/d of new storage withdrawal capacity in the next three to five years. The company also is planning some local transmission enhancements to improve reliability for electric generation. 
"For $100 million we could expand [the Redwood Path, from Malin, OR, south] by 500 MMcf/d, which is somewhere between 10-and-11 cents/Dth for the expansion --- the current rate is about 27 cents." Expanding the Baja Path from the southwestern market points (connections with Kern River, Transwestern and El Paso) would be more expensive --- about $400 million to add 200 MMcf/d from Topock, AZ; expansion from Bakersfield or Daggett to the Bay Area would cost a little less. 
However, the volatility associated with power generation is likely to get much worse. In the past, summer demand fluctuated about 230 MMcf/d. The forecast, however, shows summer fluctuations exceeding 450 MMcf/d. In the past, PG&E used heating degree days to forecasts its peak needs as a planning guide for capacity additions, but in the future it might be wiser to use cooling degree days during a dry summer as a planning guide to gauge capacity requirements, he said. Summer backbone throughput is expected to exceed 3 Bcf/d with a significant and growing portion represented by volatile generation demand, compared to winter backbone transmission throughput forecast at a steady 2.5 Bcf/d. 
"Maintaining a reserve margin above dry-year demands will: account for difficulty in forecasting [generation] demand; accommodate potential for supply disruptions/limitations; provide market flexibility in the use of storage; help to avoid commodity price spikes; and provide flexibility to manage daily demand fluctuations." He also noted that the cost of providing the reserve margin is significantly less than the commodity cost increases in times of shortage. 
To maintain a minimum 10% reserve margin in backbone capacity, PG&E will need to add 133 MMcf/d in 2003, 148 in 2004, 137 in 2005, 176 in 2006 and 218 MMcf/d of firm space in 2007, Thomas said. 
PG&E's core load also requires additional peaking storage capacity of about 200-400 MMcf/d, which would cost $15 million to $50 million, he said. The storage expansion would depend on a $60 million installation of a new pipeline, Line 57C from the McDonald Island storage field.

CIG Plans New Line From Rockies to Midcontinent 
Colorado Interstate Gas has announced an open season running through July 20 for a new pipeline to transport Rocky Mountain gas from the Cheyenne Hub to connections in the Midcontinent area near Greensburg, KS. 
CIG said it has completed the archaeological, environmental and right-of-way surveys necessary to file an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by this coming October and complete the pipeline by late 2003. The company said it "has been working with interested shippers in developing this pipeline project over the past year in response to concerns that Rocky Mountain gas supplies could exceed pipeline takeaway capacity." 
The line would consist of 380 miles of 30-inch pipe and 17,000 hp of compression to carry about 540 MDth/d of gas. Planned interconnects include ANR Pipeline, CMS Panhandle Eastern, Northern Natural Gas, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Williams. 
Based on the current design, the transport rate would be 28 cents/Dth, plus an estimated 0.8% fuel and unaccounted for gas, and any authorized surcharges such as an ACA charge. Prospective shippers are asked to complete an offer sheet for a 10-year contract, stating their maximum daily quantity, receipt and delivery points, acceptance of the 100% load factor rate of 28 cents/Dth, and any other conditions required of the shipper. 
CIG will notify winning bidders by July 23 and execute binding precedent agreements for firm transportation by Aug. 17, 2001. At that point CIG will evaluate all precedent agreements to determine if the project is economically viable. Contacts are Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387 or Laine Lobban at (719) 520-4344.

Susan,
 
Thank you for your  time on the phone today and for requesting more information on our new  study.  I have attached the brochure to this email for you to review.   This should help to give you a better idea of the detail involved. This study is  expected to give some new insight into the gas transmission industry.  Our  gas consulting team has been hard at work on this project for the last 6 months,  so there has been an abundance of work put into this  analysis.
 
The price of the  study is $9,000. However, Enron does qualify  for a 30% discount, which would drop your price to $6,300. If you decide you need this study, and if you  can give me an OK this month, I will include  a free copy of our North American Natural Gas System wall map (reg.  $495).
 
Please review the  attachment, and if you have any further questions, or if you do want to accept  the offer, please feel free to contact me at (720) 548-5496.
 
Sincerely,
Chuck Van Note

SoCalGas to Make System Enhancements
Southern California Gas Co. confirmed plans to expand its intrastate gas transportation 
system and make enhancements to its storage facilities to help meet record-setting gas
 demand by electric generators in Southern California. SoCalGas Chairman Edwin A. Guiles
 informed California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch of the plans in a March 27 letter. 

He said the company had begun modifications to its system that will allow it to deliver an
 additional 175 MMcf/d by year end. SoCal's Lad Lorenz told NGI last week the company
 was planning to increase receipt point capacity at Wheeler Ridge where it interconnects
 with Kern River and Mojave, at the Needles compressor station where it interconnects 
with Transwestern Pipeline and at a receipt point for in-state production in the San Joaquin 
Valley (see Daily GPI, March 23). The Topock, AZ, border delivery point, which saw the 
sharpest price increases this winter, was not among the points slated for expansion because 
of the cost of expanding there. The company plans to add 85 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler
 Ridge, 50 MMcf/d at Needles and 40 MMcf/d for in-state production. 

"We are taking immediate action to increase compression horsepower at three delivery
 stations to boost the amount of natural gas that can be transported into The Gas Company's
 intrastate pipeline system," said Guiles. "In light of the uncertainties surrounding future demand
 for natural gas on The Gas Company's system, these modifications are the least cost way that
 we can be assured of meeting the gas demands of all of our customers and avoid any possibility
 for curtailments of service." Guiles said the proposed 5% increase in capacity would be enough 
to serve another 1.3 million residential customers per day or to power 1,200 MW of new baseload
 electric generation. 

"The improvements are consistent with SoCalGas' goals of maintaining as much as 20% more 
capacity than our requirements for periods of normal demand," he said. 

SoCalGas also is proposing some adjustments to its gas storage operations that will help increase
 the in-state supply of natural gas by 24 Bcf - or enough gas to serve a half million residential 
customers for one year - over the next year. It already has on file at the CPUC plans to abandon
 the Montebello storage field in Los Angeles County and withdraw the 10-12 Bcf of base and working
 gas that remains in the field. In addition, the company is planning to drill several new wells at its 
Aliso Canyon and La Goleta storage fields in order to remove 14 Bcf of base gas, split evenly 
between the two fields, and sell it into the market. The reduction in base gas is expected to have 
no impact on the amount of working gas capacity available in each field. 

Because of strong gas demand last summer, the levels of natural gas at the company's underground
 storage reservoirs reached near historic lows this winter. The LDC is encouraging non-core shippers 
to get a head start on storage injections this year because it expects demand to remain strong in 2001. 

"Our goal for this year is to have no curtailments of gas service to our customers, but we need to maximize 
the use of our existing intrastate capacity in order to reach our goal," said Guiles. "We're telling our large 
industrial and electric generation customers that the best way that they can avoid curtailments next winter 
is to make full use of the available pipeline space and put natural gas in storage whenever possible, 
particularly during the second quarter of this year. 

"I believe that, if undertaken, these proposals will have a positive impact on reliability next winter," said Guiles.

Kevin,
 
I'm sorry, Kevin.  I didn't realize the report was that long!  Here is a little synopsis.  I hope this helps you.  I haven't had time to read the report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it your way.

CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices 
Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. 
It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. "Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California," the report stated. 
Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more "independent" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully "optimize" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. 
As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet "growing demand in California and throughout the West." If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. 
For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are "key indicators" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. 
The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new "design criteria and reliability standards" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls "the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a "natural gas curtailment scheme" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. 
The 111-page report, "Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues," prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. 
As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is "fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage.

Kinder Morgan Rolls: Snags Pipeline, Doubles 2Q Earnings 
There's good news and then there's better news. For Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), every day just seems to be a front-page top-of-the-fold story. Take Wednesday, for instance. Delivering on projections made earlier this month that it would meet or beat consensus earnings estimates, KMI reported great news, with a 107% boost in second quarter earnings over the same period a year ago, and year-to-date earnings up 42%. However, KMI's general limited partner Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. (KMP) almost trumped the broadcast, with its announcement that it would buy a 2,600-mile Texas natural gas pipeline system for $360 million and split its stock two for one. 
KMI's net income for the quarter was $49.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, compared with $24.1 million, or $0.21 for the same period of 2000. During a conference call with investors, CEO Richard Kinder said earnings were driven by its pipeline partner KMP whose earnings "more than doubled compared to the second quarter a year ago," adding that would be "hard to imagine we could have had a much better quarter." Calling KMP the "real driver of the real growth," Kinder said that "while no company can escape economic downturn, KMI is about as minimally exposed as possible." 
Kinder, who said the company is still on track to make additional acquisitions or growth plans before the end of the year, also hinted that another pipeline expansion announcement could be forthcoming. KMP, he said, is in discussions about a "major expansion in the Rockies." Although the West Coast is on most companies' radar screens for pipe growth, Kinder said he thought that a possible pipeline expansion "should go east, but we're just talking." Calling production thus far in the Rocky Mountain basin "a great story," Kinder said the company had "major advantages, and it looks pretty good so far." He did not detail when any announcements may be made. 
KMP's newest pipeline deal, with an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corp., includes pipe that primarily transports gas from South Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast region to the greater Houston/Beaumont area, a "very good growth market," Kinder said. The assets are currently leased and operated by KMP as a major part of the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (KMTP) business unit. KMP also signed a five-year agreement to supply almost 90 Bcf of natural gas to chemical facilities owned by Occidental affiliates in the Houston area. 
With KMP's earnings tied into KMI's, Kinder said that "as the operator, we are very familiar with the assets involved in this transaction and their excellent growth potential." The transaction, expected to close in the third quarter, is expected to be immediately accretive to per-unit distributions by about $0.08 annually. Under the lease terms, KMP will pay $40 million annually from 2002 through 2005 and $30 million annually through 2026. 
On track to deliver more than a 40% increase in earnings per share this year, Kinder pointed to KMI's "premier, fee-based portfolio of midstream assets," adding that KMI was "comfortable" with current 2001 consensus earnings estimates of $1.84 per share, but said KMI would raise its 2002 estimate to between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. 
Breaking down its earnings by business segment, Kinder said KMI will receive $67 million in total cash distributions from KMP for the second quarter of 2001, up 81% from $37 million a year ago. "As KMP's cash flow grows, KMI's general partner share of that cash flow grows dramatically," he said. "KMI's cash flow from KMP increased significantly due to internal growth in KMP's pipeline and terminal segments and the strong performance of recent KMP acquisitions." After equity accounting and amortization, KMP contributed $60.5 million of pre-tax earnings to KMI in the second quarter, up from $28.3 million a year ago. 
The Product Pipelines segment delivered a 57% increase in earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of $101.8 million in the second quarter, compared to $65.0 million during the same period a year ago. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment produced segment earnings before DD&A of $39.6 million, a 24% increase, which reflected strong earnings growth from Red Cedar Gathering Company and the inclusion of additional gas assets that were transferred from KMI to KMP at the end of 2000. "Adding Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline to this segment has made our gas pipeline business more seasonal, shifting more of the segment's income to the first and fourth quarters," Kinder explained. "For this reason, the year-to-date increase of 56% in segment earnings before DD&A is more representative than a second quarter comparison." 
Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), a KMI subsidiary, earned $80.3 million in the quarter, up from $80 million in the second quarter of 2000. NGPL benefited, said Kinder, from its "successful recontracting of its long-haul transportation and storage capacity," adding that the subsidiary expects to add approximately 3,000-4000 MW of gas-fired capacity annually through 2004, "which should boost demand." 
Power earnings surged, recording $18.8 million, compared with $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2000--a 119% jump, which the company attributed to growth in fee-income associated with gas-fired power plant development. Two 550 MW plants, expected to come online in the second quarter of 2002, are under construction in Little Rock, AR, and Jackson, MI. "Both of those are on schedule and on budget," Kinder said. 
Retail was the only segment that was down, but Kinder offered a positive spin on this as well. With earnings down $2.2 million from a year earlier, he noted that earnings in the second quarter of 2000 were boosted because of an earlier than normal, high-demand irrigation season. "However, it's precisely that type of volatility that led us to initiate a weather hedging program in late 2000 to normalize our summer-irrigation and winter-heating load. With our hedging now in place, Retail earnings are up 6% year-to-date, and we remain confident that Retail will deliver approximately 10% growth in segment earnings this year." 
By itself, KMP, the largest pipeline master limited partnership in the United States, had a record quarter, with every business segment producing increased cash flow and earnings. "Our results reflect both excellent internal growth and outstanding performance by recently acquired pipeline and terminal assets," said Kinder. KMP declared a second quarter distribution of $1.05 (an annualized rate of $4.20) per unit, that will be payable Aug. 14 to unitholders of record as of July 31. The distribution is 24% higher than the distribution of $0.85 per unit paid for the second quarter of 2000.The two for one stock split will be distributed on Aug. 31 to holders of record on Aug. 17. 
This is the second time that KMP has split the units since its formation in February 1997, Kinder noted. "Since then, KMP has turned over almost 600% to its unitholders." KMP reported record quarterly net income of $104.2 million, or $0.72 per unit, versus $71.8 million, or $0.70 per unit, in the second quarter of 2000.

Report Pessimistic on Planned Power Plants 
Less than half of the electric power plants now in development in the United States are likely to be completed, according to an analysis of electricity and natural gas supply and demand by an energy analyst with the Williams Capital Group LP, a New York-based investment bank. 
While those new facilities that actually do get built will ease tight power markets and alleviate political pressures to control prices in the near term, high gas prices and electricity price volatility are likely to continue, according to Christopher Ellinghaus, an energy analyst with Williams Capital. Only if new coal-fired or nuclear power plants come on line in significant numbers, are shortages likely to be abated, the analysis noted. But Ellinghaus pointed out that bringing new coal-fired or nuclear power plants on line at any significant level cannot happen until 2005. 
Although independent power producers and other electricity suppliers hope to have 300,000 MW of new generating capacity on line by 2005, it is doubtful that much more than 100,000 MW will be possible over the next three years, Ellinghaus asserted. He attributed the difference to infrastructure constraints, including U.S. energy policy, public attitudes toward new facilities and anemic growth of natural gas supplies, the fuel to be used in over 90% of the proposed plants. 
Pointing out that gas supplies have been growing by less than 1% annually despite record drilling activity, Ellinghaus warned that unless unprecedented amounts of new, net gas production emerge over the next three to five years, only a fraction, perhaps 40% to 45%, of the natural gas-fired plants currently being developed will actually be constructed. 
Demand for electricity is likely to grow by 3% annually through 2010, Ellinghaus forecasted. That rate reflects the fundamental shift in the U.S. economy that has made electricity-intensive technologies such as computers, telecommunications and the Internet the engines of U.S. economic growth. 
To meet this demand and build sufficient reserves to avoid price shocks, U.S. power generators would have to build 330,000 MW of new and replacement capacity by 2010, a 41.7% increase from the 822,000 MW of capacity in 2000. If all the new plants were gas fired, demand for natural gas would grow by between 11 and 15 Tcf, requiring the gas market to grow from 22.4 Tcf to between 33 and 38 Tcf. 
The analyst said that in order to meet that demand, natural gas supply would have to increase by 9% annually. Based on production experience over the last decade, it is doubtful that such a level of increased production could be achieved, Ellinghaus said. Most gas exploration and production analysts expect an annual growth rate in the 1% to 3% range. 
There will be adequate gas supply to the fuel new plants being built this year and next, when 43,000 MW and 36,000 MW of new generating capacity are expected to come on line, Ellinghaus said. However, in subsequent years there only would be enough gas supply to support 20,000 MW of new plant construction. "Natural gas remains the principal constraint to completing and operating plants currently in development." 
As a consequence of insufficient gas supplies, power generators would have to build 200,000 MW of generating capacity fueled by coal or uranium to meet long-term demand, Ellinghaus stated. However, because of the lengthy development cycle and public policy concerns, new plants relying on these energy sources will not begin to come on line in sufficient numbers until 2005 or 2006..

Williams Files Evergreen Expansion Project 
SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) announced today that it has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the Evergreen Expansion Project in the state of Washington. The proposed $240 million project is designed to expand Williams' existing Northwest Pipeline system from Sumas to Chehalis, Wash., (Sumas-Chehalis Corridor) to meet the demands of new electric generation facilities and to provide additional capacity in the Plymouth to Washougal, Wash., corridor (Columbia River Gorge Corridor) for existing firm shippers. 
The Evergreen Expansion Project will add 67,000 additional horsepower at five compressor stations and four sections of new pipeline loops, totaling 28 miles, in the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor. The new pipeline segments will generally be placed in existing right of way, parallel to Northwest's natural gas transmission system. To increase north flow capacity for existing firm shippers, 24,000 additional horsepower will also be installed at five compressor stations located within the Columbia River Gorge Corridor. 
"The additional 276,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas delivered by the Evergreen Expansion Project for the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor will supply the fuel needed for five new power plants in the state of Washington," said Greg Snow, project manager of business development Williams' Northwest system. "This gas will supply the fuel for power plants to generate 1,900 megawatts of electricity, which can serve approximately two million homes. In addition, the 54,000 dekatherms of additional capacity through the Columbia River Gorge Corridor will reduce existing firm shippers' reliance on displacement capacity." 
Pending FERC approval, construction on the Evergreen Expansion Project is scheduled to commence the summer of 2002, with in-service dates of June 2003 for the Sumas-Chehalis Corridor capacity and November 2003 for the additional Columbia River Gorge capacity." With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. Northwest Pipeline operates a 3,964-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado. The system has a design capacity of 2.9 billion cubic feet per day.

Pipes on the Way for Constrained Rockies 
As natural gas prices in the Rocky Mountain region over the last few months have fallen much further than other areas of the country due primarily to transportation constraints, the question becomes, why is the region currently experiencing a frenzy of exploration and production activity, when pricing signals point toward restraint? The answer, according to Raymond James & Associates analyst Wayne Andrews, is that new pipeline infrastructure is on its way to the region, and in a big hurry. 
"While Henry Hub gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $4/Mcf, Rocky Mountain gas prices have fallen from the mid $7/Mcf range to below $3/Mcf," Andrews said in the company's Stat of the Week report. "This basis pricing differential between the Rockies and other areas has widened considerably as pipeline limitations have created a gas supply chain bottleneck." 
Andrews explained that the Rockies/Henry Hub differential has historically widened during the summer months, and narrowed during the winter when gas demand is at its peak. The fluctuation occurs because midstream companies can charge higher transportation rates when demand is low, forcing producers to realize a discount price for their gas. 
"Nevertheless, prior to 2000, increasing export capacity from the Rockies and modest volume increases kept the differential below $0.50/MMBtu," Andrews said. "More recently, however, the boom in drilling activity during the past several years has caused production out of the region to outpace additions to infrastructure, effectively amplifying the differential problem. In fact, the Rockies/Henry Hub differential peaked near $1.30/MMBtu last summer before receding during the winter months, and has already reached that level again this summer. Consequently, some Rocky Mountain natural gas producers may not be able to meet expectations for earnings and cash flow because they are realizing lower prices." 
But studies have shown that the area is large and filled with precious long-life reserves, and once adequate pipeline infrastructure is in place, the exploration and production (E&P) companies in the region will be able to produce at capacity. 
Andrews suggested that while many analysts normally take the conservative route regarding natural gas price assumptions, many this year did not take into account such a wide basis differential. In the near term, the analyst advises production companies in the area to hedge production and/or the basis differential when the pricing environment is favorable. He also said that locking in firm transportation capacity agreements to erase seasonal peaks and valleys in the differential can also help. 
As for the long run, Andrews said that midstream pipeline expansion in the Rockies will "ultimately eliminate the differential problem." According to the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), more than nine new and expansion projects totaling over 3 Bcf of incremental capacity are currently expected to be complete before November 2003, with four additional projects with unreleased in-service dates. 
To accommodate the growing Powder River Basin production, Fort Union Gas Gathering LLC announced plans in January for a 200 MMcf/d expansion of capacity on its system (see Daily GPI, Jan. 18 <d20010118h.html>). IPAMS said the company now expects to be finished with the expansion ahead of schedule this month, as opposed to the company's previous expectations of the fourth quarter. 
Also jumping into the fray, Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) and BP America Inc. reported on Monday that they have entered into a 12-year agreement to expand gathering and processing infrastructure and services to accommodate BP's Greater Green River Basin drilling program in Wamsutter, WY (see related story this issue). 
"Overall, this expanded infrastructure will enable new gas supplies to be delivered to consumers within the Midwest market areas," said Steve Blossom, asset manager for BP. 
"The bottom line is that widening Rockies/Henry Hub basis differentials will likely prove to be a short-term, seasonal issue and not have a material longer-term effect on activity or company valuations in the Rockies," Andrews said. "That being said, the potential for those basis differentials to remain large or even widen further, increases the possibility of some producers falling short of their earnings estimates in the near term." 
Andrews added that many E&P companies in the region have already taken measures to protect against the differential and will not be affected greatly. The hustle and bustle of recent E&P and pipeline activity in the region are evidence of the vastness and potential of the Rocky Mountain play, he said.

Nevada Goes for the Gold

By Dave Todd 
dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> 

It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a case of Eastward Ho!

For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from Nevada. 

Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes "could be the genesis for industry departures from the state." The impact on large industrial users, he warned, could "provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn" in California, which accounts for about 12% of the United States GDP.

California's mass exodus
Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or "wannabes" whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply delivery.

Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, "Are there others like you? And they said, yes, we can introduce you to company after company after company." 

Overwhelmingly, it is high-tech California companies that are most interested in moving because of their ever-growing requirements for reliability in their electric service. Beyond that, "We have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to us-power producers," he said. These companies, including Calpine Corp., are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that, unlike California, Nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax, putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California. It also puts Nevada ahead of other low-tax Western states such as Arizona, Colorado and Utah. 

Reno/Silicon Valley share symbiotic relationship
Hollingsworth's northern counterpart at Reno's public/private sector-backed agency, the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada (EDAWN), tells a similar story. Chuck Alvey, who heads that body, says interest in his city from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense. 

A mere three-hours' drive and 40-minute plane ride from the San Francisco/San Jose area, Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of high-tech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have, up to now, escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energy-intensive industries. "Server farms," banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business operations, continue to grow in number. A single server farm can require as much as 10 MW of power to operate.

Strict new federal energy efficiency standards, to curb demand by other power hogs, such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps, clothes washers, water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment, won't be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis. The U.S. Department of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than $19 billion over the next 30 years. 

Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for 40,000 MW of new power generation, the new standards wouldn't be phased in until between 2003 and 2007. 

Stan Thomas, director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra Pacific Power Co., Nevada's dominant energy company, said his business has "experienced great success" at moving Silicon Valley-based firms' divisions into Nevada, albeit in a limited way. "But we're seeing a lot more companies saying: 'Wait a minute. We can't operate here anymore with power being shut off, and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product.' " 

He added that getting "a little more aggressive" about enticing electricity supply-constrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherry-picking operation at another state's expense. In fact, Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year, pausing to reconsider its options, as a direct result of California's policy confusion. "We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds (native in-state) demand," said Thomas. 

Sierra Pacific's power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new 345-kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah. In 1998, it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest. Both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator. 

"We're learning our lesson here," said Thomas. Setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West, the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plant-owners in general, he said. 

As for California, " I think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times, no doubt about it. And that's why what we're trying to do (in Nevada) is secure long-term contracts as well as short-term contracts to protect our customers while we're in the process of securing capacity, to ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates." 

Other areas targeting California companies
It's not just Nevada's physical proximity to California that helps it attract relocating companies. It's also the different opportunities offered by Nevada's two main population centers, Reno and Las Vegas. Both cities attract different kinds of energy-dependent businesses from California. In this regard, "We are two different markets," said Thomas.

In any case, Nevada isn't the only state that's getting calls, and returning interest in kind. Half a continent away, Tennessee's state department of economic and community development recently targeted about 1,000 California companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim "the lights are always on" in the electric power-rich Tennessee Valley Authority's service territory. Elsewhere across the nation, from Seattle to Manhattan, there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of servicing high-energy demand, Internet-related data centers. 

Nevada, however, has one giant advantage, aside from being closer to California. Las Vegas, for example, has one of the most extensive, readily accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United States. But of course it would. As the Nevada Development Authority's Hollingsworth joked: "Most everything we have here is state-of-the-art and brand new because we blow everything up every 20 years. We just implode it and build something new." The most recent casualty to fall to progress was the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, deemed past its prime, which bit the dust in October in a televised entertainment spectacle. Power to the people.

California to Get Yet Another Pipeline Expansion 
The frenzied pace of pipeline expansion in the West clearly is not over yet. PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) is planning another major expansion, potentially 500 MMcf/d, with a targeted in-service date of November 2003. 
The pipeline company said it is starting an open season today to accommodate the large number of shippers who requested service in its last market test for additional capacity. In December and January, the company held an open season for a 200 MMcf/d expansion and received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d.
"Based on the response to the open season we conducted earlier this year and the power plant construction that continues both along side and downstream of our system, we believe there is still an unmet need for new pipeline capacity in the states served by GTN," said Peter G. Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes the GTN system. 
In January, GTN offered 200 MDth/d of firm transportation capacity for service in 2002. Two power generators, Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine, were awarded the space.  Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. Calpine also announced its own major pipeline to California last week with partner Kinder Morgan.
The 2002 expansion will bring the total capacity of the 612-mile GTN system to 2,900 MDth/day at its Kingsgate, BC, receipt point. NEG is requesting expedited approval of that expansion so that partial service can begin as early as next winter, with full service available by summer 2002. Lund said the size of this major expansion will depend on the customer response in the open season, but GTN anticipates adding 300 MMcf/d to 500 MMcf/d. 
GTN's upstream gas transportation partner, TransCanada PipeLines, also is planning an expansion to accommodate the GTN additions. But besides GTN there are at least six other major pipeline expansions planned to serve California. Kern River has several expansions in the works. Colorado Interstate Gas is now planning to extend its proposed Ruby Pipeline across northern Nevada all the way to Sacramento. Questar has its Southern Trails pipeline to Long Beach under construction and has plans to expand its existing system and add a new storage field. 
El Paso is planning a variety of projects to increase deliveries to California and enhance gas transfers within the state using the All America Pipeline it purchased last year. Transwestern has an emergency expansion on file with FERC to add 150,000 Dth/d by June 2002, but could propose a much larger expansion in the near future because it received requests for 1.3 Bcf/d of additional capacity in an open season last fall. And Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans last week to build a 1,160-mile pipeline to deliver 1.75-2.25 Bcf/d of gas to San Francisco by summer 2003.

***********************************************************************

FUNDAMENTALS AND REGULATIONS CHANGE WESTERN ENERGY OUTLOOKS

Western energy markets are heading into summer with shifts in the fundamental
and regulatory environment. New forces will reduce pressures on prices and
reliability as the power peak builds.

*  The June 19 FERC Order represents a strong dampener of power prices.

*  Energy demand is off considerably on a year-over-year basis.

*  Lower energy demand has contributed to an easing in natural gas prices in
California, but higher summer loads will likely bring higher gas prices.

El Paso Capacity Split
Affiliates of El Paso Energy, Enron, Duke Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric appear to have picked up the largest shares of the 1.2 Bcf/d of available space on El Paso Natural Gas lines to Southern California points in the latest capacity auction. 
The assignments posted on the El Paso EBB from 30 companies mostly run for five or six years from the June 1, 2001 start date, with a few extending even longer. An El Paso spokesperson would not confirm the posted bids represented the final allocation, but industry sources said they did not expect the current holder of the 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity, El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contract runs out May 31, to exercise its right of first refusal. El Paso spokespersons have been promising an announcement for two days. 
It appears the winning bidders were taking no chances in going for the long term, since El Paso had said its economic evaluation of the bids would include returns up to five years. Rates paid were not disclosed, but sources were assuming, given current demand for capacity, they were at or near the maximum. The bids posted totaled 1,243,072 MMBtu/d and the leaders were (all volumes in MMBtu/d): El Paso Merchant Energy with 276,932, Enron Energy Services 254,056, Duke Energy affiliates 211,697, PG&E affiliates 151,300, Texaco Natural Gas 58,407, and Dynegy affiliates 56,418. 
For El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Duke and PG&E, the bulk of their capacity is for deliveries to PG&E at Topock. Other prospective capacity holders include MGI Supply Ltd., CEG Energy Options, Sempra Energy affiliates, Occidental Energy, Merrill Lynch Capital, Coral Energy, Mexicana del Cobre, AEP Energy Services, Allegheny Energy Supply, Williams Energy, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Burlington Resources, Paramount Petroleum, California Steel Industries, and others. 
Coming in the wake of the capacity squeeze going into California over the last year, the latest allocation was a far cry from the two previous auctions for about a third of El Paso's capacity relinquished by Pacific Gas & Electric in December 1997. Dynegy (then NGC) paid $70 million for the space for 1998 and 1999. The payment included about a 12-cent/Dth reservation charge, plus about 1.6-cent usage charge (see Daily GPI, Jan. 7, 1998 <d980107c.htm>). After that a contract with Enron for the space fell through and El Paso Merchant Energy picked up the capacity in January 2000 for 15 months for $38.5 million (see Daily GPI, Feb. 17, 2000 <d20000217e.html>). 
Management of the space has been under attack by California regulators and shippers since the first contract was awarded to NGC. El Paso and high-flying California border prices currently are among the targets of several investigations on-going in California and Washington. The company recently issued a press release labeling as "demonstrably untrue" allegations that capacity was manipulated to increase prices (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226g.html>).

New Generation Starts Up in CA; Others Drop Out 
Although California officials are gaining optimism from new electric generation plants finally coming on line today and in the next two weeks, there are signs that the electron rush of the past few years may peter out if the current uncertainties surrounding the state's electricity markets continue to fester. 
The state's chief cheerleader for new supply, conservation and federally ordered suppliers refunds, Gov. Gray Davis today takes his pom-poms to the oil fields southwest of Bakersfield to flip the switch on a new 320-MW, simple-cycle cogeneration plant developed by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification, whose supplies are totally dedicated to the state at about six cents/kwh, with a $4.40/MMBtu natural gas price over 10 years. 
But current generators and other developers of new plants are expressing caution toward continued unabated development of new plants, given pending state legislation that would impose windfall taxes and/or possible confiscation of private-sector generating plants, in addition to a law on the books that makes criminal acts of market manipulation by generators, if proven to be the case in court. (Most legislative proposals exempt new plants, however.) 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said earlier this month that it is holding up its plans for new plants, even though it recently won state approval to build a new 530 MW plant in the East San Francisco Bay suburbs, and it has proposed building a new plant in electron-starved San Francisco. Mirant placed the plans on hold until it feels the state political and economic climate has stabilized. 
And a Reliant Energy executive told stock market analysts Tuesday he would not be surprised to see delays and even cancellations of power projects throughout the West because of uncertain prices and the strange political environment (see related story, this issue). 
Another large generating company operating in California recently told NGI, any further projects it had been considering in California were "off the screen," and had been "pushed back to a study mode, at best." The generator, caught up in the current round of lawsuits, declined to be named. 
Although he admits some generators "want to wait a little bit," Steve Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission, which okays all major power plants, said, "generally speaking, the rush is still on. There are still people applying, so as far as we can tell. People are still coming to us with their energy projects and want them sited as quickly as possible." (About 7,800 MW are under construction, the energy commission said.) 
"We don't have a shortage of people wanting to build plants here in the state," said one of Davis's spokespeople, Roger Salazar. 
In the public sector, the nation's largest municipal utility, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has delayed plans on beginning construction of a 500 MW repowering project at an existing 325 MW power plant in the San Fernando Valley section of the city, because of problems with the local electrical workers' union that complained about the winning bidder being a nonunion contractor. LADWP said it could be delayed up to six months to allow the project to be re-bid. 
In the meantime, although not necessarily counted in the governor's highly promoted new power plants, LADWP is moving ahead with five new 50 MW peaking plants at existing plant sites, as part of a $1.5 billion integrated resource plan for the next five years. 
The governor stressed the accelerated time frame in which the Sunrise plant began construction on Dec. 7, 2000, making it operational in a record-setting 6.5 months. The construction force worked 18-hour days, six days a week, and the plant was brought on 32 days ahead of schedule. (Edison's MOU with the governor included financial incentives to get the plant on line early.) 
That makes it eligible for more than $1 million in construction incentive payments under the Governor's Executive Order (D-32). By the summer of 2003, it will have an output of 585 MW. As a single-cycle plant, the authority to operate runs for only 18 months, or this and next year's summers. It will be expanded and brought on as a combined-cycle, cogeneration and baseload unit for a longer time period. 
The plant is the first major one to start up since Davis took office. Two more are coming on line in the next two weeks. More than 4,000 MW of new power is expected to be online by the end of summer, in what the governor and his people are dubbing as "a California success story."

I've been provided a bootleg copy of the results of the El Paso open season.  Here's the most interesting thing... El Paso waived its right of first refusal under the one year deal done last year, and participated with everyone else in the open season.  Accordingly, they were allocated capacity along with everyone else.  Remember, all these deals were [supposedly] done at EPNG's max rates.  There were approx. 30 successful bidders, and their bids were for various term lengths.  Here are the more significant awards:

Burlington-  7,000
CEG Energy Options-  37,800
Coral-  15,000
Duke-  212,000
Dynegy- 56,500
El Paso Merchant- 277,000
ENA-  254,000
MGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000
Oxy-  19,000
PG&E (et al.)- 151,000
SMUD-  10,000
Sempra Trading-  6,500
SoCal- 19,000
Texaco-  58,500
Williams- 11,500

Here's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming at this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.

I'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124 MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/d expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 - 800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but would be an incrementally priced project.

FYI--Just in case you didn't get a copy of the announcement, below is the article from Inside FERC with the details of the filing at FERC of the previously announced expansion project to be completed and in-service by May, 2003.  Kern River will more than double their capacity into California by adding 885,626 Mcf/d of capacity.  There's also a related article in todays Gas Daily.  gh
  

KERN RIVER SUBMITS $1.26 BILLION PROJECT TO DOUBLE SYSTEM CAPACITY
With its 2002 Expansion certificate in hand, Kern River Gas Transmission Co. last Wednesday filed
with the commission its next capacity ramp-up, which would more than double the capacity of its 922-mile
gas pipeline system from Opal, Wyo., to California. The 2003 Expansion would bring supplies to a region
of the country that "has experienced well-documented, severe energy shortages," Kern River said.
The $1.26 billion project would add 885,626 Mcf/day of capacity to the 845,000 Mcf/day that will be
available once the 2002 Expansion (CP01-31) is complete (IF, 30 July, 6), said the Aug. 1 application. To
accomplish this, the 2003 Expansion would add 634.3 miles of 36-inch-diameter looping in Wyoming,
Utah, Nevada and California and 82.4 miles of 42-inch-diameter looping of a segment owned jointly with
Mojave Pipeline Co.
The application also calls for a net increase of 163,700 horsepower in compression. The upgrade
includes the construction of three new mainline compressor units - the proposed Coyote Creek station in
Uinta County, Wyo., the Salt Lake station in Salt Lake County, Utah, and the Dry Lake station in Clark
County, Nev. Five existing compressor stations also would be upgraded, and the Daggett compressor
station would be reconfigured to compress only Mojave volumes.
Kern River also plans to build a new meter station under its existing certificate to interconnect Kern
River/Mojave facilities with the 30-inch-diameter Adelanto lateral proposed by Southern California Gas
Co. In response to a request from SoCal Gas, the new Kramer Junction meter station is designed to deliver
up to 500,000 Mcf/day by the planned Dec. 31 in-service date. Although SoCal Gas is committed to
provide only 200,000 Mcf/day of firm access rights from this interconnect, additional takeaway capacity
will be available on an interruptible basis, the application said.
Kern River reported that 18 long-term transportation service agreements have been entered into
with shippers. Following an open season, about 85% of the capacity is contracted for 15-year periods and
the remainder for 10-year periods, the application said. Based upon representations made by the expansion
shippers, nearly all of the capacity is projected to be used to serve existing and new power generation
markets in California.
By far the biggest customer for the capacity would be Reliant Energy Services Inc., which signed a 15-
year agreement for 200,000 Dt/day. The next two largest subscribers are Edison Mission Energy (127,500
Dt/day) and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing L.P. (90,000 Dt/day).
The expansion's proposed initial daily incremental rate on a 100%-load-factor basis, excluding fuel, is
70?/Dt for 10-year firm service and 56.8?/Dt for 15-year firm service. In addition, the 2003 Expansion
shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in-kind reimbursement factor of 3.05% for volumes
transported from Wyoming to California; the rates would be lower for shorter trips.
As for supply, given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the
Rocky Mountain region, production could increase by more than 1.5 Bcf/day over the next year and by
4.5 Bcf/day over the next five years, according to a report prepared for Kern River by Barlow and Haun Inc.
In addition to the gas available from processing plants directly connected to Kern River in southwest-ern
Wyoming, shippers have access to supplies from other regions via Northwest Pipeline Corp., Colorado
Interstate Gas Co. and Questar Pipeline Co. at the Opal/Muddy Creek market center, the application said.
Two additional interstate pipelines - Wyoming Interstate Co. Ltd. and Overthrust Pipeline Co. - an-nounced
related open seasons in June that could result in interconnects providing access to supplies from
the Wind River and Wamsutter basins, the pipeline noted.
To meet the project's May 1, 2003, in-service date, Kern River asked the commission to issue a prelimi-nary
determination on nonenvironmental matters by Feb. 1, 2002, and a full certificate by May 1, 2002.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : May 24, 2001
PG&E NEG Breaks Ground on 1,048 MW Harquahala Plant 
After years of planning and regulatory hurdles, PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) began construction Monday on the Harquahala Generating Plant, a 1,048 MW natural gas-fired generating facility located approximately 70 miles west of Phoenix in the town of Tonopah, AZ (see Daily GPI, Aug. 17, 2000 <d20000817j.html>). 
The $500 million project is expected to help ease the burden of the surrounding electricity markets, which are currently very tight. The company said it envisions selling power in the fast-growing, three-state market of Arizona, southern Nevada and Southern California. The plant is scheduled to be in full commercial operation by June 2003. 
"Today's (Monday) groundbreaking is an important milestone for electricity consumers in Arizona and the Southwest, as well as for the National Energy Group," said Tom Boren, CEO of PG&E NEG. "Clean, efficient, affordable, electricity. That's what the Harquahala Generating Project is all about." 
The Shaw Group reported Wednesday that it has entered an agreement to provide the engineering, procurement and construction services for the project. Shaw said it will assume engineering duties immediately. 
The gas supply for the plant will come from the El Paso Natural Gas sSystem, which is located near its site. The plant is also located next to major transmission lines serving the three-state area and northern Mexico. With a fuel requirement averaging about 180 MMcf/d, PG&E NEG will have firm transportation agreements and then play the markets in the West and Southeast, according to Jim Tramuto, a Houston-based manager for NEG.

PG&E GT-NW Plans Lateral Across Washington State 
PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) said it received market requests for about three times the capacity on a proposed lateral that would cross Washington and compete with Northwest Pipeline for rapidly expanding power generation markets in the western half of the state along the I-5 highway corridor. GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region. 
"The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State," said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators. 
The lateral would begin at GTN south of Spokane and head west to the Mid-Columbia area in central Washington, across the Cascades to the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is served currently by only Northwest Pipeline. The ultimate route for the project has not been determined, and exact delivery points will be determined as the pipeline works out agreements with customers, the company said. "I want you to know that Mount Rainier is in the middle of the route area we are looking at but we will not be going over Mount Rainier because it's a national park; there's no way we are going to do that," said a GTN spokeswoman. "We're basically going to go from east to west over the mountains to I-5." 
The pipeline companies in the Pacific Northwest have worked themselves into an expansion frenzy with two large mainline expansions and this new state-crossing lateral planned by GTN and four large laterals, including a new line to Vancouver Island, planned by Williams' Northwest Pipeline.  The power crisis has been the primary driver. Up until the last few decades, the region has relied on hydroelectricity and wood for its power generation, but now it is turning to natural gas.

El Paso Holds Binding Open Season for Line 2000 Capacity 
Following up on an earlier testing of the waters, El Paso Natural Gas announced Tuesday a binding open season for 320 MMcf/d of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, AZ. The binding open season began July 5 and closes on Aug. 2. 
The project is part of the company's response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. It follows on an open season announced in late June for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on a bi-directional lateral it plans to add to its system within California. The lateral, which El Paso obtained as part of its purchase of the All American oil pipeline in February 2000, runs from the area of Daggett, CA, southeast to the area of Blythe, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, on the Colorado River. The company intends to convert the line to transport gas between the two points, which are major spot market points for gas trading (see Daily GPI, June 20 <d20010620g.html%20>). That open season ended Tuesday, but a spokesperson said it was too soon to publish results. 
The expansion capacity from West Texas will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, TX to the California border near Ehrenberg. It will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, with an estimated fuel charge of 5%. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental and right-of-way authorizations. 
The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Co.'s and Pacific Gas & Electric's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg into California, and any upstream points on El Paso's South Mainline system where capacity exists. 
"This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands, including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States," said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas. 
Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Tests Market for Mainline Expansion
El Paso Natural Gas apparently got the message when its last open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity attracted bids for 14.4 Bcf/d. The pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border. 
El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand because of enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a Jan. 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to "assist the difficult situation" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission recommended El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. 
El Paso Vice President Al Clark told the commission that market demand for an expansion would have to be evaluated first. He said the open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity being held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy would give the first indication whether such an expansion was needed. 
Following such a resounding wake-up call, El Paso is holding a new open season to determine interest in additional capacity on the mainline or in relinquishing mainline space. The open season will end March 23. 
El Paso officials said they will consider requests for firm transportation service originating in any receipt basin and delivered to any location on its system. If a new load can be matched to an existing shipper's offer of release or relinquishment, El Paso will attempt to facilitate the transfer of the capacity between the parties prior to proposing an expansion. Upon receipt of non-binding expressions of interest, they will begin to identify appropriate facilities to possibly expand the system. 
Clark previously told FERC the pipeline could add compression to the proposed Line 2000 project or replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon. Another option, he said, would be to add new compression to the existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. The economics of the project will determine the eventual form. 
For more information on the open season visit El Paso's web site <http://tebb.epenergy.com/ebbEPG/ebbmain.asp?sPipelineCode=EPNG> or call Jerry W. Strange, director of transportation marketing, at (915) 496-3139.

Pipe Expansions Planned for Rockies Region 
With several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the Rocky Mountain region, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC (KMIGT) announced two major projects Wednesday, and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the 13th Annual Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Strategy Conference. 
Headlining the news was KMIGT's plans to use existing rights-of-way to build the Advantage Pipeline, which would fill the same needs as the Colorado Interstate Gas pipe, moving from the Cheyenne Hub to the Mid-Continent. An open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall. 
Dave Scharf, business development director for KMIGT, said the 24-inch pipe, which would move gas primarily from the Powder River Basin, would have a capacity of 330 MMcf/d, delivering to interconnects on its way to the Kansas City markets. 
"It would have a smaller size, with about 40% less content," Scharf said, but it would be expandable to 450 MMcf/d, with access to liquid Mid-Continent pipes, local distribution centers and end-use markets. 
A smaller pipeline, NECO -- a 12-inch pipe, about 95 miles long -- would serve the northeastern Colorado market. Although small, Scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state, and would also allow backhauls to Cheyenne. An open season on this line is also scheduled this fall, Scharf said. 
KMIGT also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the Rockies, adding more horsepower at the Cheyenne Hub and Huntsman facility. The Huntsman would be expanded to deliver 75 MMcf/d, with delivery at Cheyenne of 45 MMcf/d. 
"We want to customize shippers' needs," Scharf said of the expansion. Noting there were synergies between the three projects, he said KMIGT was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion. "Rocky Mountain growth opportunities we see are in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska," he said. 
El Paso's Craig Coombs, who directs project development for the company's Western Pipeline Group, said El Paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the Rockies, with a Cheyenne to Mid-Continent connection, spending $380 million to add 540 MDth/d. The open season for this expansion ended July 20, said Coombs, and he said El Paso is now negotiating with shippers. A FERC filing is scheduled for December 2001, with an in-service date in late 2003 or early 2004. 
Coombs also updated attendees on the CIG expansion along the Front Range of the Rockies, which he said is on track to be in service by mid-2004. Over the next four years, Coombs said supply from the Rockies would grow from 5 Bcf/d to 7.5 Bcf/d, and warned there would be "blood on the streets" if pipeline systems are not expanded. 
Coombs said El Paso planned to file its request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January 2002 for its Ruby pipeline, which is scheduled to carry 250 MDth/d from the Rockies into Nevada and 500 MDth/d into California. The Ruby project, said Coombs, "is designed with power plants in mind." The pipeline will be 30-36-inches with 40,000 horsepower. 
El Paso's Western Frontier pipeline project, which also closed its open season in July, is also is on schedule, with a FERC filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an in-service target date by November 2003. 
"What's driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects," Coombs said. With more than 9,200 MW proposed in the region in the coming years, he said capacity would rise more than 2 Bcf/d by 2010. Noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals, Coombs said that there is "still tremendous growth" in the Rockies. 
Shelley Wright, supervisor of capacity marketing for Questar Pipeline Co., detailed the many projects her company has under way in the Rockies, including its Main Line 104, the Clay Basin Projects, the Southern Trails pipe to California and its work on the Eakin compressors. 
The Main Line 104, a joint venture with El Paso's CIG, will move new and existing gas supplies to the Wasatch Front and other connecting pipes. It is expected to be in service in November 2001, and is on schedule and moving forward, Wright said. She also noted that the Clay Basin, which is the largest storage facility in the western United States, was already ahead of schedule for 2001-2002 storage. 
"We're seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year" than last, Wright said, noting that storage was depleted last winter. The Clay Basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in April 2002, which "may result in additional firm capacity." Wright said there had been "a lot of interest in additional storage capacity," and Questar will know more next year as to whether it will expand the facility.

El Paso Moves Forward on California Expansion Projects 
Encouraged by the results of recent market tests, El Paso Natural Gas announced two binding open seasons yesterday for 400-500 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on a bi-directional lateral it plans to add to its system within California. It also plans to announce soon additional binding open seasons to expand its mainline. 
The lateral, which El Paso obtained as part of its purchase of the All American oil pipeline in February 2000, runs from the area of Daggett, CA, southeast to the area of Blythe, CA, and Ehrenberg, AZ, on the Colorado River. The company intends to convert the line to transport gas between the two points, which are major spot market points for gas trading. The project will facilitate the movement of gas within California and provide service to power plants in California and Arizona. The open seasons close on July 10. 
In its previous non-binding open season May 1-25, El Paso said it received requests for more than 2.1 Bcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and more than 0.9 Bcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. El Paso is offering to build capacity capable of transporting 500 MMcf/d on the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and 400 MMcf/d on the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett path. The receipt and delivery points are interchangeable for the two paths. In the Daggett area, receipt/delivery points include interconnects with Mojave Pipeline, Kern River, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Gas. In the Blythe and Ehrenberg area, the points include interconnects with the proposed North Baja Pipeline Project, Southern California Gas for incremental capacity within California, and El Paso's existing system near Ehrenberg for transportation upstream of California. 
For both the Daggett-to-Ehrenberg path and the Ehrenberg-to-Daggett paths, El Paso is offering a reservation rate of no greater than 10 cents/Mcf on a 100% load factor basis. El Paso is estimating a fuel charge for both paths of 1.5%. 
If the open seasons result in sufficient binding transportation agreements to make the lateral project economically viable, El Paso will file with FERC with a goal of placing the project in service during the first quarter of 2003.

As was foretold by some of the Kern expansion shippers, these shippers are justifiably angry about the way Kern has sold capacity in their open season, particularly as concerns shippers' access to markets on SoCal Gas through Wheeler Ridge.  However, what's even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message TW embodied in its GIR proposal -- new market entrants should only have secondary rights to SoCal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage.

Shippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales
Chevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum have called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling delivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. distribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, in a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation case, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). 
On Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into SoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas indicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers told FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. 
Not true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. "We have to date subscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 dth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway." The combined Kern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having 450,00 and Mojave 150,000. "We can move more than that capacity, and we have," she added. 
SoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular basis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be "creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the Commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El Paso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point," they added. While they support the expansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern California degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler Ridge. 
Dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler Ridge point, but "adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on SoCal more supply options. Shippers have to compete." 
The shippers are concerned, however that "substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers...." The Commission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at Wheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [emphasis added] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

It seems the FERC has a pretty decent grasp not only on the physical issues, but they took the liberty of firing a shot across the bow of the CPUC on the regulatory landscape as well.  I wonder how Breathitt's message will play into next week's CPUC workshop on gas infrastructure?

Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the "precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword," warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC "should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action." 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the "extraordinary regulatory treatment" that the Commission gave it. Critics claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything, she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is. 
There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm." 
The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers. 
"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines," the order said [CP01-106. For starters, "the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge." Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted. 
"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers," the order said. 
"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction." 
The project would increase the "limited-term, incremental transportation capacity" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. 
Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project recently went through an open season

Tuscarora Proposes to Expand Nevada Pipe 
Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. wants to expand its 229-mile pipeline system extending from Malin, OR, to capture a growing Nevada market. Under an application filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it would add three compressor stations and a 14-mile pipeline extension to nearly double capacity to 220 MMcf/d, up from its current 124 MMcf/d. The in-service date, if approved, would be late 2002. 
"The expansion of the Tuscarora Pipeline is a key ingredient in the continued economic prosperity of northern Nevada and will meet the growing natural gas needs of new and existing customers well into the future," said Greg Galbraith, director of marketing and transportation for Tuscarora Gas. 
The expanded capacity would serve two new power generation facilities in Nevada near Tracy and Wadsworth. Duke Energy plans to construct a 540 MW plant near Wadsworth, and Morgan Stanley is now constructing the 360 MW Naniwa Energy facility near Tracy. 
The added capacity also would supplement the growing gas distribution needs of Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., which collectively distribute natural gas to all of northern Nevada and portions of northern California. 
If FERC approves the application, Tuscarora said it would begin construction in April 2002 and begin service by the end of that year. The $60 million project expansion would be supported by long-term, firm transportation contracts ranging from 10-to-15 years that are contingent upon completion, said Tuscarora. The contracts would meet new power generation loads as well as growth in existing local distribution company markets. 
"The contracts that underpin this project demonstrate that there is a growing demand for natural gas in the markets served by Tuscarora and that Tuscarora is well positioned to capture that growth," said Ron Turner, CEO of TC PipeLines GP Inc., a subsidiary of TC PipeLines LP, which owns 49% of Tuscarora. It also is a subsidiary of TransCanada. 
The pipeline was constructed in 1995 in a partnership with Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. It stretches from Malin, OR through Northern California to Sierra Pacific Power Co.'s Tracy Power Station near Reno.

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at "essential public services" the increase in DG is expected from "clean" sources, not diesel emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for "clean" sources of generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Williams Completes 2001 Kern River Expansion Ahead of Schedule 
SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) completed construction of expansion facilities on its Kern River natural gas transmission system on July 1. Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.
 "We received FERC approval within three weeks of filing - an unprecedented turnaround. This allowed us to expedite the construction process and bring additional supplies of natural gas to the California market," said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. "We anticipate most of the new natural gas will go directly to power generation facilities." 
The emergency expansion project added two new compressor stations in Utah and one in California, as well as upgraded compressor units at three existing compressor stations in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The installation of these facilities increased the transportation capacity on Kern River by approximately 19 percent. Williams completed the multimillion project more than three weeks ahead of schedule. 
"The extraordinary effort put forth by our contractors, employees and permitting agencies resulted in a successful completion of the project ahead of schedule," stated Micheal Dunn, manager of project management for Kern River. 
With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. The gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. The expanded system has a design capacity of 835 million cubic feet per day.

Title: Demand, Prices to Follow Trajectory of the Economy 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2702;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--POWER AND GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY EXPECTED TO FALL

CERA expects a weaker US economy to be one of the outcomes of the tragic events 
on September 11, 2001, which will further reduce the demand for gas and power. 
Spot prices for natural gas and power already reflect this expectation, and 
CERA's outlook anticipates continued price weakness. 

*  As new supplies continue to arrive over the next year, even as demand 
weakens, the West will have more than adequate supplies of gas and power.
 
*  This surplus supply situation will put additional downward pressure on 
prices.

*  The shift from supply tightness to the recent plunge in prices can be traced 
principally to the rapid decline in demand for both gas and power this year, 
while supplies grew.

CIG Dusts Off Ruby Pipeline, Plans Extension to Sacramento, CA 
El Paso subsidiary Colorado Interstate Gas is dusting off its Ruby Pipeline project in light of the scramble to increase deliveries to the California market. The project, which originally was announced in 1998 to serve northern Nevada, will be extended to Reno, NV, and into California, the pipeline said in an open season announcement. 
"In response to increased demand for gas supply in northern Nevada and northern California markets, Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (CIG) is announcing an open season to evaluate constructing interstate gas transmission capacity from the Rockies to these markets," the announcement states. "Natural gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins is projected to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline Project (Ruby) will provide access to these supplies." 
CIG said it has been working with shippers interested in developing an 850-mile 30- and 36-inch diameter pipeline running from western Wyoming through Elko, NV, Reno, Yuba City, CA, and ending in Sacramento, CA. CIG also anticipates interconnecting in Northern California with Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own open season to evaluate expanding its facility. Ruby will be capable of providing up to 750 MDth per day of incremental transportation capacity to these areas. It is anticipated to be in service in late 2003. 
Parties interested in obtaining transportation service to delivery points in northern Nevada and Northern California are invited to submit bids in this open season, which started on April 23 and will close on May 31. Questions concerning the open season should be directed to Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387; Ed Miller (719) 520-4305; or Tom Dobson (719) 520-4606.

Third Western Canada Pipeline Expansion Proposed 
Where's that scorecard? It's never around when you need it. By our count there are now three new proposals on the Canadian side to upgrade service through southern British Columbia and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Westcoast Energy entered the Northwest expansion lists last week with an announcement of an open season to run through the end of May for more capacity on its Southern Mainline and Westcoast Alberta line to accommodate additional volumes from supply areas in British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. 
The supplies would be directed by Nov. 1, 2003 to "growing market demand in the BC Lower Mainland and the U.S. Pacific Northwest." Westcoast is looking to expand its Southern BC Mainline from Compressor Station 2 to the Huntingdon delivery area (Zone 4) by about 200 MMcf/d and its Westcoast Alberta line from Nova/Gordondale to ABC/Gordondale, westbound by about 100 MMcf/d. The Canadian pipeline said its latest proposal matches the timing of an expansion by Northwest Pipeline, which connects with Westcoast at the border at Sumas/Huntingdon. 
The mainline expansion "provides a very cheap expansion going straight south to Sumas. It can be done very quickly and very cheaply because it will loop existing line," said spokesman Robert Foulkes.It will start at the northern end from the T-South junction of various gathering lines, including the line south from the hot Northwest Territories development area. It's also possible the pipeline will look at a later expansion north of Fort St. John to increase the flow from that area. The Gordondale expansion also will bring in additional volumes from Alberta. 
"This is in response to very good exploration and production results. Our line has been operating almost full, consistently through the winter," Foulkes said. 
Westcoast's proposal came a week after BC Gas Utility Ltd., said it was pursuing a plan to expand its brand-new Southern Crossing Pipeline also to increase pipeline capacity in southern BC and into the U.S. Pacific Northwest at Huntingdon, BC, across the border from Sumas,WA (see Daily GPI, April 4 <d20010404g.html>). BC Gas' plan calls for a 161-mile long expansion pipeline, costing about C$460 million. Questioned, Foulkes said he did not consider the BC line a competitor for Westcoast's proposal, since Westcoast would be providing direct service from the north through a less expensive looped line. 
TransCanada PipeLine also has announced an expansion of its Nova Gas Transmission system and its BC System to its border connection at Kingsgate, B.C./Eastport, ID to match an expansion of PG&E GT Northwest (see Daily GPI, Feb. 26 <d20010226k.html>, March 26 <d20010326j.html>). Following an open season, TransCanada said it would expand its Alberta system by 227 MMcf/d and its BC system by 216 MMcf/d. 
For its venture Westcoast is looking for binding commitments for 15-year contracts. For shippers with existing service on the two legs, "relinquishment is being requested and will be considered." Also, "Westcoast is concerned about expiration of existing firm service agreements. Where appropriate, Westcoast may ask shippers to renew service for a mutually agreeable period." 
The expansion could increase the toll on the mainline by 1-2 cents (Canadian), and on the Alberta segment by a half a cent (Canadian). For further information go to www.wei-pipeline.com. <http://www.wei-pipeline.com>
