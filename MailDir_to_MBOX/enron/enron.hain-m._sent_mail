Mary,
 Here is the draft TSA you requested.  Mike has provided the
supporting information.  Although the Interconnection Study and System
Impact Study are included, the IOA is not.  That will be subject to
finalization in parallel with this document.

Alan,
 I agree that we need to raise this issue in scheduling, ancillary services 
and congestion management content groups.  In those groups we would be 
selling the concept.  Actual implementation of the provisions would be in the 
tariff content group, where the actual requirements would be codified.  This 
way it will be blessed by FERC and built into all operating protocols.

Steve, Mary,

Where in the RTO West process should Enron make its pitch for information 
transparency?  To me, it would be part of the scheduling / ancillary services 
work group and part of congestion managment.  I am assuming we do not want to 
leave it to Makret Monitoring because to get information release in real-time 
or near-real-time requires that information release systems get built into 
the actual RTO operational systems.

At some point, we need to weigh in and try to get information release built 
into the Stage 2 filings.

Thanks,

Alan

ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD
Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members

January 23, 2001
01-006
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the
26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator
Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly
reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.

The "quo warranto" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court.
The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from
their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an
opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.

The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which
reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the
governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.

Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing
board pursuant to the new law.

The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the
power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and
between neighboring states.

I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy 
counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a "Suggestion of Bankruptcy" 
rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  

In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the 
debtor or the debtor's property.  Joe questioned whether the stay applies to 
our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which 
excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the 
exercise of police and regulatory power.

According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of 
the stay.  He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our 
complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.  I said it could be argued 
whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal 
Power Act.  While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, 
he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the 
court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it 
violated the automatic stay.  

He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except 
the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.  EPMI could 
itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of 
establish a trustee in the case. *  Apparently, there was a conference call 
with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file 
this "Suggestion of Bankruptcy."

* Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7 
of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a "debtor in possession" and a 
trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is 
warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.

Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's 
grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888 
on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a 
grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate 
Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory 
in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are 
asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be 
noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. 
petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  
Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next 
week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market 
transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their 
reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons:

Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was 
not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information 
necessary for refunds.
We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more 
liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals 
will not be achieved.
Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be 
achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell 
out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.

PUC Member Brownell Named to FERC

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
 
Filed at 5:52 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush nominated Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on
Tuesday.
Brownell, a member of the state panel since 1997, would serve on the federal
commission through 2006 if confirmed by the Senate.
The five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale power
markets and interstate natural gas pipelines.
During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee
Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which has been praised as a national
model.
She has supported research into renewable sources of energy and was
instrumental in having the commission create a $21 million fund to be used for
investment in clean energy projects including wind, solar and biogas ventures.
The 53-year-old native of Erie, Pa., previously served as executive director
of the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia and was a senior vice
president of Meridian Bancorp Inc. She attended Syracuse University.

Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez=

bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current=

It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government=

also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also=

solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for=20
forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy=20
which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin=

assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the=20
benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate=

freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.
re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average=20

California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significa=

Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and 
outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm 
pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one 
project.  Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates 
under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  The Commission has 60 days to 
accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or 
the filing is deemed accepted.  EWG applications are made under Section 32 of 
the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.  Thereunder, the Commission must make 
an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.

Mary-- I have several "new guy" questions for you.  How do we prefer to take 
care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for 
EWG status in connection with power plant developments?  I ask this in the 
context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development 
vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation.  
Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. affairs people, through Enron 
DC office people, through outsside counsel for the project, through outside 
counsel not otherwise affiliated with the project, or otherwise? And, when do 
we  usually do the filings? Thanks.

Subject: Comments on RTO West December 1st Filing

I have not gone over the filing in great detail, I have found one thing we 
may want to file to address.  All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed 
to eliminate the export fees.  PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking 
the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in 
the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing.  I think we should consider 
filing comments  to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the 
following reasons:

Elimination of the export fees is a positive step to resolve one of the three 
major "seams" issues.  With RTO West taking the lead, the other RTOs (CAISO & 
DSTAR) can follow suit.
The nature and type of export fee to be used would have to be developed.  
This eat up an enormous amount of time on a speculative fee which the 
majority of the parties are opposed to including.  The delay engendered and 
use of limited resources is unconsiounable.

We can reiterate our concerns regarding allocation of rights instead of an 
auction and about the potential exclusion of facilities from the RTO West 
control.  The December 1st filing really doesn't change those things.  Since 
the comments are due on the 16th and I will be gone all next week, I thought 
I had better let you know my views before leaving.

I am including the IPP/Marketers comments for reference.

Steve

This is getting rediculous.  Twenty four hours notice is simply not 
sufficient time to give us the notice required by the tariff.  Given the 
current barrage of data requests and confidentiality requests I hadn't even 
had time to read your E-mail when it was past time to respond.  Accordingly, 
Mike Day will be sending to FERC a request for confidential treatment.

Linda:  Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC 
Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure.    From 
yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language 
in the energy bill to address transparancy issues.  As you know, Senator 
Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing 
due to the questions we had drafted.  I can work on the bipartisanship issue 
and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a 
state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets 
both the federal and state needs.  please advise.  many thanks.

Cynthia,

Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
in
following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
legislation.

Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
this.

- Joshua

I am under the impression that we still need to file the attached protest to 
a 12/13/00 Cal PX FERC filing that would (in the PX's interpretation) allow 
them to confiscate our collateral in the Block Forward Market to satisfy the 
defaults of other participants in the PX markets.  Please let me know if we

Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in 
the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a 
"friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of 
wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered?

In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, 
March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is 
designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in 
real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the 
December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the 
ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund 
potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification 
unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its 
transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely 
insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order 
is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the 
Commission rules.

Subject: FERC Order and DWR

Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary:

I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH 
soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any 
other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.  Is that correct? 
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

I'd like to clean this up a little more but here is my first crack on what we 
should send.  I left in two paragraphs that are repetitive that relate Stan's 
conversation with Nevada Power in September.  Stan would you draft these two 
paragraphs together and make them factully correct?  Thanks.

Subject: More PX Exposure: EEI Event of Default

As if we needed another reason to avoid at all costs a default at the PX:  

I notice that one "Event of Default" under Enron's EEI master agreement is an 
Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the 
acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million.  This sounds like our 
doomsday scenario at the PX, under which we default on a payment or 
chargeback, and the PX liquidates our block forward/CTS positions, which the 
PX values in excess of negative $100 million, and then exercises our LCs.  

This makes it even more imperative that we (1) avoid a default at the PX and 
(2) reduce our CTS collateral with the PX.

Attached find Enron Power Marketing, Inc., and Enron Energy Services' 
responses to the Staff's data requests in the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's Bulk Power Investigation.  These responses assumes that you sent 
separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that 
information.  The answers also assume you are requesting this information for 
California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.  Please let me know 
if these assumptions are incorrect.  

If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact 
Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.  Enron requests confidential 
treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 
388.112.  Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable 
to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in 
question 4.  We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday.  
Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-8862.  I will be traveling on 
Monday, so if you call then, call my cell phone at 503 807-0929.

Subject: Conference Call/PX Response


Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion 
for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.  As an initial caveat, we have 
prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.  Like the rest of the Group, we 
have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we 
reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we 
expect the rest of the Group will.  In addition, we have the following 
comments:

1.  In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of 
preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the 
preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant 
general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.  It seems 
to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should 
proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking 
further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve 
the charge-back issues.  Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to 
address this issue in the response.  The Group may want to consider 
approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.

2.  Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding 
as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.  We have tried 
to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is 
simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete 
relief as part of the Debtor's motion.  If the Debtor objects to the expanded 
relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically 
the subject of the motion.  We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to 
help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional 
motion for relief.

3.  Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the 
appropriate counsel is listed.  I am trying to simply list the "bankruptcy" 
counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is 
any question relative to a party.  We have not intentionally left anybody 
off.  If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them 
to the list.

If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it 
to the other members of group.

We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.  The 
dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883.  The confirmation number is 5096040.  If 
you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New 
York at 212/424-8482 or Jim Huemoeller at 303/291-2632.

Here are some FERC cases I'll probably be working on in the next month: (1) 
In Docket No. EL00-95-?, et al. the Cal ISO and EOB's Motion for Issuance of 
Refund Notice and (2) Cal PX Compliance filing and request for expedited 
Commission guidance in EL00-95-015.  Also I'll be assisting Gary Fergus and 
Richard Sanders with our discussion with the ISO about reporting cost of 
service information.  That's about as far ahead as I can see at the moment.

Hello, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration  Group.
?
Like so many of you, I seem to be in a perpetual state of  triage these 
days.? I apologize it has taken me so long to follow up on our  meeting of 
February 7, but at last I have prepared a summary of the various  assignments 
and tasks we identified at that meeting.
?
Attached for your reference is a "work tracking document"  with the 
information from the February 7 meeting.

The work tracking document (along with various other  materials posted since 
the February 7 meeting) is on the RTO West Website  at:

Here's my solution.  FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder 
developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to 
in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do 
something else because they are not properly constituted.  We could also 
argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm 
that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to 
what has been proposed for RTO West.  This will help us in ultimately putting 
the West RTOs together.

Subject: Cal ISO Not Filing CM Proposal at FERC - EPMI Response?

Mary informs me that the Cal ISO has filed (1-30-01) with FERC that it will 
not be filing a new Congestion Management proposal at FERC as required in 
previous Orders.

She thinks now is an opportune time to challenge the legitimacy of the new 
Cal ISO Board (Gov Davis' actions).   I also think that we need to put 
forward our own solution (if we have one).

I would appreciate everyone's opinion as to the (a) likelihood that FERC 
would finally address the matter, (b) end result if FERC does deal with the 
issue, (c) and the politics in Sacramento / CPUC of taking this position.  
Also, who else is going to weigh in on our proposal?

Jim

Subject: Re: Electronic Scheduling  

The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the 
scheduling practices will be.  This is driven by the fact that the RTO 
efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders.   The 
problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to 
define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have 
taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices.   In 
the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3 
RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).   

FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams 
issues.   At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function 
8 is lowest on their list of priorities.  Several, includig a rep from the 
West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched, 
will likely need FERC involvement to "force" a compromise or settlement.   
The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams 
problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to 
address the seams issues.   Our argument, of course, is that these are the 
entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams.
 
So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26 
scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice, 
or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses, 
ramp rates).  My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality ( 
for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices 
that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of 
congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merely 
point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at 
the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO.   The threat to us 
is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some "lowest common 
denominator" approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of 
another.

If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that will 
impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express those 
to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West.  Enron is party 
to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to 
highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams.  I do intend 
to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional 
FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as 
possible.

Hi Charles, 

I was going over the NERC meeting minutes and noticed that you were in 
attendance at the meeting.  I would appreciate it if you would tell me your 
opinion about the process, your views on the Escheduling practice as it is 
shaping up, and if you plan to stay involved in the ESC meetings. You are 
welcome to call or e-mail me at your convenience.

Thank you,

Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an 
interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been 
reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us 
anyway.  

Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to 
perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the 
queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me 
to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission 
requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think 
Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person.  
Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether 
other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue.

Subject: Buying power from Industrials

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES 
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials "agent" when buying an 
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial 
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the 
"Impower" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for 
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). 

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings 
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they 
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron 
generally has to also file for "EWG" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to 
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business 
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not 
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

 
Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). 

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

See attached E-mail from Paul.  As Paul discusses a bunch of us in the West 
have not done internal resource reports since about September.  Anyway, in 
response to Paul's E-mail, I have done a report.  Does our group do these

Subject: RTO West/PRRQ -- RRG Meeting


To Members of the RTO West Provisions and Requirements Content Group:

Hello!

As you may already know, at last Friday's meeting, the RRG agreed that
the RTO West process should refocus its efforts over the next few weeks
on, at a minimum, congestion management and pricing.  Just what that
means for the other content groups is unclear, although it is possible
that some will continue and others will be put on hold until critical
congestion management and pricing decisions are made.  The Coordinating
Team is preparing a recommendation and participants will be informed
about the changes to the work plan and schedule in the near future.

I think it is likely that the work of the Provisions and Requirements
Content Group will be put on hold for some time, and that the April
17-18 retreat will be rescheduled.  That said, you should wait until you
receive the final word on the schedule before you change your plans.

I will keep you posted.

Take care!  Kristi

Subject: ISO "Market Stabilization Plan": Curtailment of firm exports

Summary:  The ISO announced today that it plans to submit a proposal to FERC 
under which it will curtail firm exports (not let suppliers send electricity 
out of California) during system shortages.  If approved, this proposal could 
have catastrophic effects on surrounding control areas because it would 
transfer California's supply problems elsewhere, primarily to the Pacific 
Northwest.  The ISO's plan to hoard electricity violates the open access 
principles of Order 888 and could possibly cause a cascade of contract 
defaults if buyers in the Pacific Northwest do not receive power and are 
forced to cover in this volatile market. 

We can wait until the ISO files this plan with FERC at the end of the month, 
or we can get ahead of this important issue and ask FERC to rule on this 
before the ISO submits its report.  A preemptive strike presumes that  we can 
overcome any procedural hurdles inherent in challenging an unfiled proposal.  
The ISO has cut some EPMI's real-time schedules over the past month or two, 
so perhaps we could get FERC to look at the curtailment issue in that context.

Tim has asked that the legal/regulatory team make this a top priority.  
Because of its importance he also wants to make sure that he and other 
traders are actively involved in preparing the FERC complaint.

Background:  Today the ISO announced the details of its "Market Stabilization 
Plan."  Although the plan may be DOA at FERC for several reasons, the ISO 
declared that under this plan it intends to require in-state generators to 
bid their full capacity into the proposed day-ahead market.  When questioned 
on the details of this, the ISO stated that, yes, it planned to curtail firm 
exports of energy from California during system shortages.  In other words, 
during shortages the ISO would cut the transmission schedules of in-state 
generators sending electricity out of California---even if those sales were 
"firm," and even if those sales were under existing long-term contracts.

The ISO argued that under its tariff it has the authority to cut schedules in 
emergency situations.  True.  But the reality is that the "emergency" is 
self-inflicted; by imposing price caps (another part of this Market 
Stabilization plan), the ISO is driving supply out of California.  As others 
have argued, the only "emergency" is price:  California has made a decision 
to keep consumer rates artificially low, and its use of price-controls has 
reduced the supply---causing a supply "emergency"---, and the ISO now seeks 
to increase its supply by building a one-way wall around the state of 
California.  Like the roach motel, megawatts check into California, but they 
don't check out.

Subject: Re: Draft interconnection procedure  

Comments:

2.3     Delete last sentence.  If Enron is already in the queue (or 
considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at 
FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to 
remain in the queue.  I don't think this is necessary and all are protected 
because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.

4.3   Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost 
unfortunately).  It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days.  PGE is 
protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a 
notification.

6    ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these 
changes for PGE.)

 6.1  Add after "as modified by the Commission" "if Customer chooses to 
commence construction."
6.2   Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward 
placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make 
reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after 
notification and opportunity to remedy.)

Thanks.

Subject: Draft interconnection procedure

Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley 
agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I 
mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a 
quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today.

Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be.
As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power.

Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT.

Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.

Thanks.

Jay.

Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get 
companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements.  
Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of 
companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to 
address the problem with each company/entity.

Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call 
them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the 
FERC hotline on a confidential basis.

Subject: Notice/Agenda for RTO West RRG Meeting on March 23, 2001



Hello, Everyone -

This Notice confirms our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 2001,
from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel.
Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should be
shorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 11:00 a.m.

The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phased
approach to implementing congestion management.  The filing utilities are
very aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about process
overload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filing
utilities are considering a more focused process that will call for
prioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks.  Part of this more
focused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestion
management implementation. A background paper for your review before the
meeting is attached.

The working agenda is:

1. Market Monitoring:  Recommendation Regarding Stage 1 Decision

2. Clarification of RTO West Treatment of Losses

3. Clarification of Stage 1 Decision on Interconnection Standards

4.. Potential Phasing of Congestion Management Implementation

5. Report on TransConnect

6. Benefit-Cost Study

A word about the new benefit-cost study.  It is my view that before we can
profitably engage in a new study that will be useful to regional parties a
number of issues need to be resolved first.  For example, it will be
important to know and not just assume what the scope and regional
configuration of RTO West is likely to be.  We are all waiting for FERC's
response to the October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding the
RTO West scope and regional configuration as proposed in the October 23
application.  The reason for my uncertainty and the need for clarification
on scope and regional configuration is FERC's press release of March 14 in
which it "encouraged the formation of a regional transmission organization
(RTO) for the western markets."  What does this mean for RTO West? In
addition to understanding the scope of RTO West, it will also be important
to know and not just assume what the congestion and pricing models will be
for RTO West.  Determining these models will probably take a few more weeks.
As we discussed in earlier RRG meetings, a benefit-cost analysis may become
important parts of filings with the various state commissions.
Understanding what the state commissions are looking for is also important.
Because of  the need for this information, and the more focused process we
are considering, I have recommended to the filing utilities that the
benefit-cost work be deferred until these issues are resolved.  I would
appreciate your views on this subject at the RRG meeting as well.

I look forward to seeing you this Friday, March 23.

- Bud

Subject: Greenspan on electricity



 As I mentioned, here's just the electricity portion of this
morning's transcript.  Murray apparently did not make the hearing and asked
Wyden to touch on the issue, which he briefly did.  I'll find out if Murray
submitted her questions for the record.

Sue, etal --

Not sure if you had seen this.  How should we follow these issues (people, 
time, etc.)?  Is this important?  I'd appreciate any comments.

Attached is a summary of the California FTR product, how to schedule, and
the timeline.  To access the issues around the Seams between California,
Northwest, and the Southwest, we need to understand the FTR characteristics
for all the three RTOs.  This is a starting point for discussion during next
weeks conference call and the Dec meeting.

		 Subject: Re: FERC Order and DWR

In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, 
March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is 
designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in 
real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the 
December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the 
ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund 
potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification 
unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its 
transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely 
insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order 
is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the 
Commission rules.

Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary:

I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH 
soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any 
other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.  Is that correct? 
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Participants: 

Last Friday, January 26th, the Special and Correcting  Invoices for the 
Southern 
California Edison  (SCE) default were due and there were some Participants 
who 
failed to comply with Schedule 2. Section 4.3.2. of the PX  Tariff which 
states, 
"All payments by  the PX Participants shall be made to the PX Clearing 
Account 
via the Fedwire System for funds to be received at the PX  Clearing Account 
no 
later than noon PPT on  the Payment Due Date." 

Additionally, Schedule 2, Section 5.5 of the PX  Tariff requires the PX to 
identify such  Participants to all other affected PX Participants by the most 
expeditious means available.? In accordance with Section  5.5, here is a list 
of 
PX Participants not in  compliance with Section 4.3.2. for the SCE default:

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory 
and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as 
follows:

Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, 
it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there 
are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized 
drafts in advance of filing.
RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not 
involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.
On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard 
Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley 
agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I 
mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a 
quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today.

Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be.
As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power.

Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT.

Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.

Thanks.

Jay.

I'm sure Enron's stockholders would want Enron to join a filing to allow
Enron to participate in discussions between the PX and the Chairman of FERC
(and to oppose any ex parte communications) about whether the PX holds
Enron's money.  I would be interested in going to the discussion too.

As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should 
be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection  (e.g., the 
dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to 
"Transmission Service" not interconnection service)  Although I haven't done 
a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 
7.3, and 11.  Also "transmission service" should be capitalized.

Some Other suggestions:

Preamble - Sentence three - delete: "[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do 
not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System."  Insert:  
"These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of 
Transmission Service on the Transmission System."

Sentence four - delete "of the Transmission System"  Parts II and III are 
defined terms.

Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes 
changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that 
"materially affect its interconnection" it can lose its place in the queue.  
Given how much discretion this gives PGE, "materially affect" should be a 
defined term or have a standard for its application.

Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows "The Interconnection 
Customer must execute, complete, and return  . . . "

Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function 
desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection 
procedures. 

Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit 
and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.

Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission 
service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (iii) should be 
changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only 
or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.

Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to 
higher-queued projects end?  Does this extend the 60-day period every time it 
happens?

Section 4.4   

In sentence two - Delete "Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and"

Work the following definitions into Section 4.4:
Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the 
plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an 
existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the 
case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the 
generating plant under good utility practice.
Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities 
required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the 
utility system.  They do not include transmission changes required to deliver 
power beyond the point of interconnection. 

In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission 
Provider's transmission lines and substations and add "Network Upgrades."

Proof-read and correct section numbers.

Subject: Re: Draft interconnection procedure  

Comments:

2.3     Delete last sentence.  If Enron is already in the queue (or 
considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at 
FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to 
remain in the queue.  I don't think this is necessary and all are protected 
because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.

4.3   Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost 
unfortunately).  It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days.  PGE is 
protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a 
notification.

6    ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these 
changes for PGE.)

 6.1  Add after "as modified by the Commission" "if Customer chooses to 
commence construction."
6.2   Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward 
placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make 
reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after 
notification and opportunity to remedy.)

Thanks.

Subject: Draft interconnection procedure

Since EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley 
agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.  As I 
mentioned to you on Friday, PGE is trying to file this week so we have a 
quick turn around time.  I'm going to try to read it today.

Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be.
As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power.

Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT.

Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.

Thanks.

Jay.

I think we should do this but should include some comments praising FERC for 
taking some positive actions and really looking for solutions instead of 
simply ways to reregulate (thank you again Dan Yergin).

Subject: RE: Questions you requested  

The available transmision capacity (ATC) "derate" did occur and has occured 
everydaysince about the 24th.  This fact was verified to me by our ISO 
customer contact on Friday.  Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the 
ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this 
information is verifiable with the ISO.  Our customer contact didn't know 
exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more 
with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.  The 
reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.  The 
line was again rated at zero today.  I have been pursuing the following 
approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.  I've talked to 
Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.  Eric believes he can get 
the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade 
press.  So check the trade press tomorrow.

I agree with Craig ... we need to be really, really careful about the earth 
orbit issues identified below.   We shouldn't talk about the derating issue 
unless we can:   (1) confirm the derating occurred and document it; (2) tie 
the derating directly to action by the new board (i.e., determine that it 
wasn't due to maintenance or some other physical occurence); (3) show a 
direct impact on PNW prices that can't be easily explained in another way; 
and (4) show a continuing pattern (in contrast to an isolated event).

Subject: RE: Questions you requested



 This excellent material, and very important, but it's pretty
esoteric.  If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins, use
Mary's stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB.   Assuming
it's true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission
route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power, and that this raised the
market price in the NW by about $50-75 per megawatt-hour, and that this is
costing the NW $2-5 million per day (at least for the period that Mary
looked at), that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit.  If we can
establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Davis's handpicked
ISO board, the NW Senators will escape Earth's gravitational pull.  For that
very reason, we have to be able to back up anything we say, and we need to
anticipate any defenses the ISO may have.  But if you want NW elected
officials to quit being so polite toward Davis, that will do it.

 Craig

Subject: Questions you requested


Joshua:

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC
so believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional
materials, just let me know.
(See attached file: Ron Wyden Qs for Steve Kean.doc)


In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing
with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder"
management board was created that represented a wide range of market
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the
California Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger
western regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs
are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power
crunch comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during
times of real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to
shoot first and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions
involving out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial
interests sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of
robust, competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions
practically guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered."
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets.

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving 
PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is 
attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering 
if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the 
event of a bankruptcy.

I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it 
(and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's 
cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination 
was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to 
quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for 
purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before 
distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the 
message.

Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the 
filing.  

We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to 
revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct.  Are you 
handling that Sarah or do you want me to?
The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into 
California, that needs to be added.
Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling?  It's my recollection 
that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor, 
under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days.  
Has counsel looked at whether FERC has made special exceptions for mergers?

y, Distributed Generation and Co-generation


> The Governor held his press conference today at the co-generation plant at
> the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento.
> 
> All local TV, print and radio news media outlets sent representatives.
> 
> Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction
> of a legislative package promoting renewable energy, distributed
> generation and co-generation, it quickly turned to how the Governor will
> deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities.  The Governor said
> that it has "become increasingly obvious" to him that the best solution to
> the utilities' financial problems is the "acquisition of transmission
> lines."  He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities "most
> significant asset" and would be something the public would be able to get
> value from "in perpetuity."  He said the arrangement will likely be a
> "lease" of the utilities' lines, with the companies continuing to maintain
> them, "to capture [the utilities'] expertise."  Details of this plan will
> be announced on Friday, the Governor said.  The time and place for this
> announcement have yet to be released.
> 
> The Governor later said he felt the utilities' parent/holding companies
> should "be part of the solution" so there would be "shared pain" in
> reaching a solution.
> 
> The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines
> will involve the sale of revenue bonds, but he "didn't have enough wisdom"
> when asked about it to give a firm answer.  He said he believed he would
> have that wisdom on Friday. 
> 
> The Governor also commented on his plan to police and/or fine business
> establishments that keep their lights on after business hours.  He said he
> would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar. 15, a specific program
> to reduce by 50-70% the amount of energy used by retailers after-hours.
> 
> The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote
> renewable energy, distributed generation and co-generation through
> incentives, rebates and tax credits.  
> 
> The package contains:
> 1.) "Rebate Increase Bill": "Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the
> Renewable Resource Trust Fund" = $50 million to increase rebates for
> renewable distributed generation systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (this
> money will come from the General Fund)
> 
> 2.) Tax Credit Bill: SB 17X (Brulte): A 50% tax credit for the purchase
> and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than
> 10 kilowatts and up to 200 kilowatts for large facilities such as
> apartment complexes and businesses. 
> 
> 3.) Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program: AB 53X (Reyes): $50 million
> for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems,
> distributed generation and co-generation facilities. 
> 
> 4.)Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities: This proposal will
> provide $20 million to achieve 40 MW of reduced peak load through
> retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal
> water districts to improve environmental performance.  This involves
> retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural
> gas technology. 
> 
> 5.)Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less
> than 1 MW from Standby Charges: Elimination of the standby charges paid by
> distributed generation end-use customers to the Investor Owned Utilities.
> This includes small co-generation facilities and only applies to units
> that generate less than one megawatt.

> kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses.
> This will be carried in SB 17x by Senator Jim Brulte (R-Cucamonga). 
> 3.   $50 million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.

Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the 
Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of 
January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available 
transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this 
caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about 
$50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.  
This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity 
is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder 
what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take 
similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if 
there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like "economic" 
force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a 
Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to 
get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are 
more important than the NW's. 

Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis 
using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO 
advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.  
We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses 
transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our 
deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 
MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if 
exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to 
cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't 
thought of.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862.

CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

		 Subject: WSPP report for 3rd quarter

Hi Folks!  For 3rd quarter we'll need to undergo an examination of our 
reporting requirements for WSPP and accordingly, our reporting processes.  
The filing requirements can be found under the " WSPP Library" heading of the 
Current Documents section of the WSPP home page (www.wspp.org).

Basically, we just need to be confident our reports are accurate and we also 
need to be cognizant that if we make significant changes, we should be able 
to anticipate the impact of those changes and send appropriate adjusting 
notification if necessary.  Let's not surprise ourselves or FERC in a big way!

I'm not sure that I am the appropriate staff to head this up, but will be 
happy to provide organization and coordination to the effort until we all are 
happy with the undertaking.

Next week after the close of this month is complete, I will structure a 
project management file on the WSPP reporting and we'll take it from there.  
Please contact me with comments, questions, complaints, x7756.

P.S.
We have filed the 2nd quarter report using the unchanged method.

Subject: RE: WP-02 Cross examination schedule.


 There have been several inquiries about the scheduling of certain
witnesses.  To attempt to accommodate these scheduling issues, there will be
a meeting to discuss the scheduling of cross examination on Thursday April
5, 2001 at 1:30 pm in the Rates Hearing Room, 223, of the 911 Building.  A
telephone bridge has been arranged for those unable to attend the meeting in
person.  The number for the bridge is 503-230-3344.  The Passcode is 7317.
To connect to the bridge, dial the phone number, wait for the double beep,
then dial the Passcode.  If you have trouble connecting to the bridge,
please call the General Counsel Receptionist at 503-230-4201.  Questions
should be directed to Sarah Westenberg at 503-230-4753 or Peter Burger at
503-230-4148.

Chris Foster asked me for help with a Puget Sound Energy tariff that would 
allow us a quasi direct access to Puget's largest customers.  In response to 
his request I am sending him information about who the customers are, so he 
can contact them.

Air Liquide et al v. PSE 

        Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 

        This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of 
a "soft
        cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers. 

        On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint 
answer on
        the rate cap mechanism. 

        On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power 
rates
        paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A
        short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power 
costs
        if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. 

        The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the 
level of the
        temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and 
the
        PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place 
pending
        further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48. 

        Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, 
Air Liquide
        America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and
        Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., 
King
        County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview,
        Qwest and MCI WorldCo

Alan,
 While an open season is useful, I am not sure we need to require it in all 
instances.  If a developer of a generation project needs to build 
transmission to get its energy to market, they should be allowed to build it 
and get FTRs.  This presumes that the builder will have to negotiate the 
obstacle course associated with construction (environmental, reliability, and 
other siting approvals).  There are currently so many safeguards in place and 
building is so difficult, that any requirement for open season may well be 
generated when you try to use scarce right of way to build less than an 
optimal line.  This is exactly the debate going on in this committee, so as 
you say, the devil will reside at details.com.

Steve, Mary:

Other than stating that the "devil is in the details," I am not sure I found 
this that illuminating.

Can I assume that we support giving whoever invests in transmission, any 
identifiable capacity (via FTRs) created by the expansion?  I also assume any 
expansion may need an open season type procedure to make sure the expansion 
is broadly distributed to prevent monopoly power ....

Attached is a presentation of the NYISO Working Group on "Principles of
Market-Based Expansion Process".  It discusses the free rider problem of
market based transmission expansion.  The section titled "The Devil is in
the Details" describes a proposal for paying the transmission investor for
the reinforcement - the transmission investor would receive one half of the
difference in congestion charges between the with and without reinforcement
cases.

This proposal was developed last fall for the NYISO.  More discussions are
planned to determine the feasibility of the proposal.  The contact I have is
Bob Reed of New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, 607 762 7256,

I hope you caught Lysa's error in transcribing this message.  I said you 
should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has not accepted 
a rate or that a rate isn't on file.  Sorry about the double negative.  FERC 
usually speaks in terms of "accepting" rates rather 
than "setting" rates unless it has had a hearing and found that the rates 
being charged are unjust and unreasonable..

Robin & Jeff:

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
gave you yesterday.  

Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
isn't on file".

If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: January 12, 2001

RE: FERC Conference on Market Monitoring in California
       ? Revised Draft
       ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:00 p.m.
         (EST), 1-800-937-6563

Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations
with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding
Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on
January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO
markets.  The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now
delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in
California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market
monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,
opportunity costs and scarcity values.

FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at the
January 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there is
consensus on this approach.  We will discuss this draft on a conference
call on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).  To access the call,
please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  In the
meantime, if you have any questions, concerns or ideas about this effort,
please contact Julie at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org before the call.

Subject: Re: More on the Future of the CAISO


Hi Mary,

Here's the situation as I see it:

DSTAR does indeed still have the bad governance problem to which you
alluded. On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent
Governing Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty
reasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I
think we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that
the Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always
be 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more
likely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws
regarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more
equitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.

But aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about
DSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the
fall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are
all preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to
market; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC
services and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are
much better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are
being preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And
as to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know
what the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in
agreement with our position.

In most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the
result of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of
the Enron physical rights model over the years).

There are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but
overall, we stand to win on most of them.

So: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require
the CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate
authority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could
be up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into
pitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets
rid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by
the state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in
March/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.

I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the 
Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with 
interconnection issues.  You weren't at the meeting when the assignment came 
up so I said you might be interested in the assignment and that I would take 
responsibility for asking you if you wanted the job.  Are you interested?  I 
don't have your phone number.  I'm at 503-464-8862.

We have put together the following list of issues for the request for 
rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input 
about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who 
will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests 
for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.

We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap 
and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit
$150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?)
Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not 
be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts.
The FERC should clarify its statement that "to the extent the IOUs' resources 
exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at 
wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules."  A literal 
interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and 
prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their 
generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options 
but we are concerned about less liquidity.
Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request 
for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from 
Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs.
We oppose the 27-month refund period
We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF)
The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being 
paid the cost of cover for exports

Subject: CPUC DATA REQUEST OF PX


It is my understanding that the CPUC has served a data request on the PX 
seeking market data dating back to 1998.  The parties were given until Friday 
to inform the PX whether they object to the PX turning the information over 
to the CPUC.

Please let me know if you would me to set up a conference to discuss a 
possible group response or do you think that this is something that should be 
dealt with on an individual basis?

This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating 
on.

As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that 
Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you 
will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out 
yesterday.  I will not be attending.  

In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on 
recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has 
been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this 
paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any 
comments on the paper as yet.

Subject: Training on March 7th

The people on the "To" list have been selected to attend an "Energy Math" 
training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the 
River Room at Two World Trade Center.  Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with 
a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday 
morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this 
is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can 
find a replacement.

I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over 
the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the 
needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the 
foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a 
graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several 
people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently 
published.

This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being 
offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris 
Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity 
to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a 
cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of 
experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  
Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others 
are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to 
people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only 
responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give 
constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course 
better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide 
feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or 
don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us 
with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for 
the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list 
for this session.

Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the 
next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to 
improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance 
for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

Subject: Re: GridSouth and Southern RTO Orders  

I talked to a couple of folks at Southern in the last couple of days to find 
out how they are reacting to the FERC Order.  Bill Newman ( Sr. VP 
Transmission ; leads the RTO work on market structure and transmission 
planning) said they were disappointed that FERC did not respond to their 
filing as a declaratory filing, but appeared to be trying to force a filing 
for approval of a proposed RTO.   He said, at this point, they were planning 
to restart discussions with all the parties around Southern to explore 
whether they could get agreement on a larger RTO, but they had not decided 
that combining was necessary.  He also said that it might be easier to 
combine with GridSouth than Entergy, Florida, etc., but it might not work out 
that way.   We discussed the response from FERC concerning the treatment of 
bundled retail.  He was puzzled by the difference in treatment from 
GridSouth, since both appear to have the same practical outcome.

I agree with Sue.  In fact, I don't even think we need to intervene given 
that the ISO did not file a tariff that would become effective.  So unless 
Tim wants to help out the ISO with a supportive filing . . . .

I think we might want to make a neutral or supportive intervention -- because 
we can expect the Hogan forces to come blaring in and we may need to do 
something then.  Especially since my understanding is that the report is 
pretty suppportive of our views.

Nancy,
 We have received two charts attached to the November 9, 2000
prepared statement of Diane Jacob, a San Diego Supervisor, which shows
retail prices per KWH for 1999 and 2000.  In the transcript she refers to
another chart -- one that supposedly shows "outrageously excessive profits
by traders."  It would appear that we have the wrong chart.  The missing
chart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron.
Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon as
possible.  We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.

Thanks
Gary

Your ideas about decertifying the Cal ISO are very interesting but I question 
your likelihood of success given FERC's lack of political will (thanks to 
George W.'s new leadership ) to sue the ISO to get rid of the newly-appointed 
ISO board.

Subject: Re: More on the Future of the CAISO


Hi Mary,

Here's the situation as I see it:

DSTAR does indeed still have the bad governance problem to which you
alluded. On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent
Governing Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty
reasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I
think we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that
the Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always
be 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more
likely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws
regarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more
equitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.

But aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about
DSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the
fall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are
all preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to
market; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC
services and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are
much better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are
being preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And
as to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know
what the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in
agreement with our position.

In most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the
result of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of
the Enron physical rights model over the years).

There are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but
overall, we stand to win on most of them.

So: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require
the CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate
authority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could
be up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into
pitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets
rid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by
the state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in
March/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.

Steve -- I believe that the note from Dan below responds to your request  for 
an outside counsel response concerning the appliability of recent FERC refund 
orders to bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of 
Water Resources (CDWR).  Let me know if you would like a formal opinion 
letter or if there is anything else I might do for you.  Later Joe

		 Subject: Sales to CDWR


The $150 "soft price" cap that FERC adopted in its December 15 order applies 
only to sales of power into the California ISO market and California PX 
day-aheadand day-of markets.  These are the real-time and short-term markets, 
respectively.   By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not apply 
to any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of 
Water Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.

Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability of 
the cap may change in the future.  In a recentlly released report, FERC staff 
recommends that the cap be discontinued after April 2001 and replace by a 
series of other measures to mitigate market power.  Thes include a marginal 
cost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to the 
participating generator agreement.

Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future might 
argue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects the 
same role as was formerly performed by the PX.  Based on that proposiiton, it 
might be argued that a price cap similar to the "soft price" cap  be imposed 
on sales to the CDWR.

Here's a really interesting service summarizing ISO activities.  Also read 
the content about governance and confidential information.  If the PX conveys 
its confidential information to the ISO, it would violate the PX's tariff 
(but what's new?).  On governance, the new directors are hoping that people 
will be results-oriented in deciding whether to challenge them at FERC.

Free KNOW THE ISO service

You recently inquired about subscribing to Phoenix Consulting's California
ISO analysis/reporting service, KNOW THE ISO.  I am writing to let you know
about a special offer available until March 1st only.
.
With any new subscription between now and the end of the month, you can
receive free service for the month of February (including any reports we've
issued so far this month).  Service this month includes Event Reports
covering these important topics:
.
>Stakeholder meetings about:
  -- The ISO's draft generator Market Power Monitoring/Mitigation Proposal
(plus our special report summarizing the ISO's proposal, and the others
offered at the January 23rd FERC technical conference);
.
  -- Proposed changes to the pricing/dispatch order for Imbalance Energy
supplies, and other near-term ISO tariff change proposals;
.
  -- Proposed generator availability standards, and the penalties proposed
for violating them;  and
.
  -- The 2000 ISO Control Area Transmission Expansion Plan.
.
>Meetings of the new state-appointed ISO Board, where the new members will
decide:
  -- Summer 2001 demand-side program bidding results/contract awards;
.
  -- Summer 2001 peaking generation contract results and unit construction
progress;
.
  -- Eligibility of PG&E interruptible end-use customers for ISO demand-side
programs;  and
.
  -- ISO policies regarding Distributed Generation.
.
You'll also be on board to receive our reports for March, when the ISO will
address Congestion Management Reform, dual-fuel requirements for generators,
the New Facilities Connection Policy (for generator/load interconnection
with the grid), and the Long-Term Grid Planning Policy.

KNOW THE ISO subscribers include municipal and investor-owned utilities,
regulatory bodies, ISO Board members, generator owners and developers, law
firms, consulting firms, trade-industry associations, power marketers,
Scheduling Coordinators, retail Energy Service Providers, and consumer
groups.  They receive accurate information about important ISO events within
about 2 days, including our unique insider perspective and explanations, for
less each month than the cost of a single overnight trip to Folsom or an
hour of high-level consulting service.

If you've been meaning to subscribe but just haven't gotten around to
filling out the form, don't worry - just reply to this e-mail message
confirming your decision to subscribe, then follow up with the paperwork
later.  (For your convenience, we've attached another KNOW THE ISO Services
Description Package, with cost information and a subscription form, along
with another couple of free samples.)

We'll add you immediately to our mailing list and send you any reports from
earlier this month (including the special reports on generator market power
monitoring/mitigation).

I look forward to hearing from you.  Please call me at one of the numbers
shown below for answers to any questions you may have.

Depends.  Is EPMI making the sales to the UI end users, or is UI?  If the 
former and if it constitutes one of your 20 largest sales not for resale, 
then it must be included.

Dan,
At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we 
default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or 
tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will 
suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It 
would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  "former"   participant in 
the PX and not a "current" one, ("current" being  the word used in the tariff 
to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, 
to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and 
CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a 
possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy

Subject: Letters to terminate EPMI's CalPX Participation Agreement

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Steve

  When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a "Short" day because an hour is
lost, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for
HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI
Web Workspace to submit schedules.

  The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the "Short" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this "Short" day, Trade Date 4/1/01.

  If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-4420.


  CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition

  The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

  Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

  However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

  If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

 For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

Actually DSTAR is doing very well.  There is a very business mined 
independent board that is very helpful.  We are getting most everything we 
want in the DSTAR arena.  The only problem with the governance of DSTAR is 
that public power tries to dominate the advisory groups to give a front to 
legitimize its votes giving advice to the board.  The board is very aware of 
this and does its job well.  There was discussion with my SWPTF and the 
southwestern jurisdictional utilities to merge DSTAR and California and the 
effort was going very well until senator peace started some of his antics.  
Anyway, DSTARs a very good process right now.

I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) 
should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to 
FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should 
report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our 
wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, 
make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain 
detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior 
that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require 
the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have 
been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on 
any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or 
may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party 
to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the 
alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or 
ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and 
opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: January 12, 2001

RE: FERC Conference on Market Monitoring in California
       ? Revised Draft
       ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:00 p.m.
         (EST), 1-800-937-6563

Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations 
with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding 
Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on 
January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO 
markets.  The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now 
delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in 
California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market 
monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs, 
opportunity costs and scarcity values.

FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at the 
January 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there is consensus 
on this approach.  We will discuss this draft on a conference call on 
Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).  To access the call, please dial 
1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  In the meantime, if you 
have any questions, concerns or ideas about this effort, please contact Julie 
at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org before the call.

Correct.  I wanted to terminate CTS for EPMI too but others decided this 
issue.  Sorry if there was any confusion.  Please make a filing for Portland 
General, consistent with their letter to the PX.  I am still waiting to hear 
from Enron Wind.

Subject: Notice of PX Termination Filed With FERC


The filing made it (time stamped 5:00; my personal latest).  Thus, we are in 
position to receive a 2/1/01 effective date of the termination.

Although we achieved our primary objective, we will unfortunately need to 
file an "errata" tomorrow to (1) attach the EES and EEMC letters of 
termination, which were received too late to be included in the filing, and 
(2) to correct certain collation glitches (of the attachements) that occurred 
during production.

Query: With regard to EPMI, the filing only terminates its Participation 
Agreement in the PX's core markets (day-ahead and day-of).  It does not 
reference CTS.  Is this correct?

Mary: Based upon our conversation earlier today, I was under the impression 
that PGE had previously terminated its arrangements with the PX, so we agreed 
to delete all references to PGE and not make the filing on its behalf.  
However, after the filing was made, I received a copy of the termination 
letter that PGE sent to the PX today. What is PGE's correct status?  (If we 
need to file for PGE, we should do a separate filing for it tomorrow.  I want 
the errata that we are doing tomorrow for EPMI, EES and EEMC to be treated as 
an "errata" to today's filing, so we cannot add new matters.)

Shouldn't we protest this filing at FERC?  Otherwise we'll have to track on a 
day-to-day basis whether we should sell to the ISO.

This ISO amendment was issued on 1/4/01 but I am not sure if anything was  
circulated to folks on the Trading Desk. 

The amendment allows the ISO to relax creditworthiness requirements to the 
utilities on a day to day basis.  A copy of the transmittal letter is 
attached.

The ISO has been invoking its order this week.  See notice issued for

The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement.

In the sixth "whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract 
states that either the generating company or the generating company's 
customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for 
transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and 
therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be 
responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no 
ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission 
service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power 
to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the 
transmission service.  

The eighth "Whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, 
E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the 
generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in 
accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability 
Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some 
generators do not like to commit to the "good utility" practice standard or 
to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I 
doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility 
practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this 
standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to 
form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming.  
If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better 
develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable 
alternative standard.

Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the 
agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become 
effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and 
Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks 
Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have 
done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's 
open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access 
tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point 
portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a 
separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection 
portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT 
applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and 
therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the 
customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to 
wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would 
completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888.

Section 1.2 After, "by both parties" add "however, if the parties cannot 
agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement 
unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT."

Section 1.6.2   Three years advance written notice is too long.  A reasonable 
notice period would be ____.

Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of "Applicable Laws" 
"Applicable Permits" and "Applicable Reliability Criteria" because, when 
combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10, 
3.11, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 11.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and 
E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to 
amendment of the contract by government action.  

Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of "Dispatch gives Sierra too much 
control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for "the most 
reliable" supply.  Change "the most reliable" to "a reliable"

Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT.  It should be written using 
the same words as the OATT.

Section 2.52  The reference to Section 22.1 should be corrected to 21.1.

Section 2.56 Definition of "System Integrity" is too broad.  When combined 
with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not "have an adverse 
impact on "maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the 
general public."  While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities, 
there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we 
should not.

Section 3.5 The proposed Use of "System Integrity" here is more fair assuming 
EPMI agrees to the "Good Utility Practice" standard.

Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word "unplanned" be added before the word Outages?

Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be 
directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others.

Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI  to regulatory risk by allowing 
Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI.    This risk is 
increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for 
such facilities in its sole discretion.  Editorial note: the third to last 
sentence is missing a period.

Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56.

Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an 
opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of 
service already provided by this contract.  Accordingly, the words "or 
ordered by FERC" should be deleted.  

EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's 
approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for 
operation of Sierra's facilities

Section 4.3 Should the words "generating company's applicable FERC-approved 
tariff" be changed to "Applicable Law?"

Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably 
require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not 
increase by more than 10 percent.  Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only 
required to pay actual cost.

Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a 
final invoice.

The words "plus Interest" should be added after the words "difference" in the 
fourth sentence.

Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10 
and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons.

Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence.

Section 7.1 Delete period after the word "and" in last sentence.

Section 8.1.4 Add period after "Interconnection Facilities."

Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection 
facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third 
parties.

Section 8.7.2 Delete the word "and" on the seventh line. 

Section 9.1.1 See comments under Sections 2.56.

Section 11.7 Delete "pen-nits" from last line on page and insert "permits."

Section 11.8  After "remediation or abatement activity" insert "pay all 
fines, penalties, or compensations as required by law."

Section 13.4 There should be a reciprocal provision for generators.

Section 16.2 EPMI opposes "regulatory" Force Majeure.  

Section 16.6 This provision is too broad in that it allows the System 
Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI.

Section 17.9 Add the letter "y" after "and ma" on the second line.

Section 19.2.1 Third to last line change "ahs" to "has."

Section 19.3 Needs to be edited.

Section 19.6 This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment 
to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTO's requirements.  

Section 22.5 By law, System Operator should be required to file with FERC 
prior to terminating the connection.

Section 31.8  This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows 
Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of 
the interconnection contract.  This is standard in utility tariffs and 
agreements and in fact is in the FERC's pro forma OATT under Order No. 888.  

Section 31.9 of the contract retains EPMI's rights to protest any unilateral 
filing by Sierra under Section 31.8 and seems to balance the rights given to 
Sierra in Section 31.8 by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any 
of the rates, terms, or conditions, etc., of the interconnection agreement.

Exhibit D D.1.1 EPMI should not be required to provide free station service 
to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties.  A higher level of 
service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather 
at the agreement of the Parties.   

D.1.2 The phrase "Except under Applicable Law," should be added before the 
first sentence.

D.2 EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level 
determined by Sierra's discretion.  Accordingly, EPMI opposes this entire 
provision.  If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs, EPMI would agree to provide 
______ level of VArs at ____ rate.  EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at 
Sierra's discretion, subject to this rate, in the case of an Emergency.  
Otherwise, EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power 
(instead of VArs) to the market at a market-based rate, and it might be 
subject to having such transactions cut at Sierra's "discretion" without 
being assured the cost of cover.  Accordingly, the rate standard of cost or 
foregone revenues would not be compensatory.

D.3 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to 
require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service.

D.4 Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission 
service, it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service 
including regulation and frequency response service of real-time load 
-following service.  Accordingly, this provision should be deleted.

D.5 EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be 
deleted.  Sierra should get ancillary services from the market.

E.2 Change "minimized" to "minimize."

E.2.4 Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator "may affect 
System Integrity."

E.4.1.3 EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to "approve" 
Planned Outage Schedules.

E.4.4 Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term "System Integrity" 
here as too high as standard.

E.6.5 The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority 
to preclude Planned Outages.

E.7.1 Add the word "the" on line 4 after "at."

E.8.1 EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area 
Operator authorization to undertake any action that is "reasonably likely to 
have an adverse impact of System Integrity," especially adjustment of the 
amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system 
under E.8.1.1.

E.8.2.2 Because VArs could be sold as real power, System Control should not 
be allowed to "establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules."  
Rather, Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage 
support it requires.  See also E.8.9 establishing power factors.

E.8.4 EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits 
but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra.  We need 
to negotiate compensation.

E.8.6 Giving Sierra "sole discretion" to determine "unacceptable 
deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System" is too 
broad.

E.9.2 "Repots" should be "reports"

Market Participants:

The ISO provides this update regarding the Summer 2001 Demand Relief Program
and the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program.  The ISO intends to issue
new solicitations for both programs in the next 1 1/2 weeks.

Two additional RFBs for the Demand Relief Program, one for Loads only and
one for Loads with back-up generators, are scheduled for issuance early next
week with bids due May 1.  They will be posted to our website and noticed by
email.  Based on ISO Governing Board approval on May 10, these Loads will
begin participation in the Demand Relief Program on either June 1 or July 1,
as feasible.

The ISO Governing Board recently approved the design structure of the ISO
Discretionary Load Curtailment Program.  This program will be operable
year-round.  The ISO plans to issue the formal RFP in the next 1 1/2 weeks.
Proposals will be accepted from aggregators on an ongoing basis.

Additional details (subject to some change) can be found in Attachment A of
the ISO Management Memo to the Governing Board dated March 7, 2001 and
titled, Summer 2001 Preparedness Update and Demand Response Programs.  (Note
that pricing for the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program could be
modified in the final design; the ISO expects to initiate the program in the
$250-$500/MWh price range.)

Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to 
bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for

For your review:

Under this rider, service customers selling energy to EPMI at an indexed 
price would be required to reimburse EPMI for any FERC-ordered refunds or 
short payments due to a credit default at the PX/ISO.  Customers selling for 
a fixed price would not be subject to these prior adjustments because the 
customers have no expectation that EPMI will necessarily sell into 
California.

The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always 
been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose 
it.  The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no 
less committed for that reason.  In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in 
the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of 
what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO 
formation and control).

Subject: Re: RTO West Meeting of January 12  

Sean, et al --

My understanding of what Enron wants from an RTO is (a) liquid energy markets 
(spot and forward) and (b) manageable transmission risk.  Of course, there 
are a great deal of sub-issues that need to be implemented for these 
high-level objectives to be met.

I don't disagree that simple solutions make sense for most RTOs given the 
current state of the market (specifically the backlash from California) and 
the politics at FERC about "enforcing" Order 2000 (remember the Order was 
voluntary).  On the other hand, now may be an opportunity to lay the 
framework for really pushing hard on getting the rules right; policies of the 
past have been half-way or incomplete.  Sometimes it takes a crisis for 
policymakers to do the right thing.

Too this point, we are trying to engage the Western Governors and other 
political leaders outside California to continue to drive toward something 
that won't resemble California.

Alan,

Thanks for the update.

I think the amount of time we allocate to the RTO West, and the extent we 
coordinate with other marketers, has to be reevaluated in light of what is 
going on in California.  The California blow up is bound to raise some 
serious concerns in the Northwest (the e-mail from the PPC guy is probably 
the first of many), as well it should.  I think a driving concern we should 
have, particularly now, is that the primary objective of the RRG is to lay 
the framework for a successful market place and to NOT try and solve all 
problems and get mired down in complexities and software limitations.  I 
would argue the intial RTO framework has to be simple and adaptable.  What is 
it exactly Enron wants?  Do we want all control areas collapsed, a ancillary 
service market, a non-contract-path-based congestion management system?  
Why?  How prudent is it to forge ahead while California is in such 
disarray?   Is the goal to just comply with FERC, or to create something that 
will provide a basis for a sound market in (initially) a simple 
easily-understood manner?  Can we get 85% of what we want without multiple 
congestion runs, markets driven by software, weird FTRs, and disconnected 
cash and real-time markets?

I would argue we should advocate simplicity.  What gives us the biggest bang 
for our buck coming out of the gate?  Deal with that, implement it, see how 
it works, adjust as necessary, and then move on.  The danger now is that 
people see California and deregulation as one in the same.  They are not 
going to trust complicated changes, and it is going to be difficult to assure 
them they will work.  We should be able to specifically lay out the top 5 
issues we have with the way the Northwest market is structured now, why it 
costs money and/or is inefficient from a market perspective, and what simple 
steps could be taken to resolve these issues.  I think we should become adept 
at explaining exactly why the California market did not work, and why the 
California market is not synonymous with deregulation and open, competitive 
markets.  We may even want to sponsor some sort of conference.

My bottom line is, I guess, is that I would like us to advocate smart changes 
for the sake of a sound market (even if they are simple and 
straight-forward), and not so much get hung up on what FERC thinks 
open-access is or should be.

Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI 
wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 
50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's 
system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE 
has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  

I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the 
terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI 
could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory 
risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's 
favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you 
would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts 
our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that 
okay?

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: January 12, 2001

RE: FERC Conference on Market Monitoring in California
       ? Revised Draft
       ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:00 p.m.
         (EST), 1-800-937-6563

Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations
with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding
Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on
January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO
markets.  The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now
delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in
California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market
monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,
opportunity costs and scarcity values.

FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at the
January 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there is
consensus on this approach.  We will discuss this draft on a conference
call on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).  To access the call,
please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  In the
meantime, if you have any questions, concerns or ideas about this effort,
please contact Julie at 202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org before the call.

Charles, I'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to you on this.  Since I 
didn't have time to analyze your paper, please see the attached paper on the 
release of information in an RTO.  Also, talk to Alan, I think he provided 
further support for our recommendations in an affidavit he filed at FERC.  
Also, please work with Alan about your comments on page 5.  Alan, if you 
respond through E-mails please copy me.  Thanks.

pre-filing meeting with FERC.

Mary--You may want to check what is said about the Cal power market in this

Lloyd and Aleck, thank you both for the info re: Gen data, I will keep that 
and interject it in the debates.

I have been working with Kurt Conger of American Public Power Assoc on a 
pro-Gen status disclosure paper.  This paper will be proposed to the 
Electronic Scheduling Collaborative for inclusion in the response to the FERC 
OASIS Phase II ANOPR.

Southern Company Mktg is leading the charge to prevent disclosure of such 
data.  This fight is lining up as those marketers with large gen assets vs. 
those who don't.

Transmission customer reps on NERC committees and subcommittees working 
independently outside the NERC process cannot agree on a pro or con position 
however, many support putting these 2 arguments in front of FERC for action.

I will push for filing both the pro and con positions to be filed in the 
ANOPR response.

Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board.  According to the trade 
press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to 
request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market 
redesign.  We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the 
filing because the ISO does not have the authority to act.

As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati=
ng=20
the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's=
=20
Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio=
n=20
that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein=
=20
it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20
suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif=
ic=20
market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law=
=20
enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these=
=20
market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these=20
suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact=20
correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances=
=20
of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during t=
he=20
summer and Autumn of 2000."

Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:

The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because=
=20
FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i=
s=20
a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for=
=20
its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access=
=20
this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying=
=20
marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal=
=20
opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs).
In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery=
=20
rights and establish an appropriate protective order.
There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori=
ty=20
by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20
deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not=
=20
having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.

Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference=
=20
call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answ=
er=20
and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to=20
draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up=
=20
wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,=20
Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from=20

Subject: Re: Summary of FERC's 12- 15 order on California Markets =20

The following are  some  notes and questions regarding FERC's December 15=
=20
Order intended to supplement Mary's notes distributed over the weekend.

1. Penalty on Underscheduled Load=20

a. Penalty threshold

The FERC stood by its Nov 1 recommendation to impose a penalty on all SC's=
=20
that underschedule by more than 5%.  The only change relative to November 1=
=20
is that the FERC will allow SC's with loads 200 MW or less to have up to 10=
=20
MW imbalance without penalty.  EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20
variable load, I assume.  Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO=
=20
on how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=
?)=20
used to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold  is 10 MW or 5%?=
 =20
Guidance from traders would be appreciated.

b. Estimated bills
FERC allows the ISO to implement a blended "automated/manual" process to=20
implement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.  To simplify the settlement=20
process, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=
=20
temporary basis.  Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=
=20
estimated basis?

2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs

The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=
,=20
which will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.  =
In=20
its discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: "In recognition of=
=20
the unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=
=20
the ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it."  Enron will=20
undoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=
g=20
request.  Among other things, EPMI will  argue that opportunity costs are a=
=20
legitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=
=20
and that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20
generator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking

This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=
=20
costs as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20
1/1/01.

As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20
Mary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=
=20
their own power can report "purchase price".  Is West Trading prepared to=
=20
document every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20
"purchase price?"  In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20
marketer--such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=
=20
replacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs--are not allowed on the=20
list.  (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20
rehearing.)

In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=
e=20
allowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.  The only=
=20
concrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=
ed=20
$25/MWh as a "reasonable capacity adder."

Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.  The preliminary=
=20
opinion from our discussion today was that such bids are in a =01&safe harb=
or=018=20
zone and it appears that refund risk on such transactions is much less.

This report is accurate.  For a variety of reasons, CFE (exports to Mexico) 
went to zero.  I agree with the export number to Canada.  If anyone wants to 
know about Mexico, call me, and I'll fill you in on all of the changes they 
made!

Thanks for sending the letter along.  I forwarded it to Mitch Taylor for his 
information and review.  I'm comfortable sending the letter (assuming Mitch 
agrees).  I want to call Steve Oldham first and warn him of the problem.  

I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a 
meeting with Sierra on the PGE transaction that was scheduled for this week 
and may take place next week.    Do we have any idea on what further delay is 
costing us (i.e., $__/month)?

Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and

the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree 
that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with 
FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable 
contracts by 2/28/01.  If we are going to make this demand we need to send 
this letter ASAP.

Subject: Re: Summary of FERC's 12- 15 order on California Markets =20

The following are  some  notes and questions regarding FERC's December 15=
=20
Order intended to supplement Mary's notes distributed over the weekend.

1. Penalty on Underscheduled Load=20

a. Penalty threshold

The FERC stood by its Nov 1 recommendation to impose a penalty on all SC's=
=20
that underschedule by more than 5%.  The only change relative to November 1=
=20
is that the FERC will allow SC's with loads 200 MW or less to have up to 10=
=20
MW imbalance without penalty.  EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20
variable load, I assume.  Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO=
=20
on how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=
?)=20
used to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold  is 10 MW or 5%?=
 =20
Guidance from traders would be appreciated.

b. Estimated bills
FERC allows the ISO to implement a blended "automated/manual" process to=20
implement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.  To simplify the settlement=20
process, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=
=20
temporary basis.  Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=
=20
estimated basis?

2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs

The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=
,=20
which will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.  =
In=20
its discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: "In recognition of=
=20
the unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=
=20
the ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it."  Enron will=20
undoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=
g=20
request.  Among other things, EPMI will  argue that opportunity costs are a=
=20
legitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=
=20
and that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20
generator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking

This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=
=20
costs as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20
1/1/01.

As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20
Mary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=
=20
their own power can report "purchase price".  Is West Trading prepared to=
=20
document every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20
"purchase price?"  In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20
marketer--such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=
=20
replacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs--are not allowed on the=20
list.  (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20

In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=
e=20
allowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.  The only=
=20
concrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=
ed=20
$25/MWh as a "reasonable capacity adder."

Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.  The preliminary=

opinion from our discussion today was that such bids are in a =01&safe harb=
or=018=20
zone and it appears that refund risk on such transactions is much less.

I have only a couple of suggestions.  See red-line strike-out attached.  On 
the GenTie Agreement, are we not concerned about the results of third party 
review?  If we are, we should have the same third party review language (with 
my revision) as in the FS Agreement.

Subject: Antelope Valley - SCE System Impact and Tie-Line Impact Studies

I'm following up on my email to you of 2/1 (attached below).

David, it's my understanding from our call last week that we do not have a 
balance sheet or other accounting issue involved with these studies so long 
as we are not committing to any construction or other hard costs.  I've 
reviewed the agreements and confirmed that the only commitment being made by 
Antelope Valley Energy Facility, LLC, our project company  ("AVEF") is to pay 
$50,000 as the cost of each study (which amount can't be increased unless 
AVEF agrees).  So it seems we are ok from an accounting standpoint - 
correct?  Please also confirm from an accounting standpoint that it is still 
acceptable, as we did with the initial Facilities Study Agreement with SCE 
for the project, that AVEF be the contract party with SCE.

Mary, do you have any comments or concerns from a regulatory standpoint?

The commercial team needs to sign both these agreements and submit them back 
to SCE this week, so please get back to me or Dean as soon as you can.

Thanks,
Karen

Roger and David, 
I am hearing that there may be a hard cost/soft cost issue involved with 
interconnection system impact studies and/or tie-line studies, even though it 
seems that the work we would be paying for is engineering.  Please see the 
draft agreements that Dean forwarded to me (attached below) for the Antelope 
Valley development project, and let me know if we have such issues here.

Mary,
Can you please review the agreements and provide any comments back to me?  
What is the current thinking, from a regulatory standpoint, on whether we 
apply in the project company's name or in ENA or EPMI's name?  Roger and 
David, is your analysis of the above issue impacted by which entity is the 
party requesting the studies?

Thanks, everyone, for your assistance.

We have received two proposed contracts from SCE for Dave to sign.  One is 
the mandatory study to determine the SCE system impacts resulting from AVEF

the other is a study to determine the cost for SCE to construct and own the

We need to proceed with both agreements - please take a look and let me know

OK.  I'll see you Friday.  I will bring some sort of salad ... probably 
pasta, unless you need some other kinds of dishes, like a dessert or 
appetizer.

>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 3/26/01 12:43:25 PM >>>


Come after work.

What would you like to bring?

Directions from the Junction of Interstate 5 and Rt. 217:

Take Kruse Way ( Rt. 217 ) east from I-5.
(towards Lake Oswego until Kruse Way ends at L. Boones Ferry Rd)
Turn right onto Lower Boones Ferry Rd.
(follow sign for Lake Grove Dist. / Tualatin ).
Go straight less than 
 mile to the 3rd light at Bryant Rd. and Firwood.
(Bryant Rd. is on the left, Firwood is on the right)
(Albertsons and a Texaco are on the right, 2 banks on the left)
Turn left onto Bryant Rd.
Go straight to the 2nd stop sign.
(at Lakeview after crossing the R.R. tracks right before the 7 Eleven)
Turn left onto Lakeview.
Go straight to the first stop sign.
(at South Shore Blvd.)
Turn right onto South Shore Blvd.
Go "straight" - South Shore winds around a lot - a little over 
 mile to 
Cedar Rd. on the right.
(if you get to a stop sign - at Westview - you've gone too far)
The order of streets - on the right only - coming up to Cedar are: Canal, 
Kelok, and Cedar.
Turn right onto Cedar Rd. to: 17110 Cedar Rd.
Our house is the second paved driveway on the left. (about 50 feet from S. 
Shore Blvd.)

I'd love to come on Friday. Just let me know what time and I will probably
need directions again. Was hoping I'd have a chance to say goodbye ...
other than some RTO meeting. Any particular kind of food you'd like me to
bring?

>>> < Mary.Hain@enron.com > 3/25/01 4:25:54 PM >>>

I know, just when I was starting to get a little better at it. I'm having
a potluck at my house Friday night if you'd like to come.

Robin & Jeff:

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
gave you yesterday.  

Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
isn't on file".

If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone 
(503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.

Ron - Mary has asked that the document you reference be faxed to her in 
Houston (she is attending meetings there).  I will be out of the office 
Friday.

Would you please fax the document to her at:

281-364-6274.  This is the number for the Woodlands Resort.  The phone 
number, in case you need it, is 281-367-1100.

Subject: Response to PX Answer to Chargeback Complaint


Just a note to let you know that we are close to sending out our draft 
response to the PX's answer and hope to do so tomorrow morning.  We would 
like to hold a conference call on Monday afternoon at 3:00 (eastern) to 
discuss.  Our objective is to file on Tuesday, which should be sufficient 
since the complaint has not been scheduled for next week's meeting.

We will send the call-in information for Monday's conference call when we 
circulate the draft tomorrow.  Please let me know ASAP if you would prefer a 
different time on Monday for the call.

Also, let me know if I left off any of your colleagues or clients from this 
email list, or included anyone twice.  This list is limited to the nine 
parties that joined in our complaint.

Thanks.  Ron

CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual
charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you
know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual
charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.

Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and 
Richard will be discussing this this afternoon.

The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the 
ISO was viewed as cooperating.

Subject: CAISO Notice: Message to Market Participants and Scheduling Coord 
inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas -- FOR 
YOUR INFORMATION

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a 
court tells them not to.  DO we care about this?

Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC-- given 
the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info?

Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's 
request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC claims 
identify those who have abused market power.

inators regarding CA ISO compliance with the EOB and CPUC subpoenas


To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff
section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC
subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly,
the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20
unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator
unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4
which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is
providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the
requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the
past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an
outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by
Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a
request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current
requests.

 To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ISO received a subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB")
Friday afternoon.  The subpoena is attached.  The subpoena requires response
by today. The ISO will mark as confidential documents it produces to the EOB
that contain information subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential
treatment in accordance with the EOB's prior agency opinion letters
discussing treatment of confidential information. Concerns related to the
subpoena should be directed directly to the Electricity Oversight Board. The
EOB contact related to the subpoena is Eric Saltmarsh who can be reached at
(916) 322-8601.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any
concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol, at jsole@caiso.com and Norma

I have looked on APS' OASIS for the substations you mentioned.  The only one 
listed as a receipt point was Moenkopi.  Below is a list of the other receipt 
points available.  I'll be out next week but if you need help looking to see 
if transmission capacity is available Diana, Paul, or Cara may be able to 
help you.

Mary, I am working with Jeff Golden and Marc Pana in EES Corporate 
Development. Marc asked me to send you a list of potential substations for 
interconnection of mobile generation in blocks of 25 MW to 50 MW. Here is a 
tentative list. Please feel free to suggest any other location you think is 
suitable for trading power in Palo Verde (either directly or with power 
displacement). Thanks for your attention.

I'm sure Enron's stockholders would want Enron to join a filing to allow 
Enron to participate in discussions between the PX and the Chairman of FERC 
(and to oppose any ex parte communications) about whether the PX holds 
Enron's money.  I would be interested in going to the discussion too.

Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to 
number 8 to be corrected to only include information for the WSCC?  

We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have 
forwarded your data requests to the following people at Enron Wind who I hope 
will be able to help you:  John Lamb, Michael Payne, and Hap Boyd.  Their 
addresses are: Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hap 
Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, John Lamb/EWC/Enron@ENRON

Subject: Response to FERC Data Request for Bulk Power Investigation


Thank you for your timely response to FERC's data request.  To date, I have 
received responses to questions 2-8.  The only oustanding items are responses 
to question #1 and a portion of #4 (unit identifier).  It is understood that 
the responses for #1 will be availalbe after September 15 and the additional 
information for #4 will be available this week.  We will look over your 
responses and call you if clarification or additional information is 
necessary.  We will treat as you requested #2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 as Confidential.

You were correct is responding only to the WSCC.  We did not purovidea 
separate data requests to Enron Wind.  In not doing so, what information are 
we missing from our data requests?  Please e-mail me a response to this 
questions.  For any other concerns please continue to use e-mail or contact 
me at 202-208-2493.

I will not be attanding this meeting as I understand you both will be.  I'm 
sure we have many other specific concerns (and I am reviewing the amended 
supplemental compliance filing as I'm sure you are).  However, I think our 
key concern is returning to a stakeholder process.  Since the utilities first 
filing, we haven't been allowed to be at the table.  This violates Order No. 
2000.

Subject: REGIONAL RTO WEST MEETING ON DECEMBER 15 AT SHERATON PORTLAND 
AIRPORT HOTEL


Hello, Everyone -

Most of the dust has settled from the flurry of RTO West filings, motions,
interventions, comments, protests, and answers that have consumed all of our
attention over the past few weeks. In looking through the list of filed
documents on the RTO West website, one can't help but be struck by the
incredible amount of hard work that has gone into the analysis and drafting
of the documents submitted to FERC.  We appreciate the dedication of
everyone to making the RTO West proposal as strong as possible.

Now that we've had a few days to relax (just kidding), it's now timely for
us to come together to determine where we've been, where we are now, and
where we'd like to go in the future.  To get started, the RTO West Filing
Utilities invite you to an open regional meeting next Friday, December 15,
2000 at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel, Mt. Hood Rooms A & B.  (Let's
start out on familiar territory.)  The meeting will start at 9:30 a.m. and
end at 2:30 p.m.  The Filing Utilities would like you to join them for an
informal buffet lunch so we can maximize the amount of discussion time
together.  I hear rumors that there will be festivities appropriate to the
occasion.

Our working agenda for the meeting is:

1. Opening remarks and welcome from the Filing Utilities

2. Overview of Stage One filings

3. Proposed Stage Two deliverables

4. Stage Two participation by interested parties

 a.  Lessons learned from Stage One
 b. Discussion of guiding principles for Stage Two process

 LUNCH  -  Roundtable discussions as we enjoy the Sheraton's "Oregon Buffet"

 c. Reports and feedback (verbal) from the Roundtables

5. Next steps and proposed meetings

If you have suggestions for what we might add to the working agenda, please
let me know.   Also, to give the Sheraton an approximate estimate of meals,
please let me know by reply e-mail or call Judy Welch at (503) 262-9421 if
you plan to attend.

We look forward to seeing you next Friday.

Thanks very much,

Bud

The PUC's move could make utility bankruptcies more palatable to state=20
officials because it ensures payment for future power supplies. "Now, if we=

ss=20
risk to the general public of mass power disruptions," said state Sen. Debr=
a=20
Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.=20
PG&E, arguing that the PUC didn't go nearly far enough, said it will demand=
=20
the panel reconsider.=20
"Today's =01( actions, while providing a welcome dose of realism in the ene=
rgy=20
policy debate, unfortunately do not resolve any of the key issues facing=20
California's policymakers," PG&E President Gordon Smith said.=20
Smith said the decision could worsen California's energy problems by forcin=
g=20
the utilities to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which is buyi=
ng=20
power on the utilities' behalf, ahead of other creditors.=20
An Edison vice president, Bruce Foster, said the rate increase "is a step i=
n=20
the right direction" but added, "Only time will tell if it's enough." The=
=20
company announced it will start making interest payments on defaulted bond=

and bank debts.=20
Edison and PG&E both criticized the commission for sharply lowering the PUC=

estimates of the utilities' debts.=20
PUC commissioners acknowledged they have more work to do to resolve=20
California's energy mess - and some hinted that additional rate hikes may b=
e=20
in the offing.=20
"Have we gotten the number right? I don't know," said Commissioner Henry=20
Duque. But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the $4.8 billion will be enough=
=20
to pay California's ongoing power bills.=20
Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes.=20
"We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a=

decision," Davis said. "Until we do, I cannot support any rate increase. =

Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis' approval - three of it=

members are Davis appointees - and last Friday his aides shared data with=
=20
business lobbyists indicating rates would rise substantially, said Jack=20
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association=
.=20
Consumer advocates blasted rate increases as a surrender to the power=20
generators that control much of California's electricity.=20
Noting that the state's grid operator has accused the generators of=20
overcharging Californians by $6.2 billion, they urged the PUC to focus its=
=20
firepower on those "robber barons on steroids," as Berkeley activist Barbar=

"It's like dealing with the mob," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for=20
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "Instead of breaking our fingers, they're goi=

Jamming the PUC's auditorium to near capacity, activists said the state=20
should seize the generators' power plants. They razzed the commissioners wi=
th=20
taunts of "blood money!" and "it's a sham," prompting guards to escort some=
=20
protesters out.=20
PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters, saying the=20
generators are "the real culprits in our energy crisis." But she said the=
=20
commission had to approve rate hikes.=20
The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power=20
generators to refund some of their profits. Lynch said the rate hikes would=
=20
be refunded to customers if generators are forced to surrender money.=20
The higher rates will generate $2.51 billion in additional yearly revenue f=
or=20
Edison and $2.28 billion for PG&E, according to PUC estimates.=20
But with most of the money going to reimburse the state Department of Water=

repay the billions the utilities owe to generators and other creditors.=20
"You still have $14 billion, maybe more, of costs that haven't been paid fo=

The two utilities have defaulted on billions of debts and face a daily thre=

"That's still an issue that ultimately has to be addressed," said Senior Vi=

Davis is negotiating to buy the transmission grid from Edison, PG&E and San=

Diego Gas & Electric Co. as a means of paying off the utilities' existing=
=20
debts. But Bowen, the Energy Committee chair, said she doubts the deal will=
=20
go through.=20
Beyond complaining the PUC didn't solve the existing-debt issue, the=20
utilities were dismayed by a change in PUC accounting that sharply lowers=

estimates of their debts and could have major impacts on how much control=
=20
regulators keep over their operations for months to come. Even though rates=

keep going up, a state ordered rate freeze remains technically in effect, a=

that freeze gives regulators ammunition to argue that utilities can't pass=

all their costs on to customers.=20
PG&E's Smith called it the "most egregious" commission action. Edison calle=
d=20
it "illegal."=20
The board voted to raise rates 3 cents a kilowatt-hour - and make permanent=
 a=20
1-cent increase approved in January. Documents from Lynch's office said rat=
es=20
would rise on average 29 percent, but Lynch later described it as 26 percen=
t.=20
The PUC put off a decision on how the higher rates will affect each custome=
r=20
category, other than to say it's leaning toward a system that will charge=
=20
more for electricity consumed above a certain threshold. The PUC estimated=
=20
that 45 percent of residential ratepayers - those who use less than that=20
threshold - will see no rise at all. Lynch proposed some businesses would s=

rate hikes of as much as 87 percent.=20
"How much conservation will this get us? It will depend very much on how it=

Institute.=20
The rate hikes won't affect customers of municipal utilities such as=20

The PUC vote may do little to help the hundreds of alternative-energy=20

The PUC on Tuesday ordered PG&E and Edison to start paying these producers =

"This is not a solution," cogenerators' lawyer Jerry Bloom said of the PUC=

vote. "It will drive additional (plants) off the system."=20
California can ill afford to lose suppliers. On Tuesday, the Independent=20

And many experts believe California won't be able to avoid blackouts this=

For all the talk of electricity rates going up across the state, there's a=
=20
way every resident of California can avoid the price hit altogether: Just u=
se=20
electricity sparingly.=20
A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesda=
y=20
does not affect households that use less than 130 percent of a baseline=20
amount of power.=20
Forty-five percent of households already stay within that limit, according =
to=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch. The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric's territory - 42 percent, utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said.=
=20
The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season=

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUC-approv=
ed=20
increase but is planning to raise rates this spring, as well. It, too,=20
proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of=
=20
kilowatt-hours used over baseline. District rate administrator Alan Wilcox=
=20
said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power=
.=20
Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back=
=20
their electricity use.=20
How difficult might that be? If you're accustomed to using a central air=20
conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat, it could be=
=20
difficult, by Wilcox's reckoning.=20
"If you're running an air-conditioning load in the Valley, you could probab=
ly=20
expect to get into that second tier (above baseline) a little bit," he said=
.=20
"There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or=
=20
have swamp coolers or just go without."=20
In SMUD territory, the baseline is 700 kilowatt-hours per month in summer,=
=20
and 620 kwh in winter for most customers. (Households that do not use gas a=
nd=20
are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance.)=20
Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption - at least, it w=
as=20
the average when the baseline was set in the early 1990s. Consumption has=
=20
crept up a bit since, to 752 kwh a month last year.=20
Under SMUD's rate-increase proposal, the summertime rate would remain at=20
8.058 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 700 kwh. The price would rise b=
y=20
10 cents a kilowatt-hour for the next 300 kwh used, up to 1,000 kwh.=20
Big energy consumers would pay more than 16 cents for each kwh used over=20
1,000 kwh.=20
Bottom line: The biggest users pay the most.=20
Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC - which will affect PG&E=
=20
customers, as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San=20
Diego Gas & Electric - have yet to be worked out, but the rates are expecte=
d=20
to be structured in a similar tiered fashion.=20
Currently, PG&E customers year-around pay 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour up t=
o=20
the baseline limit, and 13 cents for every kilowatt-hour over baseline. The=
=20
average baseline throughout the territory is between 300 and 400 kwh, Tabor=

said; it varies from region to region to account for climate.=20
Tabor said the PG&E baseline amounts to between 50 percent and 60 percent o=

the average electricity use per household in a given territory. That=20
proportion, she said, was taken from a "Lifeline" program in effect from 19=

SAN FRANCISCO -- State regulators yesterday approved the biggest rate=20
increase in California history for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electri=

and Southern California Edison, but Gov. Gray Davis said the increase is=20
premature.=20
The governor, appearing to soften his long-standing opposition, said he wou=
ld=20
support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate=20
increase is "necessary for the good of the state."=20
The Public Utilities Commission, controlled by Davis appointees, voted 5-0=
=20
for an immediate rate increase. A statement from Davis, who usually demands=
=20
that appointees reflect his policy, did not say whether he would ask the PU=

"He can ask," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "That is one of=

The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for =

rate increase. SDG&E has a debt of $681 million but has been paying all of=
=20
its bills, unlike PG&E and Edison. Those companies say they have debt of $1=
3=20
billion.=20
SDG&E is in a different situation because its rates were capped by=20
legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt, allowing the=
=20
utility to borrow. The bills of SDG&E customers soared last summer when the=
=20
utility became the first to be deregulated.=20
"Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PG&E, we would hope=

they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of 2.3 cents p=

Consumer groups warned that out-of-state generators, who have been ordered =

The rate increase approved for PG&E and Edison yesterday is 3 cents per=20

=20
increase amounting to a 40 percent rise are inaccurate.=20
Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about 2=
6=20
percent if applied across the board. She bases her figure on the total bill=
=20
that includes electricity, transmission, distribution and other costs.=20
The media's characterization of the rate increase as 40 percent is based on=
=20
only the cost of electricity, not the total bill. The electricity costs=20
before the increase were 7.2 cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and 6.7 cen=
ts=20
for PG&E. SDG&E's rate is 6.5 cents.=20
Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed tha=

the state, which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in=20
mid-January, will have to spend more than expected. A state plan to lower=
=20
costs through long-term contracts will fall short this summer.=20
The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month to buy power. The PU=
C=20
also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly=
=20
bill collected by utilities, which will be used to finance a bond of $10=20
billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases.=20
The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected befor=
e=20
summer, when heat drives up the demand for electricity. A number of small=

generators that provide a quarter of the state's power are not operating=20
because they have not been paid by utilities.=20
The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PG&E to begin paying the small=
=20
generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of=20
natural gas at the Oregon border, rather than at the Southern California=20
border with Arizona. Prices at the Arizona border have been 50 percent=20
higher.=20
David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents=
=20
50 small generators, said many of the small plants in Southern California=
=20
will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the=
=20
Arizona border.=20
"Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate," Fogarty=20
warned.=20
Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal "qualifying=20
facilities" program since November. PG&E has been paying them only about 15=

The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the $1.5 billion they owe to=

the small generators. Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers=
=20
said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they ca=
n=20
pay their debts.=20
Many of the small generators produce power from "renewable" sources such as=

solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. But most of the small generators use=
=20
natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes.=20
Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompt=

by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation. Davis aides told=20
reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of=

his PUC appointees to delay the increase. An Edison official said the utili=

The two commissioners appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson, Richard Bilas a=

production.=20
The list of ideas Barton sent to subcommittee members was aimed at boosting=
=20
power generation and transmission in the West, increasing conservation and=
=20
preparing for blackouts.=20
Some of the production and transmission measures called for quickly expandi=
ng=20
a crucial power conduit in the Central Valley known as Path 15, using feder=
al=20
funds for all or part of the project; allowing small power generators to se=
ll=20
electricity to buyers other than the state's cash-strapped utilities; and=
=20
establishing standards for allowing businesses with on-site electricity=20
generation to send surplus supplies to the power grid.=20
Other steps, sure to be unpopular with environmentalists, could be taken if=
 a=20
state declares an "electricity emergency." In addition to the idea of=20
harnessing the energy from nuclear-powered Navy ships and submarines, they=
=20
include temporarily waiving nitrogen oxide emission limits at power plants,=

allowing the construction of generating plants on federal and Indian lands,=
=20
restarting mothballed nuclear reactors and delaying for a year a plan to=20
divert water in California's Trinity River from power generation to=20
environmental restoration.=20
On the conservation side, Barton proposed allowing states to lengthen=20
daylight savings time and requiring federal facilities to reduce energy use=

by 10 percent.=20
Finally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be directed to open =
an=20

outages.=20
Barton has been skeptical of the idea of having the federal government limi=
t=20
the cost of wholesale power in the West and did not include that among his=
=20
proposals. Instead, he said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should=
=20
investigate whether wholesale prices are "unjust and unreasonable" -- a=20
finding FERC already has made once.=20
That drew the criticism of four California Democrats -- Reps. Henry Waxman =

"He's left off the 10-ton gorilla solution, which is directing the FERC to=

said.=20
The Democrats also said that Barton's proposals would "undermine the Clean=

proclaiming that "the time to act is now."=20
Despite that pledge, though, he held out little hope of any speedy relief f=
or=20
the hard-hit state. He also restated his opposition to energy price control=
s.=20
The president, who has previously addressed the energy crunch only in answe=
rs=20
to reporters' questions, used a "state of the economy" speech to a business=
=20
group at Western Michigan University to elaborate on his still-evolving=20
energy policy.=20
He broke no new ground in his remarks, but seemed to be reacting to West=20

finding a solution to the rolling blackouts plaguing the nation's most=20
populous state.=20
"The energy problem wasn't created overnight and we won't solve the problem=
=20
overnight," he said. "But we will at least start down the right road so tha=
t=20
the shortages we face today will not recur year after year."=20
He said a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney will come up with=
 a=20
long-term strategy, but he ruled out any move by his administration that=20
would remedy the crisis quickly.=20
"We'll not solve the energy problem by running the energy market from out o=

Washington, D.C.," he said. "We will solve the energy problem by freeing th=
e=20
creativity of the American people to find new sources of energy and to=20

more cleanly."=20
He singled out for criticism any call that Washington cap energy prices.=20
"This administration does not, and will not, support energy price controls,=
"=20
he said to applause from the business-oriented audience. "Price controls do=
=20
not increase supply, and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls=

He portrayed the energy crisis as a clear threat to his hopes of revitalizi=

the national economy.=20
And he signaled that he understands Californians are facing hardships.=20
"The lights are dimming in California. Consumers and businesses in Californ=

He said the blame for the problem belongs to previous decision-makers.=20
"Our people are paying a high price for years of neglect. And the time to a=

ROBERT DURELL / Los Angeles Times





?????SAN FRANCISCO--With protesters jeering their disapproval, besieged=20
utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the=
=20
state's history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights =
on=20
for millions of customers.
?????The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an=20
increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. That will boost rates by as much as=
=20
42% for some Southern California Edison customers and up to 46% for some=20
served by Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
?????The rate increase, which will cost customers nearly $5 billion a year,=
=20
takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at lea=
st=20
May.
?????The rate hike is the most far-reaching and politically volatile action=
=20
the state has taken thus far to ease an 11-month-old power crisis that has=
=20
nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts. But=20
critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale=
=20
electricity prices.
?????"The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that=
=20
are unjust and unreasonable," said commission President Loretta Lynch. "We=
=20
maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on. . . . I believe that=20
adding another 3 cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues."
?????The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state=20
Department of Water Resources for the nearly $3 billion in power it has=20
purchased for them since mid-January.
?????The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from=
=20
alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to=20
operate. The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by=
=20
loss of power from such companies.
?????But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU=
C=20
headquarters. And the drama of the vote--and the vocal opposition--spurred=
=20
each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action.
?????"These are extraordinary moments in California's history," declared=20
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, a recent appointee of Gov. Gray Davis. "And=20
extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage. Loretta Lynch has take=
n=20
a lot of bad hits. But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in=
=20
California."

?????Rate Increase Lacked Support
?????Lynch proposed the rate increase, even though an administrative law=20
judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUC's o=
wn=20
consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, opposed it. She=
=20
also did not have the public support of Davis, who appointed her and two=20
other commissioners.
?????Davis has distanced himself from the PUC's action, saying the commissi=
on=20
was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa=
se=20
is necessary.
?????Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilas--who were appointed by=20
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson--called the rate hikes long overdue.
?????"Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this=20
summer, we have to start paying our power bills," Duque said. "It cannot be=
=20
done with the current rates."
?????Saying "there is just no blood left in the turnip," Bilas warned that=
=20
"absent an immediate rate increase, the utilities will be in Bankruptcy=20
Court."
?????Before the vote, sign-carrying protesters chanted, "Rate hikes, no way=
,=20
make the energy companies pay." And the commission heard a parade of=20
witnesses, most opposing the rate increase. Some called on the state to use=
=20
eminent domain to seize power plants, as Davis said he might do as a last=
=20
resort.
?????Doug Heller, of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San=
ta=20
Monica, told the commission, "Go to these power pirates and tell them the=
=20
state treasury is not their money orchard."
?????Barbara George, of Women's Energy Matters, said, "We should give the=
=20
generators 24 hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave." Geor=
ge=20
was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting.
?????At a hearing Monday, representatives of agriculture and manufacturing=
=20
industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the=20
California economy.
?????The rate hike is the state's largest, according to the Office of=20
Ratepayer Advocates, which researched the issue.
?????Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly=
=20
utility bill, the overall effect will be about a 28% increase in monthly=20
bills, said PUC staff.
?????Before the PUC action, homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid=
=20
7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity and another 5.3 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour for other services. The new rate, totaling 15.5 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour, boosts the overall bill by about 24%. The increase is about=
=20
26% for PG&E residential customers. But under Lynch's proposal, those=20
increases would not be applied equally.
?????To encourage conservation, she seeks a tiered system that would charge=
=20
miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the=
=20
new higher rates on bigger users.
?????The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use 30% or=
=20
more beyond a so-called baseline amount, which is about half of the average=
=20
residential use per month and varies by region.
?????Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by=
=20
the PUC in hearings over the next month. Under Lynch's proposal, nearly hal=
f=20
of all residential customers would be spared rate increases.

?????Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving
?????Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation, but they=
=20
disagree about how much.
?????Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power, said utilities have long used tiered=
=20
rates when charging low-income customers. "So this is not brand new. It's=
=20
just a more aggressive use of it," he said.
?????UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates=20
would do much to stave off blackouts. The greatest conservation gains come=
=20
from investment in efficient appliances, he said, and that's why tiered rat=
es=20
are "no magic bullet."
?????The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the=20
earliest, said Paul Clanon, chief of the PUC's energy division.
?????The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t=
he=20
new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated=20
retroactively and charged to future bills, Clanon said.
?????Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at=
=20
the question of whether the rate hike will be enough.
?????"Have we gotten the number right?" Duque said. "I don't know. I hope w=
e=20
have. But this is a step in the right direction, and we'll return any money=
=20
not used to buy power."
?????Bruce Foster, a Southern California Edison vice president, also said t=
he=20
rate increase is a step in the right direction. "Only time will tell," he=
=20
said, "if it is sufficient to meet the need."
?????In a statement, PG&E welcomed the PUC action as a "dose of realism," b=
ut=20
said the commission left unresolved a host of issues, including how much=20
money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for=
=20
PG&E customers.
?????The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional $4.8=
=20
billion annually from the 24 million people served by Edison and PG&E.
?????But that amount doesn't go far in today's California wholesale=20
electricity market.
?????The state and utilities spent $5.2 billion in January buying=20
electricity. The state, through the Department of Water Resources, has spen=
t=20
nearly $3 billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the=20
utilities since Jan. 19 because power generators refused to sell to the=20
cash-strapped utilities.
?????Money utilities collect from their customers, even with the new rate=
=20
hike, is expected to cover a wide array of expenses, including payments on=
=20
$10 billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spri=
ng=20
to cover the state's cost of buying power.
?????"The numbers don't add up," said Jason Zeller, an attorney with the=20

With Energy Crisis Far From Over, Experts Say More Hikes Possible=20

Power: PUC action leaves questions unanswered, such as how to handle=20
utilities' debts, whether to buy grid.=20

By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????As painful as Tuesday's electricity rate increase will be for some=20
consumers, power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is=
=20
not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and=
=20
threatened its economy.
?????Because of that, still more rate hikes are possible, they say.
?????Consumer advocates, power company officials, legislators and regulator=
s=20
disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the state's problems. But th=
ey=20
agree that California's energy woes are dizzyingly complex. And the rate hi=
ke=20
makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem.
?????"Is it over? Heavens no!" said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los=20
Angeles), who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power=
=20
supply issues. "It's a necessary step, but we're certainly not out of the=
=20
woods yet."
?????The increase, along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC,=
=20
did resolve two major issues--how the state will continue to buy electricit=
y=20
that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how=20
electricity consumers will repay California's treasury for those purchases.
?????But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions: what to =
do=20
with the roughly $14 billion in debt the state's two biggest utility=20
companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power; whether the=20
state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own; where=
=20
to find about $1.5 billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative=20
energy, many of whom have not been paid in months; and how to wrap up=20
negotiations to sign long-term contracts with generators to supply power in=
=20
years to come.
?????Said PUC President Loretta Lynch: "Until we can get wholesale prices=
=20
under control and get folks to conserve, we're going to be in this pickle f=
or=20
a while."
?????Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was=
=20
crucial because the state is spending $45 million to $55 million a day to b=
uy=20
electricity. To cover those costs, the state is supposed to float bonds,=20
which would be repaid from electricity bills. But without the higher rates,=
=20
officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments. And=20
without the bonds, all state taxpayers--and not just customers of the priva=
te=20
utilities--would be on the hook for the debt.
?????In addition to raising rates, the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula th=
at=20
will determine the size of the bond issue, expected to be the largest of it=
s=20
kind in U.S. history.
?????The formula allows for $12 billion in bonds. The state's three major=
=20
private utilities, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and S=
an=20
Diego Gas & Electric, will have to determine how much power the state is=20
buying for them--the figure is roughly 30%--and use a proportionate amount =
of=20
the money they collect from customers to pay the state back.
?????A $12-billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimate=
s=20
that pegged it at $10 billion. But even the larger number is far less than=
=20
some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state=
=20
is buying.
?????Unless prices are stabilized, state Treasurer Phil Angelides and other=
s=20
have warned, further bond issues may be needed. Those, in turn, could requi=
re=20
more rate increases.
?????"It's possible that, with the rate increase and if we do a good job wi=
th=20
conservation, it's possible that [the bonds] may be less," said state Sen.=
=20
Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Ray). "It's also possible that, given the situati=
on=20
this summer, where we have not been able to secure anything close to our=20
power needs . . . we could be paying significantly more."
?????The rate increase, which kicks in only for customers who use=20
significantly more power than a "baseline" amount, is intended to ease the=
=20
situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demand--forcing=20
"energy hogs" to switch off spa pumps or pay the price, as Lynch put it.
?????But no one can predict how the "hogs" will respond or whether the rate=
=20
hike--plus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the=
=20
completion of several new power plants this summer--will be enough to spare=
=20
the state from forced outages.
?????Tuesday did little to fuel optimism. Despite temperatures far milder=
=20
than on a typical summer day, another Stage 2 energy alert was declared by=
=20
the state's Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply. The=
=20
state avoided blackouts, "but it was really close," a Cal-ISO spokeswoman=
=20
said.
?????Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months=
=20
with no outages, but private forecasters see at least 20 hours of blackouts=
.=20
And Reliant Energy, one of the power plant owners, predicts 1,100 hours of=
=20
blackouts in the state this year.
?????Beyond the problems of supply, the state has still not resolved the=20
question of the utilities' debt. Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $1=
4=20
billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices=
=20
that the state's deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers.
?????Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an=20
additional $4.8 billion in revenue annually, most of that will go to paying=
=20
off bonds and other expenses. None is earmarked to relieve the utilities'=
=20
debt.
?????"When you do the math, the amount of money just doesn't get you very=
=20
far," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek).
?????That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the=
=20
picture. Gov. Gray Davis wants the state to pay $7 billion for the lines.=
=20
PG&E and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills=
=20
and become credit-worthy once more.
?????But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogge=
d=20
down. Meanwhile, support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be=20
slipping. Republicans have long been opposed, but now support among Democra=
ts=20
is waning.
?????Keeley, a critic of the transmission purchase all along, believes that=
=20
the state should instead buy the utilities' hydro-electric generators,=20
contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the=
=20
dams.
?????"We're just going to sink dough into that [transmission system]," Keel=
ey=20
said, adding that the grid needs an estimated $1 billion in repairs. The=20
hydro system, by contrast, would be a revenue-producing asset that could he=
lp=20
lower rates, he said.
?????A related question--still unresolved--is the fate of the state's nearl=
y=20
700 producers of alternative and renewable energy, which supply more than a=
=20
quarter of the electricity used by California consumers. In a separate acti=
on=20
Tuesday, the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producers--whose=20
megawatts are desperately needed and who, in many instances, have not been=
=20
paid since November.
?????On Tuesday, the small producers delivered a little more than half of=
=20
their usual supplies to the utilities--a trend that has dragged on for=20
several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts.
?????Producers welcomed the PUC's order that they start getting paid. But,=
=20
they said, the move failed to address back payments, estimated at $1.5=20
billion, owed by Edison and PG&E.
?????"Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Thir=
d=20
World countries than they do in the state of California," griped Marty Quin=
n,=20
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC=
,=20
which owns three small gas-fired generators.
?????Any move to resolve that issue, of course, would increase the debt owe=
d=20
by the utilities.
?????On another front, state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal=
=20
long-term electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the=
=20
volatile spot market.
?????So far, only 22 contracts have been signed, in part because generators=
=20
are reluctant to commit to lower prices while they're still owed billions o=
f=20
dollars by the near-bankrupt utilities. Experts say the power secured by th=
e=20
current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need th=
is=20
summer.
?????Despite all the unsettled questions, at least one utility analyst, Dan=
=20
Ford of the Lehman Bros. investment firm, said the PUC's actions should=20
remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the=20
"California cloud" over electricity generators.
?????But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall=

Street, Standard & Poor's said it would continue to carry a cautionary cred=

?????The rating agency, which placed California on a "credit watch" after t=

NEWS ANALYSIS
Davis Keeps His Distance From Utility Rate Hikes=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis, convinced that he can't win votes by=20

y=20
all experts have been saying for months--that electricity bills are going u=

?????Indeed, on Tuesday, the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance=

it an "energy challenge," not a crisis, even as the state's two largest=20
utilities border on bankruptcy, and the state experienced blackouts a week=

Clara), "you can't possibly improve it. His posture has been baffling. I=20
lament what is going on. This is my beloved state, and we're in serious=20
peril, and it scares me."
?????Many academics, utility executives, Wall Street analysts and legislato=
rs=20
concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary, given the=20
soaring wholesale price of electricity. Even Davis has acknowledged that a=
=20
rate hike might solve the situation.
?????"Believe me," Davis said Feb. 16, "if I wanted to raise rates, I could=
=20
have solved this problem in 20 minutes."
?????But in a reaction that added to lawmakers' bewilderment, Davis said in=
 a=20
statement Tuesday that the PUC action was "premature because we do not have=
=20
all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision."
?????"Until we do," the statement continued, "I cannot support any rate=20
increase."
?????In taking steps to raise rates, Lynch may well end up taking substanti=
al=20
flak for her governor.
?????"Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state," Sragow=20
said. "Gray Davis is still popular. Voters clearly don't see a connection=
=20
between the governor and the PUC."
?????Davis' aides say the governor didn't talk to Lynch before she acted.=
=20
Lynch, a frequent visitor to the Capitol, was in Sacramento late last week=
=20
and again Tuesday. She may not have spoken to Davis, but she did make other=
=20
top administration officials aware of her plans.
?????Lynch could have decided to act on her own. The state Constitution giv=
es=20
the commission authority to raise utility rates. But the governor is well=
=20
known as a micro-manager, involved in the most minute details of state=20
governance. Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to "thi=
nk=20
like I think," and not to act on their own.
?????As recently as last week, Davis directed that the PUC take specific=20
actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid.
?????Davis has said the Legislature's job is to implement his vision. He ha=
s=20
said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should=20
resign. His appointees "should not be free agents."
?????So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch wou=
ld=20
move to raise rates Tuesday, particularly given events that occurred late=
=20
last week.
?????On Friday, Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy, one of h=
is=20
top aides, met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors. At the meeting, a=
=20
participant warned that rates might have to rise 50% to 100%.
?????Also Friday, a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis' staff was=
=20
convinced that a rate hike was necessary, even as Davis continued to public=
ly=20
oppose it. On Sunday, a top Davis aide referred reporters to Lynch, who=20
confirmed that she would move to raise rates Tuesday.
?????Two months ago, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union was defending Davis.=
=20
Now, Snyder, who has worked with Davis on various issues for decades, is,=
=20
like many others, raising questions about the governor's credibility, his=
=20
penchant for secrecy and his competence.
?????"Something is wrong," Snyder said. "Either he is over his depth, or it=
=20
is hubris, or it is the great river in Egypt, 'Denial.' "
?????Here are some of the governor's statements and actions, since called=
=20
into question:
?????* Davis held a news conference Feb. 23 to say he had reached an=20
agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a=
=20
deal to buy its massive transmission system for $2.76 billion. A final=20
package, he said, would be announced within a week, not only with Edison bu=
t=20
with San Diego Gas and Electric.
?????A month later, a top utility executive described the talks as=20
"dreadfully slow." Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas &=20
Electric, which he said back in February would be completed by now, are eve=
n=20
further behind.
?????* Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with=
=20
independent generators to buy power. He said, however, that the contracts=
=20
accounted for 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts of electricity this summer, a=20
significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy muc=
h=20
of its power on the far more costly spot market.
?????Last week, when he released some scant details in a report on the=20
contracts, experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to=
=20
buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market.
?????* Davis brushed aside reporters' questions last week about the blackou=
ts=20
that rolled across the state. He remained cloistered as the outages continu=
ed=20
for a second day, emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensu=
re=20
that alternative energy producers would be paid. A week after he called on=
=20
lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid, the=20
legislation remains stalled.
?????"It is inept at all levels and doesn't encourage any confidence that h=
e=20
can handle it," Snyder said. "Moreover, it doesn't encourage us that he is=
=20
going to tell the truth."
?????The energy crisis is perilous for Davis' reelection effort next year.=
=20
But the governor's strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to=
=20
great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes, could be to his=20
benefit when he faces voters.
?????"Ethically," said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain, "not bei=
ng=20
forthcoming is worse. Politically, the more he can obfuscate, the more like=
ly=20
it is some people will buy the obfuscation. . . . The reason we see=20
obfuscation is that obfuscation works."
?????Not all politicians follow that maxim.
?????Davis' predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, held a news conferenc=
e=20
in 1991, as California plunged into a recession, to announce that he was=20
pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history, calling =
it=20
necessary to help erase a $14-billion deficit. Top advisors had urged him t=
o=20
leave the delivery of such bad news to others.
?????"Any time you deliver bad news to voters you're taking a risk," said D=
an=20
Schnur, who was Wilson's spokesman. "But it is a much bigger risk to allow =

Federal Energy Agency Unlikely to Order Refunds=20

Power: Regulatory panel says much of the overcharge alleged by Cal-ISO is=
=20
beyond its jurisdiction, and questions whether the rest is "excessive."=20

By MEGAN GARVEY and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers=20

?????WASHINGTON--What are the chances that federal regulators will order=20
electricity wholesalers to refund $6.3 billion in alleged overcharges?
?????Zero.
?????Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have=20
already made clear that nearly $3 billion--almost half the total that=20
California's grid operator said last week was excessive--is off the table=
=20
because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place=
=20
before Oct. 2 beyond their reach.=20
?????As for the rest, lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observe=
rs=20
note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority t=
o=20
enforce "fair and reasonable" rates because of difficulty in defining that=
=20
phrase. Some within FERC question how much of the "excessive" rates=20
documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERC's=
=20
jurisdiction--for example, rates charged by municipal power suppliers that=
=20
are not regulated by the federal agency.
?????So far, FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund=
=20
only $124 million in alleged overcharges--just 5% of the amount that the=20
Cal-ISO has identified. That sum deals only with rates charged in January a=
nd=20
February 2001 during Stage 3 alerts--periods when electricity reserves fall=
=20
below 1.5%.
?????FERC's approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably no=
t=20
become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon=
=20
have. President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill=20
vacancies on the five-member commission, the White House announced Tuesday.
?????The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III, chairman of the Texas=20
Utility Commission and a Bush ally, and Nora Mead Brownell, a member of the=
=20
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, to the FERC governing board.
?????Administration officials have indicated that Wood, 38, would assume th=
e=20
FERC chairmanship, a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr., a staunch advoca=
te=20
of energy deregulation.

?????Shake-Up at FERC Was Expected
?????The shake-up has been expected because of continuing complaints that=
=20
FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and=
=20
electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West. Hebert in=20
particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price=20
controls on wholesale electricity sales.
?????Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California'=
s=20
plight, replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Sena=
te=20
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
?????Cal-ISO officials--who pointed out that their $6.3-billion figure was=
=20
part of a study calling for stronger market controls, not for refunds--may=
=20
still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and Februar=
y.=20
FERC ordered wholesalers to justify $124 million worth of charges shortly=
=20
after Cal-ISO asked for $550 million in refunds for December and January.
?????FERC's refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulato=
rs=20
who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of=20
supply and demand. At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to=
=20
date in California as well as future rates.
?????And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing=20
skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophie=
s=20
of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it. What role=20
should the government--specifically FERC, an agency with a mandate to ensur=
e=20
"fair and reasonable" rates--play?
?????"The whole notion that there's such a thing as a just price is kind of=
=20
an anachronism from New Deal days," said Pietro Nivola, a Brookings Institu=
te=20
scholar who studies regulatory politics. "Especially as we move closer to=
=20
some form of deregulation, we've come to understand that the price is what=
=20
the traffic will bear. In this case, utilities simply have to be able to ge=
t=20
higher rates at the retail end."
?????But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority, allowing the=
=20
wholesalers to operate with impunity.
?????"The message FERC has sent so far is, as long as you leave 10 cents of=
=20
every dollar in the bank we won't pull the alarm," said Mark Cooper, direct=
or=20
of research for the Consumer Federation of America.
?????Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERC--while highly=
=20
unlikely--would go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices. But FERC=
=20
officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm=
=20
than good, potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market=20
already too tight. The memory of the 1970s oil crisis and a prevalent view=
=20
among economists that government intervention made matters worse has inform=
ed=20
the views of some longtime government officials and observers.

?????Refunds Called 'Inferior Remedy'
?????A clear sign of FERC's reluctance to call for refunds came late last=
=20
year, when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for t=
he=20
California price increases. FERC officials said at the time, "Refunds may b=
e=20
an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental soluti=
on=20
to any problems occurring in California markets."
?????The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Sta=
ge=20
3 alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month =
by=20
some lawmakers and utility company officials. They complained that the narr=
ow=20
focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers=20
believed were outrageous.
?????But even the $124 million questioned by FERC has been defended by the=
=20
wholesale companies. In briefs filed with the agency last week, they said=
=20
rates exceeding $430 per megawatt-hour--compared with a pre-crisis average =
of=20
$30 per megawatt-hour--were justified by the increased credit risk=20
wholesalers took in selling to near-bankrupt utilities that have billions o=
f=20
dollars in outstanding debts.
?????Duke Energy, which FERC has said overcharged California by $20 million=
,=20
signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing.=20
?????"We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these=
=20
months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price," company president Ji=
m=20
Donnell said this week. "If we are not assured payment, the credit premiums=
=20
are obviously appropriate, and we would reserve our right to collect the=20
entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order."
?????Both of Bush's Republican nominees to the commission are expected to w=
in=20
Senate confirmation. But they can expect a grilling from Sen. Dianne=20
Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has accused power suppliers of price-gouging and=
=20
FERC of doing little to stop it.=20
?????"Certainly, my vote would be dependent on whether they're going to be=
=20
responsive to the present situation," Feinstein said Tuesday, grousing that=
=20
the administration has been "recalcitrant to the point of arrogance."
?????Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney, head of a White=
=20
House energy task force, but she described the meeting as "disappointing."=
=20
Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the=20
California crisis, and adding a hand-written note: "The West needs your hel=
p."
?????A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners=20
would have a "more sympathetic ear" for the concerns of the Western states.
?????But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to=
=20
price controls. "Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s,=
=20
and the United States will not repeat the mistake again," he said in a spee=
ch=20
in Kalamazoo, Mich.
?????The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn. The grou=
p=20
expressed confidence that they would be "strong proponents of completing th=
e=20
much-needed transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all=
=20
across the country."
?????Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment. Wood said in a=

A Painful Step=20
Electricity rate increase may help, but Gov. Davis is yet to offer an=20
understandable plan to end the crisis.=20

?????By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users, the state Publi=

electricity market in California, even if Gov. Gray Davis has not.=20
Electricity costs more these days, even aside from the piratical rates=20
charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency.=20
?????The increase, while probably necessary, will not by itself solve the=
=20
crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer. The two biggest private=20
utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, still are=
=20
saddled with as much as $13 billion in debt for past power purchases. State=
=20
government still is shelling out some $50 million in daily power purchases=
=20
and has committed as much as $40 billion to future power contracts. Davis=
=20
continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities' share of the state powe=
r=20
transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities' debts.=
=20
?????Despite all the hand-wringing and arm-waving, nothing that state=20
government has done since January has provided any significant new power=20
generation or conservation. Consumers are right to wonder what happened to =
a=20
promised statewide conservation campaign. After first ducking the power=20
problem, Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year, most of=
=20
them still works in progress. But he still has not given the people an=20
understandable, coherent plan for getting out of this fix. Worse, he refuse=
s=20
even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges=20
Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future.=20
?????The irony of Tuesday's rate increase is that the state might have dodg=
ed=20
much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago. But Davis, seekin=

reelection next year, insisted that the crisis be solved "within the existi=

?????The rate increase, which will be drafted over the next 30 days, affect=
s=20
customers of Edison and PG&E but not residents of Los Angeles or other citi=
es=20
with full municipal power systems. The stated intent is that bigger users,=

major amounts of power during the summer. Under one scenario, nearly half o=

households--low and medium users--would pay no more than they do now. The=
=20
boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the state's daily power=

purchases, although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet=

relief if lawsuits against power generators' exorbitant pricing are=20

from the governor, including his dodging of the rate issue.=20
?????However, most state experts, including Davis' own utilities=20

"This rate increase is long overdue," said Richard Bilas, who also sits on=

"This is being shoved down the people's throats," said Dorothy Diez, an=20

Davis' staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its=20
decision.=20
'DAVIS CONTROLS PUC'=20
"Gov. Davis controls the PUC," said Doug Heller, assistant organizing=20

PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the=20

"The PUC has done all it can," said Lynch, the PUC president. "We have foug=

"We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on," Lynch said.=20
Along the same lines, the PUC approved a requirement that PG&E and Edison=
=20
repay the state Department of Water Resources for about $4 billion in power=

purchases made on the cash-strapped utilities' behalf.=20
The commission also passed a motion forcing PG&E and Edison to pay smaller=

However, the PUC simultaneously ordered the nearly bankrupt utilities to pa=

No explanation given after officials approve 27 percent rate hike=20
Posted at 10:00 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 27, 2001=20
BY STEVE JOHNSON=20

Mercury News=20


After months of waiting for the state's elected leaders to act, California'=
s=20
Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest=20
electricity rate increase in at least two decades, and offered no assurance=
s=20
that more hikes won't be needed soon.=20
The 3-cent per kilowatt-hour increase would boost average rates for all=20
customers by 27 percent, although the precise residential and business rate=
s=20
have yet to be determined. It is effective immediately and will show up on=
=20
bills in May.=20
The commission's vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political=
=20
backdrop: Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed three of its five members, said he=
=20
wasn't consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it.=
=20
But Davis, after learning Sunday night about the plan, apparently did not=
=20
seek to block the commission's action. Instead, he issued a statement=20
immediately after the vote that called it ``premature because we do not hav=
e=20
all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision. Until w=
e=20
do, I cannot support any rate increase.''=20
The commission, however, said it had no alternative but to raise rates,=20
considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billion=
s=20
in taxpayer funds on power because its cash-strapped utilities are no longe=
r=20
credit-worthy.=20
But even some commissioners were uneasy. Davis' most recent appointee on th=
e=20
commission, Geoffrey Brown, acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that ``=
we=20
as commissioners had very little time to review this.''=20
In fact, an administrative law judge -- using much the same evidence that w=
as=20
included in the decision to raise rates -- had concluded recently that no=
=20
such increase was justified.=20
The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of 3 cents pe=
r=20
kilowatt-hour. Previously, officials with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and=20
Southern California Edison had only sought a 2-cent per kilowatt-hour=20
increase.=20
Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain=
=20
whether a 3-cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormou=
s=20
cost the state has incurred since it began buying power.=20
The state still doesn't know how much its effort to bail out PG&E and Ediso=
n=20
-- which involves a state purchase of the utilities' high-voltage lines --=
=20
will cost. It's also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on t=
he=20
expensive electricity spot market this summer, and whether an additional ra=
te=20
increase would be needed to cover that.=20
``Have we got the number right?'' asked Commissioner Henry Duque, in=20
reference to the 3-cent increase. ``I don't know. But I hope we have.''=20
Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the Assembly Utilities Committee=
,=20
told the commission that he opposed the idea of approving any rate hike now=
,=20
until the state has a better idea of the total amount that consumers=20
ultimately will have to bear.=20
By establishing a 3-cent increase now, ``we'll be back in a short time,=20
potentially doing it again,'' he said. ``To be nickeled and dimed to death =
as=20
we're doing here, I don't think that does anybody any good.''=20
Signs of confusion=20
Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused.=20
``While providing a welcome dose of realism,'' PG&E president Gordon Smith=
=20
said in a prepared statement, the rate hike and other actions taken by the=
=20
commission Tuesday ``do not offer a comprehensive solution, fail to resolve=
=20
the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability.''=20
Among PG&E's major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated fo=
r=20
their debts -- which they claim total about $13 billion -- and whether PG&E=
=20
or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spo=
t=20
market.=20
Bruce Foster, an Edison vice president, offered a similar lukewarm=20
endorsement of the increase. ``I'm not saying that it will do it,'' he said=
,=20
acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road, but he calle=
d=20
the hike ``a step in the right direction.''=20
Rate hike vs. bankruptcy=20
Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced=
=20
into bankruptcy, the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger=
=20
rate hikes to stabilize the companies' finances.=20
``A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one design=
ed=20
by a bankruptcy judge,'' Bilas said, adding that he also was concerned abou=
t=20
how the state appeared to be buying electricity ``like a drunken sailor.''=
=20
But others reacted angrily to the commission's decision. Several protesters=
=20
hoisted signs at the meeting that read, ``we won't pay'' and chanted, ``rat=
e=20
hikes go away, make the energy companies pay.'' Police later escorted them=
=20
out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed =
at=20
their noisy interruptions.=20
Instead of raising rates, they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to=
=20
use the state's power of eminent domain to take over the power plants=20
operated by companies accused of gouging the public.=20
``The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing=
=20
by the rules of society,'' said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utili=
ty=20
Reform Network in San Francisco. ``They're economic war criminals.''=20
Officials in Davis' office said Tuesday that they intend to review the=20
commission's action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support i=
t=20
or seek changes. But to some people, the governor's claim of ignorance abou=
t=20
the commission's plan -- and his seeming inability to do anything to stop t=
he=20
rate hike from being approved -- severely strained credulity.=20
``Give me a break,'' said Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose. ``Who appoint=
ed=20
them and who's been giving orders all along?''=20
Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consid=
er=20
having consumers pay more for electricity. ``If it becomes clear that a rat=
e=20
increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state,'' he said, ``I=
=20
will support one that is fair.''=20

ways: The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most, and=20
nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all.=20
Although the details aren't yet final, state regulators say they intend to=
=20
fashion a ``tiered structure'' to implement the higher rates. Here's how th=
e=20
proposal will affect your bill:=20
When do the higher rates kick in?=20
Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it won't=20
appear on bills until May. While regulators agreed that rates will rise, th=
ey=20
still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost.=20
Hearings are expected next month. Once the structure is approved, regulator=
s=20
say, utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesday's rate approval.=20
Do the new rates affect all Californians?=20
No. The Public Utilities Commission, which approved the rate increase, has=
=20
authority over only investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,=
=20
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, which together ser=
ve=20
about 10 million homes and businesses. The increase affects PG&E and Edison=
,=20
but not San Diego. Municipal utilities, including Santa Clara, Palo Alto,=
=20
Alameda, Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt.=
=20
How will the new rates work?=20
Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial a=
nd=20
power-guzzling residential customers pay a greater share. Residential=20
customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their ``baseline=
''=20
amount.=20
What is the baseline?=20
The baseline is considered the average household usage. It was established=
=20
years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electrici=
ty=20
usage over that amount.=20
Does everybody have the same baseline?=20
No. Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in=
=20
electricity needs caused by regional climate, household type and season.=20
How many baselines are there?=20
PG&E residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among=
=20
three climatic baseline territories: the coastal areas including San=20
Francisco and the Peninsula, the East Bay and South Bay, and the Santa Cruz=
=20
Mountains.=20
Within those territories, there are separate baselines for single-family=20
homes and multifamily apartment complexes, as well as for homes with only=
=20
electric appliances instead of both gas and electric.=20
In addition, baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage. Summe=
r=20
rates begin May 1, and winter rates begin Nov. 1.=20
How do I find out my baseline?=20
Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatt-hours and the rate=
=20
you are billed for that amount. It also shows how much power you used over=
=20
the baseline and the rate you were billed for it.=20
How does the baseline affect my bill?=20
Customers already pay about 14 percent more for power they use over their=
=20
baseline. Under the proposed tiered rates, PG&E customers who use no more=
=20
than 130 percent of their baseline amount wouldn't pay any more than they d=
o=20
now. PG&E customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average=
 9=20
percent increase in monthly bills. Those who use more than twice their=20
baseline would see an average increase of 36 percent. Edison customers woul=
d=20
have similar rates. Almost half of the utilities' customers don't exceed 13=
0=20
percent of their baseline.=20
Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase?=20
The increase can be calculated many ways. The commission approved an increa=
se=20
of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, three times the 1-cent surcharge approved in=20
January, which was made permanent Tuesday. Because the 1-cent increase=20
averaged 10 percent, some have said that, plus the 3 cents, amounts to a=20
40-percent increase.=20
Others have added 3 cents to the amount the utilities charge just for=20
electricity, which for PG&E is now 6.4 cents, and come up with a 47-percent=
=20
increase.=20
Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges, others=
=20
have added 3 cents to the average total rate of 11.14 cents for all=20
customers, a 27-percent increase. Under the tiered proposal, the average=20
residential rate would rise 20.8 percent from 12.46 cents to 15.05 cents.=
=20
But average bills for residents' bills would increase up to 36 percent,=20
depending on electricity use.=20
Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy?=20
The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesn't apply =
to=20
commercial and industrial businesses. In fact, the proposal calls for a=20
proportionately greater increase for businesses, which pay lower rates than=
=20
residential customers. Commercial customers would see a 22.6-percent=20
increase. Industrial customers, generally over 500 kilowatt-hours a month,=
=20
would see a 41-percent increase.=20
But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power. Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis this month ordered 20-percent rebates for all customers who redu=
ce=20
electricity usage 20 percent over last year between June and September.=20
Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on 20 percent=20
reduction of total consumption, while commercial and industrial rebates wil=
l=20
be based on 20 percent reduction of peak load.=20
If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now, will I have to pay more=
?=20
Possibly. The proposal calls for exempting customers in the California=20
Alternative Rates for Energy program, and expanding eligibility from 150=20
percent to 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines. But commissioners=20
aren't ruling out tiered rates for those customers to encourage them to sav=

State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered=20
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to start paying=20
alternative-energy producers $79 per megawatt-hour. But alternative=20

Alternative generators have been paid little, or nothing, the past four=20
months and are now collectively owed more than $1 billion by the utilities.=

The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or sh=

Davis backs power rate hikes if 'necessary'=20
He says PUC approval of hikes Tuesday is 'premature.' S&P is unsure how=20
conservation will affect revenue.=20
March 28, 2001=20
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register=20
SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate=
=20
hikes, saying he would support them "if it becomes clear it is absolutely=
=20
necessary for the good of the state."=20
The governor's statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities=
=20
Commission, a panel controlled by Davis' appointees, endorsed a plan to rai=
se=20
monthly bills by as much 36 percent. The increase eventually would be tied =
to=20
a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more, medium=
=20
users (those who conserve energy) will pay moderately more, and heavy users=
=20
will pay a lot more. Details of the plan are not yet set.=20
Davis called the PUC's decision "premature," saying scant information was=
=20
available to justify increases.=20
"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear a rate increase i=
s=20
absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support one that is=
=20
fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity," Davis said.=
=20
Boosting electricity rates to help resolve California's energy crisis is=20
likely to increase the state's $10 billion revenue bond sale to $12 billion=
=20
or more, entailing more interest charges and a longer payback.=20
Standard and Poor's, the Wall Street credit-rating agency, called the ratin=
g=20
plan "a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of=
=20
electricity."=20
"It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected, and whether revenue=
s=20
will slip under the rate-raising formula as consumers respond by conserving=
=20
electricity," S&P said.=20
Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided. The=20
state, which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities, says it has=
=20
first rights to the money. The utilities have challenged that.=20
California hopes to borrow $10 billion by selling revenue bonds in May to=
=20
cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December. Through=
=20
April 7, those costs are expected to total $4.2 billion.=20
The bond money also will be used to pay for power under long-term contracts=
,=20
which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used.=20
Critics have questioned whether $10 billion will be sufficient. PUC Preside=
nt=20
Loretta Lynch said the increased rates would support at least a $12 billion=
=20
bond sale. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio and Joseph Fichera, a Davis fisca=

Cheney insisted, Feinstein said, that California has to "straighten itself=

is roughly 48 percent in winter months and 45 percent in the summer.=20
Because baseline is set based on the average household's use, it means a=20
single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a=20
homeowner with four children.=20
Baseline varies depending on where you live. Warmer areas get higher=20
baselines. There are different baselines for the summer and winter. People=

who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocation=
s.=20
All-electric homes get higher baselines.=20
Q: What's the reason for this rate hike? Are they really doing this to get=
=20
people to conserve?=20
A: Conservation is a side benefit. The primary motivation is money.=20
The state has already shelled out $3 billion buying power in the last three=
=20
months for customers of the near-insolvent utilities.=20
The state plans to issue bonds, which will be paid for by consumers, to cov=

revenue stream - a rate increase - to convince them the bonds can be repaid=
.=20
However, people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their=

power, so the plan will also help reduce demand.=20
Q: I'm already conserving. How can I cut my bill further?=20
A: It's nitty-gritty time. Replace your incandescent light bulbs with=20

computer, coffeepot, toaster and blow dryer.=20
Q. When will I pay the increase?=20

SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 -- California's power regulators approved the large=
st=20
utility rate increases in state history today in an effort to avert more=20
rolling blackouts and keep the state's principal electricity producers from=
=20
collapsing in bankruptcy.=20
Despite Gov. Gray Davis's repeated statements that no new rate increases=20
would be needed to keep the state's two largest utilities solvent, the Stat=
e=20
Public Utilities Commission said today that it had no choice but to raise=
=20
rates by up to 46 percent for customers of the two utilities to avoid a=20
greater catastrophe if the companies went bankrupt.=20
''We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust=20
energy prices,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission president and a Davis=
=20
appointee, who had proposed the increases on Monday.=20
Ms. Lynch said that under a tiered rate system that would be hammered out=
=20
within the next 30 days, heavy power users would face the greatest increase=
s=20
while light users would face little or no increases. Customers will see the=
=20
rate increases in their May utility bills.=20
Perhaps 45 percent of consumers under this system -- including the poorest=
=20
residents, who would be exempt -- will face no increase at all, Ms. Lynch=
=20
said. Heavy users will face increases of about 36 percent, she said.=20
Coupled with the average 10 percent temporary rate increase in January that=
=20
the commission made permanent today, those consumers will pay 46 percent mo=
re=20
for utilities than they did in December.=20
But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates=
=20
increase could feel the impact if commercial power customers, from small=20
businesses to megastores, pass on their higher electricity costs through=20
price increases.=20
Before the rate increases, power costs in California were slightly higher=
=20
than the national average, but lower than the prices paid in New York and=
=20
other Northeastern States. Residential electricity users already pay an=20
average of about $65 a month, state officials say. In addition, under a=20
previous commission decision, rates will go up an additional 10 percent nex=
t=20
year.=20
The commission, which approved the rate increase 5 to 0, also voted to=20
require that the two large utilities, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company=
=20
and Southern California Edison, reimburse the state's Department of Water=
=20
Resources $4 billion spent on their behalf and begin paying alternative=20
energy generators, which account for more than a quarter of the state's dai=

energy needs. The two utilities have not paid their bills for months, sayin=

they are nearly bankrupt because under deregulation of the power industry,=

The Department of Water Resources has spent $45 million a day since January=

=20
week, the state's power managers were forced to order rolling blackouts=20
across parts of the state, in part because the small energy producers shut=

down half their capacity because they had not been paid.=20
The rate increases will make the payoff more feasible, Ms. Lynch said, whil=

encouraging energy conservation. But a representative of the state's=20
alternative-energy generators, known as qualifying facilities, complained=
=20
that the commission did nothing to address the roughly $1.5 billion the=20

''I'm not sure what our options are at this point if the state wants the=20
qualified facilities to be a part of the solution,'' said David Fogarty, a=

spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association and alternative-ener=
gy=20
co-generators, representing about 50 alternative-energy producers in=20
California.=20
For those on all sides, the commission seemed to raise as many questions as=
=20
it answered. Consumer advocates, who interrupted the hearing five times,=20
questioned why the commission had decided on the vote so abruptly, with onl=
y=20
24-hour notice to the public. Spokesmen for each of the utility companies=
=20
said they had no idea what the rate increases would mean to the average=20
customer until the tiered system was determined. They also said they did no=
t=20
know whether these new rates would mean the end of rolling blackouts.=20
''They may know something that I don't know,'' said Bruce Foster, vice=20
president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison, speaking of=
=20
the commission's vote outside the hearing room.=20
Mr. Foster also complained that the commission's directive to begin paying=
=20
bills to the state and the alternative energy producers -- or face a penalt=
y=20
equal to the amount owed -- might be illegal and said that the company woul=
d=20
look into appealing it.=20
Ron Low, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, also complained that the=
=20
commission's actions seemed rushed and lacked specifics.=20
The rate increase will generate about $2.5 billion a year for Pacific Gas a=
nd=20
Electric, unit of PG&E and $2.3 billion for Southern California Edison, a=
=20
unit of Edison International. While those revenues will help the utilities=
=20
buy power on the wholesale market in the future, the commission made no=20
provision for paying off about $13 billion in debt accumulated by the=20
utilities as a result of past wholesale costs. That issue would be left to=
=20
the governor and state legislators.=20
The commission heard public comment before the vote, but did not answer=20
questions afterward. Consumer advocates were furious, many blaming Governor=
=20
Davis.=20
The governor today issued a statement calling the commission's move=20
premature. ''From the beginning, I've said that my main goal was to solve=

Mr. Davis's statement seemed to reflect the awareness he and his aides feel=

Subject: APS Answer/Interconnection Filing


Christi,

Attached are comments Gretchen generated regarding APS' answer to our joint
protest of APS' interconnection procedures.  We are considering filing a
reply, and I wanted to get your input.  Generally, DENA does not like to
file answers to answers as it is in FERC's discretion whether to accept
such responses, but we may want to consider clarifying our position
regarding the monthly direct assignment charges under Article 12 of the IA.
Please let me know your take.

Best Regards,

Teresa Brown
(713) 627-6592

We've taken a look at the answer Arizona Public Service Company filed on
12/22/00 in response to our protest.  There are a number of issues to which
DENA should consider responding.  Responses must be filed by Monday,
January
8, 2001.

*    Study assumptions (APS Answer, at 8-9):  APS argues that there is no
benefit from disclosing assumptions and that this would give a generator an
unfair market advantage over other market participants.  While APS does not
indicate to whom there is no benefit, presumably it means APS.  We should
consider challenging this since there is a benefit to disclosure of the
study assumptions -- how else is a generator to determine whether it is
being asked to goldplate APS' system?  APS' answer to this is to say that
the IA's Willful Action provisions prevent APS from conducting activities
or
making decisions based on motive to serve financial benefit.  We are at a
loss, however, as to how the provisions accomplish that since what they
really do is shield APS from liability.I agree -- and agree that APS' response
doesn't make sense.  I believe that the Commission has
required Entergy to provide more study data to a generator in one of last 
year's
complaints against Entergy (either Dynegy or NRG?).

**What about a response on the "must -run" issue (p. 27-28).  I think APS is 
trying to 
back door the Arizona proposed requirements (that are still being fought and 
are
not accepted?)  This is a big issue and APS' response does not address our 
arguments other
than stating that Must Run should be required in the IA.  I do not
know of any other interconnection agreements that have must-run provisions.
*    Transmission credits (APS Answer, at 30-31):  APS claims that
transmission credits are appropriate only for firm service, a proposition
the Commission just rejected in the ComEd order issued on 12/8/00.Absolutely 
agree that it
should be for firm and non-firm.
*    Monthly Direct Assignment Charges (APS Answer, at 32-33):  We should
consider clarifying our position on this issue, which APS appears to
misunderstand. APS argues that, in our protest, we addressed the cost of
modifications, not the cost of operation and maintenance, and thus were
comparing apples to oranges.  This is not true.  Rather, what we argued is
that we should not be responsible for the cost of operating and maintaining
any facilities for which we were not responsible for the initial
installation cost.  APS apparently missed the point.I agree.
*    Willful Action (APS Answer, at 33-37):  APS essentially argues that
the strict liability provisions in the IA are appropriate because it cannot
make a profit by entering into an IA.  Unlike with respect to transmission
service, it recovers only its actual costs.  APS  ignores the fact that, by
interconnecting a generator, APS will ultimately generate transmission
revenue.  APS also ignores the benefits that new generation bring to the
table.   APS has not justified why the liability provisions are "consistent
with, or superior to" the pro forma tariff and why a generator should be
required to bear the consequences of APS' negligence and, in many
instances,
intentional misconduct, particularly where APS is not provided any
incentive
to act prudently, simply because APS receives no profit.I agree.  APS' 
proposed restrictions
are wholly unwarranted and are outrageous.  There are no other 
interconnection agreements
(that I know of) containing anything remotely similar.

Please let us know how you'd like to proceed.  If you have any questions,
let us know.  Thanks.

Gretchen

Subject: RE: Questions you requested



 This excellent material, and very important, but it's pretty
esoteric.  If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins, use
Mary's stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB.   Assuming
it's true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission
route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power, and that this raised the
market price in the NW by about $50-75 per megawatt-hour, and that this is
costing the NW $2-5 million per day (at least for the period that Mary
looked at), that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit.  If we can
establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Davis's handpicked
ISO board, the NW Senators will escape Earth's gravitational pull.  For that
very reason, we have to be able to back up anything we say, and we need to
anticipate any defenses the ISO may have.  But if you want NW elected
officials to quit being so polite toward Davis, that will do it.

Subject: Questions you requested


Joshua:

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC
so believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional
materials, just let me know.
(See attached file: Ron Wyden Qs for Steve Kean.doc)


In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing
with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder"
management board was created that represented a wide range of market
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the
California Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger
western regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs
are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power
crunch comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during
times of real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to
shoot first and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions
involving out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial
interests sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of
robust, competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions
practically guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

The ISO is now saying that it has the authority to require EPMI to report our 
prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market Monitoring 
Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad 
authority to request information, specifically: "the submission of any 
infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be 
potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose 
activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."  

Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not order 
us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it.  
I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO 
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have asked Sue Mara if she would 
contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please 
advise if this is the proper course of action.  Please note, the information 
is due tomorrow.

If we haven't sold anything over the cap, then I would go with #3:  Report 
that we haven't and that we shan't report until we do.

>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 02/28/01 07:03PM >>>
By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting
the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO
transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded
that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing
rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be
quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding
that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has
correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.

The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement
actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above
the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could
do one of several things for you at this point:
   Stay quiet
   Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)
   Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and
   will not report unless and until we do
   Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back
   Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA

I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the
"Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm
inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please
verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

Joe Attached find the report you requested.  Alan - Governor Davis offered a 
highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement 
conference today.  As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or 
without FERC requiring it.  Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your 
assistance with this settlement negotiation.

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday 
(Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU 
forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX 
participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two 
possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking 
provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to 
hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are 
wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent 
domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second 
idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.

Mary,

Best of luck in your new responsibilities.  If you hear of any
opportunities for an economist at NE-ISO, please let me know.  I'm
always interested in what might "lie beyond" (but not "beneath").

Actually, I recently responded to an ad at NE-ISO for an economist to
study market structures, but never heard back from them.  Marcia and
I have family or good friends in NY, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and occasionally think that we should
move back, notwithstanding the winters  . . .  and the summers!

or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information

Gary,

Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice 
which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning.

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX 
failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there.  
Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of 
it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice 
being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be 
what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good luck today! - MO

On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor 
Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional 
transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a 
transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power 
Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It 
also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring 
the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale 
sales to date.

Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to 
cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts 
until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has 
proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts 
back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend 
its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks 
the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.

I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of 
the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission 
ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and 
(2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed 
in the auction.  

Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about 
it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its 
retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?

What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero?

It was derated by 3200 MW, raising Mid-Columbia prices by $50-75/MWh.  It's 
not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on 
different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the 
California Oregon border North.

 I like the idea alot, and I'll call you later this morning.  In the
meantime, do we have any idea how much power is being kept in CA by the
transmission derating?    How much is it affecting the market price in the
NW?  Is it also affecting CA's ability to return power to BPA pursuant to
the one-for-two exchange agreement?  I know these are probably tough
questions to answer, but the staff of NW members will want our best
estimate.

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?)
to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even
get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more
difficult for him to balance his budget.

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply
trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also
point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of
Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency
and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have
a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the
power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power
transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

FERC Won't Reconsider PG&E Reorg. Plan
By Patrick Connole

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday 
upheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its 
unregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by 
California state officials and by other companies.

The utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a 
way to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to 
bankruptcy by the California power crisis.

PG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest 
utilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale 
prices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the 
companies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.

On Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to-1 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny 
requests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.

FERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than 
$20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in 
the energy-starved state.

PG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated 
companies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger 
Generating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma 
Generating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek 
Generating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, 
Pittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.

``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E 
Corp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order. 
``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit 
rating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the 
subsidiaries.''

FERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the 
corporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.

``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the 
possibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from 
selling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in 
California,'' the FERC order said.

The majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.

``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit 
ratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will 
finance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the 
order said.

FERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate 
reorganization.

Commissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled 
by FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously 
objected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate 
reorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.

The NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.

California lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide 
immediate and long-term relief to both utilities.

FERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate 
electricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently 
vacant.

AReM Team:

Here is report from Hertzberg news conference:

Democratic Caucus announced a package of bills to increase the supply of
electricity and cut down on demand through energy efficiency.

The package being introduced will produce more than 750 megawatts and save
1,200 megawatts over the next few years. 

Said the energy efficiency package may save as many as 500 megawatts,
equivalent to a new power plant. 

Demos presented a four bill package aimed at rapidly increasing and
stabilizing the supply of power available to the demands of residents and
businesses. The bills would:

Provide $50 million to establish an incentive program to encourage business
to install clean and modern on-site generation.

		 Subject: PGE RFP

Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI 
wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 
50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's 
system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and PGE 
has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  

I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the 
terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that EPMI 
could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory 
risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's 
favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you tell me how much you 
would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,  in the event PGE accepts 
our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing.  Is that 
okay?

That's really nice of you Mary.  I'd like to return the favor some time.  I'm
having a medical procedure Friday afternoon that I'd just as soon not describe
- except to say I might not be in too good a shape Friday evening.  Will you
guys be back in town after your trip East long enough to spend an evening with
you?  If not, let's at least do lunch some day next week - I have Tuesday thru
Thur open - and would love to have Pete join us - my treat.  dn

We're flying back East on Sunday.  You are invited to come over Friday
evening, if you like.  Some of our other friends have asked to get together so
we're inviting people for pot luck.  we'll supply the beer.  Feel free to
bring your mom too. Or we could do something else, before Sunday.

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan

Rick --

I agree with Mary that it may make sense if this guy is able to be on at our 
next meeting (if space/time permits).  If it's ok, maybe Ginger can work with 
Mary to arrange.

This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a 
guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including 
a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He 
wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed 
to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings 
with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to 
enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a 
presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having 
people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in?

Subject: RE: Thank you


You're very welcome for both.
BTW, I have meant to check in with you about a piece of work we're
considering doing.  I've mentioned to Tim and to Sue, but wanted to also get
your feedback.

BPA TBL has asked for my support on RTO-West.  Mostly I'll be supporting
them on drafting settlements algorithms and protocols for the policies
already determined there.  But they may ask me to do other things along the
way too.  I've already said I wouldn't want to advocate on their behalf on
any issues that do not align with what Carl I has been advocating.  Further,
I've restated my personal, and TCA's corporate, position of open markets and
said that I would not advocate for any position that goes against that.

Carl feels we'll come up with better solutions if I work with them than we
will if they use somebody less thoughtful.

Please let me know if you have any concerns at this point.  Otherwise I'll
simply raise any potential conflict issues with you as they arise in the
course of doing work.

Best wishes,
Ellen.

No we're not interested in intervening.  This filing is to carry out the 
settlement I negotiated.  I'm the person on the floor who is familiar with 
the services we purchase.

Lysa,

Please view the attachment and download the BPA tariff filing to the p: drive 
and let me know where it is.  If you have trouble downloading fromt the FERC 
site, try BPA (my guess is that it will be easier to get from BPA than 
through FERC).

This can wait until next week.


Thank you,

Apparently BPA is filing for new transmission and A/S  rates effective 
10/1/01.  Is there an interest in:

intervening? (I assume no)
getting a copy of the filing? (I assume yes)

Who on our floor is familar with the BPA transmission and A/S services we 
currently purchase?

Alan:

See the first notice regarding BPA

Dan, Dan and Tom:

See the last notice on GridFlorida regarding comments on the revised RTO 
filing due on January 5.  As you know, we've joined in a group asking for an 
extension until February 6 (or at least January 30).  FERC has not acted on 
the request yet.

Steve

I attach the form of refund letter you sent, redlined with suggested 
revisions. One matter I have not addressed:  The letter is not explicit as to 
how any reduced amount from a resale of power will be allocated between 
Enron's and the customer's share of the resale revenue; if the underlying 
agreement is not clear on this point, an appropriate additional sentence 
might be added.

Today I spoke with Mr. Fergus, who asked me to send him a copy of the letter 
for his review and comment before it went out.   I also spoke with Mr. 
Haedicke, who instructed me to send him or Mr. Sanders an information of copy 
of materials I send to Mr. Fergus.  I thus have addressed copies of the 
redline to each of these individuals.

I will be out of town Tuesday (back Wednesday).  However, I request that you 
confirm whether Mr. Fergus has any reservations about the form of the letter.

you make the arguments, just please make them.

I have tracked down an old memo written by the Chief Counsel of Federal 
Affairs for Niagara Mohawk, summarizing positions taken in requests for 
rehearing of Order No. 888 to close the bypass loophole.  She discusses how 
there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities' distribution systems 
in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them 
how much money they might lose if they couldn't figure out a way to recover 
these costs.  Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases 
involving New York utilities.

Subject: Re: Stranded costs  

I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a 
response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted 
Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).

In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the 
departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee.  
Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for 
stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for 
recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before 
July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or 
provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810.  
There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For 
contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that 
allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives 
notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent 
utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a 
stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to 
recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the 
customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable 
expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the 
customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission 
service.
If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a 
notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 
proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, 
wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the 
incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost 
recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order 
No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed 
for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim 
in that case.  Id.
The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to 
address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail 
wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their 
prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to 
recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have 
authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required.  
Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual 
states have done.

I hope this helps.

Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several 
years ago.  However, the commercial people would like to market this possibly 
to others, not simply wholesale customers.  What happens at the retail level 
on stranded costs?  Thanks.

Subject: Re: Stranded costs  

This is a FERC issue because its would involve wholesale stranded costs.  Joe 
and Sarah will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Order 888 provides that 
if the muni (or other wholesale customer) is able to bypass the transmission 
facilities of its former provider (and I believe there is dispute over what 
constitutes bypass) then they may be able to avoid stranded cost liability.

Subject: Stranded costs

I had a question from the commercial people about whether a muni could build 
a new interconnection to another utility to avoid stranded costs of the 
incumbent utility.  While the particular question happened to be in Indiana 
(and I sent them to Janine), they were stating that this stranded cost 
avoidance is something that they may want to tout as a benefit of building 
new interconnections.

I think that we would look initially to the state restructuring law  to see 
if this is specifically addressed.  However, I recall someone saying that 
there may be a constitutional question as to whether an incumbent utility can 
charge stranded costs to someone who leaves its system, but I don't think 
this has been addressed at the appellate or Supreme Court level.  I want to 
make sure that our commercial people know what is the status of the law in 
this area.

I would appreciate any help on this.  Thanks.

We should probably make sure we're coordinated on this one.  Greg Wolfe has a 
history on this one--apparently we've been contacted by Puget in the past, by 
certain of the customers in the past, and by consultants to the customers.  
Also, Dave Fuller was inquiring about Puget's customers as well.   

I know a bunch of the folks involved and may be able to help bridge some of 
the gaps--but my contacts are certainly not unique.  

As a final note, we need to be careful as Robert McCullough used to consult 
for Bellingham Cold Storage and GP--two of the companies involved in the 
mess.  Robert is not a friend of ours.

Air Liquide et al v. PSE 

        Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 

        This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of 
a "soft
        cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers. 

        On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint 
answer on
        the rate cap mechanism. 

        On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power 
rates
        paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A
        short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power 
costs
        if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. 

        The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the 
level of the
        temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and 
the
        PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place 
pending
        further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48. 

        Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, 
Air Liquide
        America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and
        Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., 
King
        County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview,
        Qwest and MCI WorldCo

I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a

Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez=

It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government=

also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also=

which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin=

benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate=

re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average=20

RE: NERC Summit
      ? Wednesday, April 18, at 10 a.m.

The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on 
Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called "NERC to 
NAERO transition."  NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board 
structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent 
board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee.  This 
watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies, 
to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the 
activities in the regions.

Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently 
addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA 
and/or its members.  For those issues that are affecting, or could 
potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the 
most efficient and effective role EPSA could play?  What is the best forum 
for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?

To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to 
discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for 
EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at 
10 a.m.  We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at 
1401 New York Ave., 11th Floor, Washington, D.C.  However, we will also make 
participation by conference call available.  We encourage all companies, 
whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this 
important meeting.

Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either 
by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).

Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to

We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Sue,

I noticed Hoecker's statement too.  I do not, however, believe that he is 
breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I 
believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual 
Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible 
authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 "refund 
effective date."  (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to 
Section 309 is on page 11.)

Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take 
action "necessary and proper" to carry out the other substantive provisions 
of the Act, such as ensuring "just and reasonable" rates under Section 206 of 
the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not 
expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other 
provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for 
it to fill in the "missing blanks" in the substantive provisions of the Act, 
such as Sec. 206.)

Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water 
Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.  Here, Hoecker is 
simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller 
violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in "collusion, 
predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices."  As long as EPMI 
followed  the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in 
Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine 
prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules 
prior to 10/2/00; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, 
nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition 
of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date 
(10/2/00).

Ron

Dan and/or Ron,

Hoecker is quoted here as saying (p.2) that FERC has all the authority it
needs to "disgorge" profits under Section 309 of the FPA.  What are your
thoughts?  Is this the first time that section has been mentioned?

DJ FERC Affirms It Lacks Jurisdiction In Pwr Facility Sales
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.



WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday reaffirmed its policy finding that it lacks jurisdiction over 
generation facility transfers.

     The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional 
asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view 
generation assets as jurisdictional.

     FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context 
of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the 
generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that 
produce the power.

     With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in 
the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been 
questioned by consumer interests and others.

     Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power 
Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its 
view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission 
facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.

     At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and 
FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility 
operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.

     The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power 
that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and 
promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.

     "There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale 
of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to 
our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself," 
FERC said.

     "Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there 
is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a 
contrary conclusion," FERC said, denying the petition.

     FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring 
authority to regulate the disposition of "facilities subject to the 
jurisdiction of the commission." FERC has never asserted jurisdiction over 
generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility 
regulators.

other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs).  
Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in 
California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW 
are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the 
remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs).  
Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is 
underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements.   
With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these 
underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak 
and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be 
immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or 
into the competitive market their "above-baseline" output for a limited time 
period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based 
rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency 
standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations 
provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency 
standards "upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy 
savings".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a 
number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the 
requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the 
request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an 
innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's 
goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here.  
Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this 
circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the 
Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through 
increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant 
temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration 
QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We 
will terminate the waiver effective January 1, 2001."
 
Let me know if you want the entire order.
 
Dan

Subject: ISO problems

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.

Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the 
Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of 
January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available 
transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this 
caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about 
$50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.  
This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity 
is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder 
what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take 
similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if 
there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like "economic" 
force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a 
Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to 
get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are 
more important than the NW's. 

Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis 
using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO 
advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.  
We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses 
transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our 
deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 
MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if 
exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to 
cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't 
thought of.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862.

I have recommended this before and continue to believe that it should (and 
could successfully) be pursued.  Could someone forward the Hendricks 
pleading?  On instruction from Richard, I would be happy to start the 
lobbying campaign at FERC (and possibly the SG's office as well) to secure 
such a supportive pleading.


>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 02/22/01 05:54PM >>>
Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in
the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file
a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field"
of wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered?

Lysa,

My new desk is very narrow but very deep. I think it would be good to have a 
low book shelf up against the back to maximize my ability to store stuff.  
Otherwise, this space is going to drive me nuts.   Can you do some looking 
around the floor or in a catalog?

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

Subject: Training on March 7th

The people on the "To" list have been selected to attend an "Energy Math" 
training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the 
River Room at Two World Trade Center.  Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with 
a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday 
morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this 
is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can 
find a replacement.

I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over 
the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the 
needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the 
foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a 
graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several 
people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently 
published.

This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being 
offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris 
Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity 
to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a 
cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of 
experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  
Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others 
are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to 
people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only 
responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give 
constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course 
better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide 
feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or 
don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us 
with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for 
the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list 
for this session.

Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the 
next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to 
improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance 
for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

Calif Senate Takes Up Bill On Deal With Small Generators
? 
02/23/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
(This article was originally published Thursday.) 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday 
introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and 
small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power 
supplies. 
The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying 
facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would 
require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover 
those costs from ratepayers. 
The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 2001, and would run until 
June 30, 2006. 
"This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis," Battin 
said in a press release. 
Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While 
the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies 
own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include 
Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG), 
Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out 
last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B). 
Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of 
gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those 
generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay 
gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments. 
The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is 
expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. reached 
an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if 
Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the 
agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators. 
Edison wasn't able to comment immediately. 
Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for 
two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the 
cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate 
five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a 
benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined. 
To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by 
two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a 
process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin. 
Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar 
panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of 
5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will 
also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the 
utilities. 
Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of 
natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the 
California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that 
the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months 
that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped 
operating its market. 
Both PG&E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the 
bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to 
pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May 
1, and for January 2001 deliveries by June 1. PG&E paid its November bill on 
time. 
Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's 
4,400 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying 
facilities under contract with PG&E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little 
more than 500 MW of the plants. 
U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such 
generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s.

I'm fine with this.  The only other legal point you might make is that the 
request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December 
15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on 
rehearing.

We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric.  
My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off 
LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, 
at least if their transmission is in RTO West.

Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this?  There have been a variety of 
problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy 
order.  Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation 
only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC 
filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want 
that result in a FERC order.)  In addition, while you were on vacation, 
Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project.  I don't know the 
status of that.  I am in a room reviewing etrans tariff, so page me if you 
want to talk about it.  800-778-8365.  Thanks.

Subject: ISO problems

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.

Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the 
Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of 
January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available 
transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this 
caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about 
$50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.  
This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity 
is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder 
what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take 
similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if 
there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like "economic" 
force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a 
Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to 
get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are 
more important than the NW's. 

Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis 
using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO 
advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.  
We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses 
transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our 
deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 
MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if 
exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to 
cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't 
thought of.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862.

ISO Market Participants:

On March 8, we notified you that the ISO had received a direct payment of
about $171 million from PG&E ($177 million less GMC obligation) with
direction from PG&E that these funds were in payment for transactions on the
ISO Controlled Grid in December 2000, scheduled by the California Power
Exchange (PX) as PG&E's Scheduling Coordinator, and invoiced to PG&E by the
PX for remittance to the ISO. We notified you further that the ISO had
placed these funds into a segregated interest-bearing account pending
resolution of their distribution.

The PX has provided notice that it has filed suit in the Central District of
California against the California ISO and moved for a temporary restraining
order (TRO), requiring the ISO to transfer these funds to the CalPX. Copies
of the complaint and the TRO application are attached below. As represented
by the PX in its complaint and moving papers, the ISO does not intend to
oppose the PX's TRO application. To the best of the ISO's knowledge, a
hearing on the TRO application has not yet been set.

It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.  Perhaps you 
should write a memo reviewing the FERC cases on this issue and if necessary, 
go talk to FERC about whether an RFP will be sufficient to set a just and 
reasonable rate.  Is that okay with you Jim?  Ron - how much would that cost?

Richard:  In connection with EPMI's contention in the various California 
litigations that they should be dismissed due to FERC's primary jurisdiction, 
it strikes me that it may be helpful to lodge FERC's March 9, 2001 order with 
the Court.  While FERC, in the 12/15 order, established its investigation, 
the March 9 order makes findings and imposes remedies (fortunately not 
against us).  This should enhance the primary jurisdiction argument.  FERC's 
intent to occupy the field could not be more clear.  Ron

CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual 
charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you

Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut 
transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have 
the same effect as cutting transmission to the north.  

Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue 
this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to 
Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be 
helpful?

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan

Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's 
proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also 
apply to the ISO Board's recent decision.

Subject: Motion for Interim Relief by CPUC



Mary:

cc: Ron, Jim

I have had a quick read-through of the CPUC Motion, as requested. There
would appear to be two salient points.

1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. These
would be imposed using a formula based on "margina1 heat rates" times an
index gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum
could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say this
does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It was
also completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices would
rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone
to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism is
basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacity
payments.

2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers
to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at
FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these are
like the UK and Australian "vesting contracts", but these involved
significant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that all
generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of
cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).

Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the
market for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits from
current long positions in the market.

The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the
objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. The
decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on
whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, making
the CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could be
taken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on the
market are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the market
would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these
levels.

Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and 
interconnection requests.  Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and 
the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree 
that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with 
FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable 
contracts by 2/28/01.  If we are going to make this demand we need to send 
this letter ASAP.

Subject: Re: Bankruptcy Notification to FERC


Because Avista is on Pacific Standard Time, it can't consider and respond to 
your invitation for comments by noon EST.  We will get back to you as soon as 
we can.  Our question is whether the proposed  notice of bankruptcy should 
categorically concede that FERC's charge back proceeding and all other 
pending FERC proceedings against the CalPX are automatically stayed?  Or 
should we leave room for the PX and the charge back complainants to work out 
an agreement that the charge back case does not involve the PX's assets, and 
thus is not subject to the stay?  We are seeking input from Avista's 
bankruptcy counsel.

I have attached a revised version to the complaint that I sent out last 
night, along with a redlined version.  In addition to some wordsmithing and 
the like, please note footnote 1, which is new.  We are still researching for 
California cases that support the FERC cases we have cited (for proposition 
that economic hardship does not constitute force majuere).

This needs to be filed today, so please give me your comments quickly.  
Thanks.  Ron

Market Participants:

As of trade date 2/12/01 the ISO began publishing estimated Daily cost
associated with Incremental Imbalance energy on the CAISO Webster
http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/pubmkt2.html under button #46 Imbalance
Energy Costs.  This information is presented as follows:
1. As-Bid:  Energy purchased via BEEP but with bids above the soft-cap
of $150.
2. Daily MCP:  Energy purchased via BEEP at or below soft cap that will
settle at MCP.
3. Out-of-Market:  Energy purchased out-of-market.

This Market data is available at 1800 hours on the day following the
applicable trade date.
The ISO did receive requests for hourly breakdown of these values.   At this
point, we have only received approval to publish Daily Averages.
The ISO has also posted historical data file for this same energy purchase
data for the period Nov 1, 2000 through Feb 11, 2001.  This historical data

IssueAlert for  March 5, 2001 

PGOCorp. Receives $1 Billion To Partially Pay Off Debts

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

PGOCorp., parent of nearly bankrupt utility PGOCo., announced that it has 
closed a $1 billion loan agreement that will allow it to pay various debts 
including its defaulted fourth quarter dividend to shareholders. The loans, 
provided by GE Capital Structured Finance Group and Lehman Brothers, will be 
secured by the company's equity interest in PGONational Energy Group LLC.  

Analysis: Although this may seem like a positive step for the troubled 
utility, PGOCo.'s partial payment pales in comparison to its outstanding 
debt. Making matters even worse for the company is a new wave of lawsuits 
seeking restitution in the amount of $3 billion. 

The loans, which PGOCorp. was able to secure due to the strong performance of 
its National Energy Group subsidiary, have enabled the corporation to "pay 
its outstanding debt obligations on which it has defaulted or would default 
in the near future." The obligations that have been paid include: $501 
million in payments to commercial paper holders, $434 million in borrowings 
under a revolving credit agreement, and $116 million owned to PGOCorporation 
common shareholders for the defaulted 4Q 2000 dividend. The loan, which has a 
term of two years, includes an option that, "depending on certain factors," 
would give the lenders between 2 and 3 percent of the shares in National 
Energy Group. In addition, the loan agreement prohibits PGOfrom declaring or 
paying future common stock dividends until the loans are repaid.  

In an effort to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy, on Jan. 10 PGOCorp. 
halted payment of its fourth quarter dividend, which had been declared on 
Oct. 18, 2000, and was due to be payable on Jan. 15. Soon after that, the 
company announced that it would not be able to make certain payments on 
commercial paper obligations. 

Citing that the risk of bankruptcy played a factor in assuming the loan, 
PGOCorp. CEO and President Robert Glynn said that the financing would be 
repaid with PGOCorp. shareholder dollars only. In other words, Glynn 
reassured customers of the utility that rates would not be increased as a 
mechanism to repay this loan. However, PGOcontinues its negotiations with 
Calif. Gov. Gray Davis to increase rates for at least a substantial part of 
losses already accrued due to skyrocketing prices in the wholesale market. 
Reportedly, as of Dec. 31, PGOhad racked up more than $6 billion in 
undercollected costs.  

In its 8K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PGOCorp. 
acknowledged that it would be damaged further if the California Public 
Utilities Commission adopts current power payment proposals without an 
electric rate increase. Meanwhile, a pending deal between PGOand Gov. Davis 
is expected to include the sale of the utility's transmission assets to the 
state of California, much like PG&E's counterpart Southern California Edison 
(SCE) has already done.  

The bottom line of the loans is that PGOis "removed from being in default on 
its credit agreements," according to Greg Pruett, vice president of corporate 
communications in an interview with CBS.MarketWatch.com. Pruett also said 
that the loans amounted to "one less item of significance" that the holding 
company has to attend to ensure it doesn't find itself "in a situation where 
it could have creditors seeking to force it into bankruptcy." 

However, as noted, just as PGOCorp. received this loan, the parent company 
and the utility announced that they have been hit with two lawsuits seeking a 
total of nearly $3 billion in restitution. PGOCorp. and PGOCo., on the basis 
of the newly secured loan, say that they can only make partial payments of $1 
billion. Both lawsuits were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on 
Feb. 13. According to CBSMarketWatch.com, one lawsuit alleges that PGOCorp. 
violated its fiduciary duties by repurchasing common share of its PGOCo. unit 
at a price of $2.3 billion. The second lawsuit claims that PGOCorp. collected 
nearly $2.96 billion from PGOCo. under a tax-sharing arrangement, but paid 
only $2.29 billion to all governments under the arrangement. The plaintiff in 
both suits is identified only as Richard D. Wilson, who seeks to enjoin any 
more such buybacks unless "good cause" is shown, and also seeks restitution 
of $2.3 billion, with interest, from PGOCorp. The parent company and utility 
have discounted the validity of the lawsuits, although they said they were 
unable to predict any outcome or how it might their financial conditions. 

In its most recent filing with the SEC, PGOalso disclosed that the utility 
unit owes $1.1 billion to the California Independent System Operator for 
December energy purchases, and another $331 million to a group of 
unidentified power generators for January deliveries. At that time, which was 
only a few days before PGOCorp. secured the loans, the company said it could 
only make partial payments of these debts on a pro rata basis. As a result, 
PGOCorp said it could only pay the California ISO about $177 million, and 
make payments of $51 million to the power suppliers. It appears that PGOCorp. 
has not used any of the funds secured in its loans to make additional 
payments to the California ISO or power suppliers. 

As noted, PG&E's subsidiary National Energy Group played a prominent role in 
its parent's loans. The loans will be secured by the company's equity 
interest in National Energy Group, and the lenders could potentially gain a 2 
or 3 percent interest in the subsidiary. National Energy Group is PGOCorp.'s 
unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast, primarily in 
New England. PGOCorp. has previously claimed that its goal is for National 
Energy Group to be in a position to contribute 30 percent of earnings for the 
parent company by 2002. While the regulated PGOCo. continues to struggle in 
debt, National Energy Group has been quite successful. In fact, much of 
PGOCorp.'s earnings over 2000 came directly from National Energy Group, which 
gained a 233-percent profit increase in 2Q 2000 and an 22-percent profit 
increase in 3Q 2000. Clearly, PGOCorp. has benefited greatly from National 
Energy Group's ability, as an unregulated subsidiary, to sell power outside 
in deregulated markets outside of California. Thus, it is no wonder that, 
although PGOCorp. still considers California to be an attractive market, the 
core driver of its strategy is NEG, which is able to operate in all lucrative 
markets as they become deregulated. 

Just last month, PGOCorp. gained approval to implement a shrewd restructuring 
of its business units that protects National Energy Group (and other 
high-profit subsidiaries) from any impact that the bankruptcy of the 
regulated utility or parent company might cause. In other words, if PGOCorp. 
and PGOCo. ultimately declare bankruptcy, subsidiaries such as National 
Energy Group would not bear any foreseeable impact, protecting some of PG&E's 
most profitable business units from financial insolvency. Ironically, 
however, through this loan there is now a tie between the unregulated 
business of National Energy Group and the regulated PGOCo., although the 
ramifications of this connection are not completely clear at this time.  

Moreover, while the loan that PGOhas secured certainly helps, it by no means 
brings an end to the utility's financial problems. Through the loan, PGOhas 
been enabled to pay outstanding debt obligations on which it has already 
defaulted or may default on in the near future. However, the payments made in 
the amount of $1 billion only reflect a small percentage of PG&E's reported 
$6 billion of total debt. Thus, bankruptcy is still a strong possibility for 
the company unless some other new major development occurs. Most likely, this 
development will be the sale of its transmission system to the state. PGOmay 
have to lower its expectations of what it believes its system to be worth 
(reportedly $1 billion). However, just as SCE has now been apparently 
protected from bankruptcy filing due to the sale of its own transmission 
system, PGOmay also find that an asset sale is its only recourse at this 
juncture.

Roger,

I did a brief summary of this last week which I will copy below.

I do not have any sense of whether the proposed change will be accepted,=20

If you need any detail, I think you will find it in one of the ISO's=20

I know if you believe we should intervene/protest.

Summary of ISO Amendment 34:

Filed: December 28

Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)

Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)

Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t=
o=20
clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi=
on=20
Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.=20
(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended=

and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a par=
ty=20
to these settlements?)) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Acce=

Charge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci=
ty=20
of Vernon joining the ISO effective January 1, 2001 and the amount of Firm=
=20
Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO=
=20
Tariff.

Specific Proposed Changes

Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity

The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the=
=20
determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u=
se=20
transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20
Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20
contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th=
e=20
ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.

New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo=
logy

The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates=
=20
based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating=
=20
TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they=
=20
are known as =01&license plate=018 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this met=
hodology=20
continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that=
=20
occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be=
=20
assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen=
ts=20
of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.

The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where=
in=20
new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst=
em=20
average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=
 1=20
high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren=
t=20
method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge=
s,=20
PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and=20
Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.

Vernon=01,s Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs

Veron, by joining the ISO effective 1/1/01, agrees to convert existing=20
transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount.  The propos=

Mary,
 One of the issues in January that helped us along the path of not
reporting to FERC December over cap sales in addition to not being required
yet under the tariff was the question of how to match cost to sales in
California.  If the data is due tomorrow, we will need to decide how to
resolve that issue first thing tomorrow.

Thanks
Gary

The ISO is now saying that it has the authority to require EPMI to report
our prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market
Monitoring Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit
very broad authority to request information, specifically: "the submission
of any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be
potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose
activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."

Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not
order us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now
requesting it.  I think our only available approach is to provide the
information to the ISO pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have
asked Sue Mara if she would contact WPTF about negotiating a
confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please advise if this is the proper
course of action.  Please note, the information is due tomorrow.

I agree with Dan.  Have we sold above the cap?  If so, report.  If not,
tell them we will let them know when we do.----cgy

If we haven't sold anything over the cap, then I would go with #3:  Report
that we haven't and that we shan't report until we do.

>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 02/28/01 07:03PM >>>
By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting
the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO
transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded
that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing
rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be
quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding
that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has
correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.

The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement
actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above
the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could
do one of several things for you at this point:
   Stay quiet
   Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)
   Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and
   will not report unless and until we do
   Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back
   Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA

I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the
"Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm
inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please
verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first 
draft of the RTO West tariff glossary.  In addition to making the changes we 
discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of 
adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma 
(changing "Transmisison Provider" to "RTO West" where applicable).  I 
recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new 
types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions 
available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and 
we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma 
and throughout the RTO West tariff.

Subject: Re: Conference Call/PX Response


Our comments and proposed edits (using the Comments and Track Changes 
features of MSWord) are attached.

>>> "ELAINE E. HUFF" <EHUFF@LLGM.COM> 03/20 4:59 PM >>>
Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion 
for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.  As an initial caveat, we have 
prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.  Like the rest of the Group, we 
have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we 
reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we 
expect the rest of the Group will.  In addition, we have the following 
comments:

1.  In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of 
preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the 
preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant 
general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.  It seems 
to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should 
proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking 
further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve 
the charge-back issues.  Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to 
address this issue in the response.  The Group may want to consider 
approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.

2.  Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding 
as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.  We have tried 
to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is 
simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete 
relief as part of the Debtor's motion.  If the Debtor objects to the expanded 
relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically 
the subject of the motion.  We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to 
help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional 
motion for relief.

3.  Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the 
appropriate counsel is listed.  I am trying to simply list the "bankruptcy" 
counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is 
any question relative to a party.  We have not intentionally left anybody 
off.  If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them 
to the list.

If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it 
to the other members of group.

We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.  The 
dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883.  The confirmation number is 5096040.  If 
you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New 
York at 212/424-8482 or Jim Huemoeller at 303/291-2632.

Subject: Public Hydro Data Sources

Mary:

The public data sources that we routinely use for historical, realtime and 
forecast hydroelectric data are:

 http://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil This site is operated by the Northwest 
Division of the US Army Corp of Engineers, and includes both historical and 
near-realtime water and power data for all Corp Columbia basin projects, as 
well as major USBR projects and non-federal mid-Columbia plants;

 http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov This site is operated by the Northwest River 
Forecast Center. It includes both assessments of current Columbia basin 
streamflow conditions and forecasts of future conditions;

 http://www.mp.usbr.gov This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes 
current data and forecasts for California's Central Valley Project (CVP) 
plants;

 http://www.uc.usbr.gov  This is a Bureau of Reclamation site that publishes 
data and forecasts for Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) plant water 
releases and power production;

 http://h2o.usgs.gov  This is a Geological Survey site that publishes 
near-realtime data from automated streamflow gages, and

 http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/ This is a site operated by the 
University of Washington that provides convenient access to historical 
Columbia River and tributary water data.

Of these, the sites most relevant to recent markets are probably the Corp' 
Northwest Division site, which offers enough near-realtime generation data to 
directly account for 75% to 80% of Columbia River energy production, and the 
River Forecast Center, which provides snowpack-driven, long range volume 
runoff forecasts. The CVP data are a helpful index of California hydro 
conditions, but only represent about 10% of the state's installed hydro 
capacity.

Please forward this information to appropriate FERC staff.

Subject: CONFERENCE CALL MONDAY AT 3:00


PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern 
with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss 
the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the 
Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the 
Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy.
Dial-in #: 1-800-403-2008
Participants #: 143570
The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:

1.  Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; 
including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of 
motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's 
motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing 
date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;

2.  Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of 
collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.

3.  Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all 
collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing 
and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs.  
In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds 
the total of the foregoing matters?

4.  Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to 
PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the 
timing of such filings with FERC.

This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties.  If you wish 
to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of 
the time and relevant information for the call.
This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties 
to consolidate their participants where possible.  Also, please do not 
forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters.  
Thanks.  See you Monday.  Ron

Subject: Filings to buy power from industrials

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and 
EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer 
filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power 
into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for 
these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  
We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.

Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC 
power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar 
to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file 
specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the 
industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  

Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  
We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may 
be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi  
37007.

Subject: Chairman Hoecker Tenders Resignation Effective Jan. 18

At the FERC Commission meeting this morning, Chairman Hoecker announced his 
resignation from the Commission effective January 18.  

Other Items at the Meeting:
Hoecker summarized the meetings that occurred last night with Cal. Gov. 
Davis, Energy Sec. Richardson, Clinton Administration officials and industry 
representatives.  He said that the parties had produced a statement of 
principles on resolving the Calif. issues.  Specifically, he mentioned that 
the principles include a discussion of the regional nature of the market.
Order on GridFlorida.   When GridFlorida made its RTO filing, they asked the 
Commission for an expedited order providing guidance on certain independence 
and governance matters.  This order provides guidance on:
The process for selecting the RTO board
The process for selecting a CEO and directors
Rules for financial holdings by RTO board members.
Items Struck form Agenda:  The Commission did not act on Illinois Power's 
requests to leave the Midwest ISO or the Alliance second RTO  filing.  
Commissioner Massey criticized the Commission for being slow to act on these 
items.  He said that at the heart of both of these filings is the issue of 
scope/configuration of RTOs.   He shared his belief that the Midwest must be 
treated on a regional basis.
El Paso v. CPUC complaint.  This proceeding involves CPUC's complaint that 
affiliate El Paso Merchant is improperly hoarding El Paso Natural Gas 
capacity to California.   The Commission did not discuss the draft order.  
However, Hebert noted that he had dissented from the order.

Nice final flame!

Hoecker's Last Word:Calif Must Adopt 'Realistic' Pwr Plan
  
01/19/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- California officials have shown "bald disregard" for 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing short-sighted 
policies that will push the state's two largest utilities over the brink and 
into bankruptcy, FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday. 


The remarks by Hoecker, who resigned as chairman effective Thursday, came in 
a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words 
on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California.


Hoecker lambasted Gov. Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the 
state's power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts. 


State officials ignored the commission's Dec. 15 market-restructuring order 
and instead embraced "conspiracy theories, resistance to more realistic 
rates, and calls for palliative price caps...to obscure the issues and delay 
solutions," Hoecker said. 


White House-brokered negotiations to develop power-supply contracts as part 
of a near-term solution are at an impasse due to "unrealistic" demands by 
Gov. Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost 
of production, Hoecker said. 


He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic 
position that retail rates continue to be frozen at below-present-cost, 
pre-1996 levels. 


Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies, Edison 
International's Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific 
Gas & Electric Co. (PCG), will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the 
state's flawed market-restructuring law, Hoecker said. 


"Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted. If it cannot, perhaps it will force 
debtors, creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of 
utilities in a new light, without recrimination and posturing," he said. 


"Let's be realistic," Hoecker said. "Wall Street and consumers share one 
critical trait: Without a reasonable, technically defensible and 
comprehensive set of solutions to such crises, they have no basis for 
confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support 
investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other." 


Hoecker called for state officials to "expeditiously" implement the 
provisions of FERC's Dec. 15 order. 


In particular, he said, the California Power Exchange is making the financial 
situation worse by ignoring the order's provision calling for suspension of 
the single-price auction when prices bid exceed $150 per megawatt-hour. 


"Prices above the level allowed in the Dec. 15 order (have) further 
jeopardized the financial status of California utilities," he said. 


Reaching a deal on forward contracts, as called for in FERC's order, is 
essential, Hoecker said. "An arbitrary bottom-line solution cannot be 
prescribed without regard to costs," he said. 


But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the state's first 
legislative response to the crisis, which Davis signed into law Thursday, to 
replace the California Independent System Operator's industry-participant 
governing board with a board of political state appointees. 


Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO, a FERC-jurisdictional entity, 
represents "an unacceptable intrusion...into federally regulated power 
markets," Hoecker said. 


Further, he said, FERC made "mistakes" in allowing AB 1890, the state's 
electricity restructuring law, to usurp the commission's regulatory authority 
over wholesale power markets in the first place. 


"Because the state is now clearly a market participant, the independence of 
the (ISO) board is bound to be compromised. Consequently, the state's 
decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it 
since AB 1890," Hoecker said. 


"More than that, this action evinces a bald disregard for federal 
jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions (called for in FERC's 
Dec. 15 restructuring order)," Hoecker said. "I recommend that the commission 
seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its 
authority." 


Hoecker rejected the state's continuing call for firm price caps in the 
region. "Price caps will only jeopardize reliability, mask problems 
temporarily, and deter or destroy any chance to solve the long-term supply 
challenge," he said. 


Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers, regardless of whether the 
utilities enter bankruptcy. 


"We cannot...keep moving from one failure to the next, with no agreed-upon 
objectives. The governor's stated plans are unrealistic and ours' cannot be 
fully implemented without his help," Hoecker concluded. "I urge state 
policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the 
interests of California consumers."

Jay--Couple notes:

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers "material changes".  You 
may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok 
with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to 
should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.

Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on "commenced 
construction."  What I mean by "commenced" includes the utility purchase of 
easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing 
to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to 
proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the 
costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC 
decision.]]  Thanks.

I agree with Dave.  I'd agrue for 120 if I thought I could get away with it.

Frankly, I am more comfortable with 90 days.  Its easier to complete a 
project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go 
back and ask for more time.  Depending on the size of the plant and location, 
we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to 
verify ratings.  I'll ask Gary Lindland how he feels about reducing the time 
line.

Any feedback on Enron's comments on our draft interconnection procedures that 
Jay sent out last night?  Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the 
phone to incorporate some changes.  In particular, Enron wants us to put in a 
shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather 
than 90 days).  Enron says we would still have the flexibility to take longer 
if we notify the customer that we need more time.  How do Dave and Jim feel 
about that proposal?

Subject: FERC grants EPMI changes in APS' Interconnection Procedures

On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona 
Public Service interconnection procedures:

APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which 
a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the 
VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the 
Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC).
APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, 
Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies.

These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in 
other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets.

Subject: Losses using PacifiCorp Transmission

Brian McCellan from PacifiCorp Transmission called this morning to let me 
know that as of 1/1/2001 that Pac has begun charging for losses for 
transmission schedules using Non-Firm and Short Term transmission service. 
The losses will be .045 percent of the schedule. Pac offers the option of 
either settling losses financially or physically. 

The consensus is that Enron will settle losses financially using a index 
price, that Pac will supply, based on the Mid-Columbia, COB,4C and PV 
indexes. 

Currently Mary Hain has the official declaration form showing Enron is 
selecting financial settlements vs. physical. Until Mary returns and has the 
declaration executed I have notified Brain that Enron will settle losses 
financially.

Regards,

Les Rawson

Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities 
                     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
                     12/13/2000 
                     Dow Jones Energy Service 
                     (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
                      
                     By Mark Golden 

                     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the 
California Independent System Operator reflect the
                     credit problems of the state's three investor-owned 
utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean
                     said Wednesday. 
                      
                      
                     "We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' 
creditworthiness," Kean said. "They wouldn't have
                     this credit issue if they had a government guarantee." 

                     Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California 
utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that
                     such a guarantee is highly unlikely. 

                     "There's no point in talking about it," Cortright said. 

                     The credit-rating agency put California utility holding 
companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison
                     International (EIX) on watch with negative implications 
Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt
                     rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are 
piling up by the billions as they continue to pay
                     about 10 times more for power supplies than they can 
charge customers. 

                     "The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is 
beyond belief," Cortright said. "Wholesale prices
                     have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets 
more dire." 

                     Cortright said the only step that would save the 
utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the
                     rates the utilities can charge customers. 

                     Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties 
Commission indicated that it may do so, reversing a
                     decision made just last week. 

                     "With new generation coming on, you would expect the 
rates to decline in a couple of years," Cortright
                     said. 

                     The California Independent System Operator almost had to 
institute rolling blackouts Wednesday
                     because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
concerns about the ISO's credit. 

                     California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of 
the "dirty 13." 

                     Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very 
limited amounts of power to the ISO. 

                     "We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control 
only 70 megawatts of generation in the state, which
                     we offered to the ISO today because of the emergency, 
but the ISO declined to purchase that power,"
                     Kean said. 

                     That small generating unit is located in the southern 
California, while the ISO's supply problems were
                     most acute in northern California. 

                     "We aren't selling any other power to them right now. 
Everything else that we bought we've sold to other
                     buyers," said Kean, who added that Enron had sold to the 
ISO as recently as Tuesday. 

                     The ISO manages California's electricity grid and 
purchases last-minute additional power on behalf of the
                     state's three investor-owned utilities. The ISO then 
bills the utilities, which are PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas &
                     Electric Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern 
California Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San
                     Diego Gas & Electric Co. 

                     The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers. 

                     For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the 
ISO has been purchasing about one-fourth of
                     the state's entire needs at very high prices. It's 
current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to
                     $100 million.

Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to 
terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as 
Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached 
explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we 
also need to file a termination for EES?

Dan,
At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we 
default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or 
tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will 
suddenly be:  how does one make sure one is not the last man standing?  It 
would seem that if it is possible to ever become a  "former"   participant in 
the PX and not a "current" one, ("current" being  the word used in the tariff 
to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, 
to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and 
CTS markets.  Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a 
possible extradited extraction from the PX.  Thanks.----cgy

I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate 
EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX.  In addition to the letter to 
the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to 
terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale 
agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I 
prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing 
necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the 
60-day notice period.

I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter.

Steve

The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file 
with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices 
over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The 
ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked 
the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the 
FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would 
like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this 
information with the ISO and EOB. 

I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the 
conference call tomorrow.

Subject: Reporting Requirements for December

The ISO appears to have taken it upon itself to get above $250/MWh costs for 
the month of December pursuant to the Dec 8, 2000 emergency order.

Mary, Steve and I need to confirm that these data are in fact required to be 
reported by that Order.  (Mary, can you point me to our copy of that 
emergency order?)

Chris,  can you run a report for December 8-31 to see what accepted bids may 
be reportable?  During the breakpoint was $250, not $150.

I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a 
response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted 
Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).

In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the 
departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee.  
Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for 
stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for 
recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before 
July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or 
provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810.  
There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For 
contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that 
allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives 
notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent 
utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a 
stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to 
recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the 
customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable 
expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the 
customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission 
service.
If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a 
notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 
proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, 
wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the 
incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost 
recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order 
No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed 
for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim 
in that case.  Id.
The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to 
address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail 
wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their 
prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to 
recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have 
authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required.  
Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual 
states have done.

I hope this helps.

Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several 
years ago.  However, the commercial people would like to market this possibly 
to others, not simply wholesale customers.  What happens at the retail level 
on stranded costs?  Thanks.

This is a FERC issue because its would involve wholesale stranded costs.  Joe 
and Sarah will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Order 888 provides that 
if the muni (or other wholesale customer) is able to bypass the transmission 
facilities of its former provider (and I believe there is dispute over what 
constitutes bypass) then they may be able to avoid stranded cost liability.

Subject: Stranded costs

I had a question from the commercial people about whether a muni could build 
a new interconnection to another utility to avoid stranded costs of the 
incumbent utility.  While the particular question happened to be in Indiana 
(and I sent them to Janine), they were stating that this stranded cost 
avoidance is something that they may want to tout as a benefit of building 
new interconnections.

I think that we would look initially to the state restructuring law  to see 
if this is specifically addressed.  However, I recall someone saying that 
there may be a constitutional question as to whether an incumbent utility can 
charge stranded costs to someone who leaves its system, but I don't think 
this has been addressed at the appellate or Supreme Court level.  I want to 
make sure that our commercial people know what is the status of the law in 
this area.

I would appreciate any help on this.  Thanks.

I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled 
by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of 
it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO 
West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If 
we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of 
like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would 
try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at 
least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join.

Sue,

I am amending my previous statement about the 2-year delay in creating a
multi-state RTO.  If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CA
utilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the California
IOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge and
be up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO before
the end of the year.  This was basically what I had been trying to
achieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO and
DSTAR parties about merging the two.

Why not lobby for that as the FERC-preferred solution to the state's
illegal takeover of CAISO governance?

Carl

As I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in 
APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in 
June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load, 
even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners 
uneconomically.  Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells 
transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the 
hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest.  If you could 
figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS 
in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet.  However, I would wait 
to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests 
to APS'  transmission function given that the traders question whether APS 
may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function.  Depending on what 
APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you 
have to request transmission on-line.  I will help you do this when you're 
ready.

I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they 
have transmission for the project, but the cite was down.  I'll check again 
today.

hoepfully, by summer (originally, it was locomotive engines, but now may be 
turbines).  They want to have a high level contact between Enron and APS to

Here's the answer to your question about paragraphs 42 and 44 of Duke's 
complaint.  Although CDWR is technically the SC for the UDCs in the short 
term bilateral market and the ISO, as a practical matter, if CDWR does not 
like the prices offered in the bilateral market, it waits to buy the power 
from the ISO.  Then  CDWR reviews the price of the ISO's purchases and 
(according to an article in Megawatt daily) it "does not authorize the 
payment at prices it deems unreasonable."

By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude 
the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was 
free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate 
scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had 
failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing 
prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order 
prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly 
discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its 
forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing 
of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from 
the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..   See attached order.

Subject: RTO West Transfer Payments --- Much Better Example

Please ignore the transfer payment example I sent earlier in the day.  When 
we were unable to talk on the phone, I kept working on the example and added 
panels to show each step in the process.   I have also prepared a short note 
to describe the pricing provisions of the Transmission Operating Agreement 
which trigger the transfer payments.  The spreadsheet has notes which explain 
the process.  It also assumes that a volumetric export fee is not added.  
Hopefully we can find a time to talk about these documents to make sure I 
have communitcated the issue.

Subject:  AG suit to oust ISO Board

ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD
Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members

January 23, 2001
01-006
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the
26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator
Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly
reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.

The "quo warranto" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court.
The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from
their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an
opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.

The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which
reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the
governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.

Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing
board pursuant to the new law.

The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the
power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and
between neighboring states.

Can you get a positive upside over the costs for next summer at least?  Also, 
we think that in order to set up a load only control area, you have to have 
firm transmission paths to generation sources (but if you  want to pursue 
this, I need to pull the NERC rules on that issue to be certain of the 
requirements.  We only set up generation only control areas.  Mary, the 6 or 
so requirements are on the NERC web site.)  thanks.

We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric.  
My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off 
LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, 
at least if their transmission is in RTO West.

Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this?  There have been a variety of 
problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy 
order.  Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation 
only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC 
filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want 
that result in a FERC order.)  In addition, while you were on vacation, 
Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project.  I don't know the 
status of that.  I am in a room reviewing etrans tariff, so page me if you 
want to talk about it.  800-778-8365.  Thanks.

This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a 
guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including 
a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He 
wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed 
to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings 
with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to 
enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a 
presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having 
people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in?

By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting 
the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO 
transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded 
that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing 
rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be 
quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding that 
we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly 
interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.

The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions 
against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price 
cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could do one of 
several things for you at this point:
Stay quiet
Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)
Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will 
not report unless and until we do
Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back
Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA

I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the 
"Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm 
inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please 
verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

Steve Walton has suggested the following definitions concepts for definitions 
of "Congestion Zone" and "Flowpath"

Congestion Zone - Segment of Electric System within which there is minimal 
congestion between busses.

Flowpath - A facility or set of facilities that represent commercially 
significant constraints within the transmission system.

As we discussed, Steve affirmed that these are terms of art.

This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a 
guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including 
a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He 
wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed 
to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings 
with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to 
enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a 
presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having 
people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in?

                and North Carolina Attached
? Comments Due By Wednesday, April 4th, Close of Business

Most of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft 
or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the 
rule's emission-reduction requirements.  U.S. EPA is in various stages of 
reviewing and taking action on the plans.  It is expected that Northeastern 
states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the 
first to be submitted.

North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans 
for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule.  Both of their rules, as currently 
drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.  
Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the 
number of allowances available to new generating facilities.

EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable 
approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to 
support capacity additions.  A copy of the drafts is attached for review.  
Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202) 
628-8200 or sslater@epsa.org no later than the close of business on 
Wednesday, April 4th.  Please contact Samantha Slater at EPSA for further 
information.

In addition to the ISO derating its own available transmission capacity 
(exporting) at the California Oregon Border (so that people can't buy 
transmission from the ISO to export power) the ISO is now threatening to cut 
our exports from California using transmission rights that we have purchased 
from a muni that is not part of the ISO's grid.

AES Completes Acquisition of IPALCO

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) announced that it has completed its=20
acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises, the Indianapolis, Ind.-based utility wit=
h=20
3,000 MW of generation and 433,000 customers in and around Indianapolis.=20
IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange =
of=20
shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be=20
exchanged for 0.463 shares of AES common stock. IPALCO common stock was=20
suspended from trading at the close of the market on March 27. =20

Analysis: The purchase of IPALCO, an established and respected utility in t=
he=20
Midwest, will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an=
d=20
further the company's aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid=
e=20
of its business. AES already owns CILCORP, an energy services company whose=
=20
largest subsidiary, CILCO, serves portions of Illinois and Missouri. (Note=
=20
that pursuant to an SEC order, AES will restructure and/or sell its ownersh=
ip=20
interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an=
=20
exempt holding company under PUHCA). Thus, through the purchase of IPALCO,=
=20
AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has=20
established. In addition, from this purchase we now know that AES, along wi=
th=20
being a global player, intends to remain dominant throughout the United=20
States as well. Further, the acquisition represents a rather bright=20
development for AES, considering that the company has recently encountered=
=20
some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California.=20

First, let's examine the value of AES' acquisition of IPALCO. Certainly, th=
e=20
3,000 MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima=
ry=20
draw, but from comments made by Dennis Bakke, AES president and CEO, the=20
company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana (an=
d=20
the Midwest as a whole). IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the=20
aggressive management of AES; the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as=20
Indianapolis Power & Light will now stand a much better chance for global=
=20
development and expansion.=20

As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made, the company secure=
s=20
a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but=
=20
fewer hard assets. With its strong generation portfolio, to which the IPALC=
O=20
purchase only adds, AES can further guarantee to potential customers a=20
reliable power supply. AES is one of the largest generation companies in th=
e=20
world, having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions=
.=20
The company's generating assets include interests in 134 facilities totalin=
g=20
over 48 gigawatts of capacity. By comparison, Calpine has approximately=20
36,700 MW, Dynegy has a net ownership of 12,497 MW, and Reliant has about=
=20
27,000 MW. In addition, AES' electricity distribution network has over=20
920,000 km of conductor and associated rights of way, and sells over 126,00=
0=20
GWh per year to over 17 million end-user customers. =20

AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an=20
aggressive growth strategy over the past year. Recent milestones for the=20
company are too many to list here. However, highlights include acquiring a=
=20
controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas; acquiring 100-percent=20
interest in Tractebel Power; purchasing 70-percent interest in the Mohave=
=20
Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; and purchasing GeoUtilities, Inc., an=
=20
Internet-based superstore for energy and telecom services. Just since the=
=20
start of 2001, AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy=
=20
assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo=20
Electron Corporation of Waltham, Mass., for $195 million, and announced new=
=20
generation development projects in Texas and California. AES also has=20
continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a 140-MW=20
oil-fired co-generation facility in Italy, the acquisition of a 290-MW=20
barge-mounted natural-gas fired generating business in Nigeria, and the=20
purchase of additional ownership interest in a 1,000-MW hydro plant in=20
Argentina. =20

As I've said in the past, AES is a company to watch. Even when acquisitions=
=20
that AES is making seem rather small, they must be taken within the context=
=20
of the portfolio that AES is building. Whether it's generation, retail=20
marketing, telecom, or selling electricity over the Internet, AES has a=20
foothold in many different areas. AES is a major player that can offer the=
=20
full package to a customer, which may in the end be its strongest advantage=
.=20
The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses, whic=
h=20
are all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delive=
ry=20
services and retail energy marketing. However, it is important to recognize=
=20
that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the=20
capability to market its commodity products through its marketing=20
subsidiaries.=20

However, although AES has had a fairly successful year, the company has hit=
=20
some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way, all of which=
=20
were related to the California market. AES has established several tolling=
=20
agreements with Williams Corp. for the power plants that AES owns in=20
California. Under the tolling agreements, AES essentially rents its plants =
to=20
Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity, which it then c=
an=20
sell on the wholesale market. In other words, Williams had a contract to=20
market all of the power generated by AES' California plants. In hindsight,=
=20
AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen=
ts=20
with Williams in California. Although AES did well last year, with net inco=
me=20
rising 181 percent to $641 million, the company reportedly lost $11 million=
=20
on the lucrative California market. Meanwhile, Williams (NYSE: WMB) reporte=
d=20
unaudited 2000 income from continuing operations of $873.2 million, or $1.9=
5=20
per share on a diluted basis, versus $178 million, or 40 cents per share on=
 a=20
restated basis, for 1999. AES also took a hit when it had to pay air=20
pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio=
ns=20
to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down. =20

Further, AES (along with other companies) continues to fall under the inten=
se=20
scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed "unjust and=20
unreasonable" for power generated at AES-owned plants. FERC's investigation=
=20
centers on the unavailability of certain so-called "must run" generating=20
plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland, a subsidiar=
y=20
of AES. A "must run" plant is a generating facility that the California ISO=
=20
can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the=20
reliability of the California transmission network. Several weeks ago, FERC=
=20
announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t=
he=20
actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES.  =20

On March 14, FERC gave the two companies 20 days to explain why they should=
=20
not refund $10.86 million to California utilities. Further, FERC said that=
=20
"Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages" of two AES-owne=
d=20
plants last April and May. "Williams received more revenues as a result of=
=20
the respective outages," the commission said. AES responded to the charges =
by=20
saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not=
=20
share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants. According to =
a=20
report in The Washington Post, AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa=
id=20
that as long as the plants are in operating condition, Williams decides whe=
n=20
they will run and what it will charge for their power. =20

As a result of the unavailability of the two "must run" AES plants, the=20
state's ISO had to obtain power from other plants, also owned by AES, where=
=20
the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger=20
profits.  The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and=20
Williams refused to make the two "must run" plants available "for reasons=
=20
that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance" of=
=20
the plant. =20

Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale=20
market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the=20
state's market. Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to=20
participate in the California market, it may be a smart move for the compan=
y=20
to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States (suc=
h=20
as the Midwest). Yet, how AES' acquisition of IPALCO will impact the=20
company's bottom line remains to be seen. Standard & Poor's (S&P) is=20
reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being, and is=20
keeping AES on CreditWatch. AES' double-'B' corporate credit, single-'B'-pl=
us=20
rating on subordinated debt, and single-'B' rating on the company's trust=
=20
preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information=
=20
about the acquisition of IPALCO. Also, S=02?lowered its corporate credit ra=
tings=20
on IPALCO to triple-'B' from single-'A'-plus, and IPALCO's subsidiary,=20
Indianapolis Power & Light Co. (IPL), to triple-'B' from double-'A'-minus,=
=20
and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative. S=02?ex=
pects=20
to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks. =20

On March 27, AES shares closed at about $47.75. As of mid-morning on March=
=20
28, AES shares were priced at about $50.00. Over the last few days, AES=20
shares have increased by about 5 percent and have closely tracked the Dow=

California, and until the FERC makes a final determination on whether rates 
are just and reasonable, to subject all sales to a cost-based refund

In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, 
March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is 
designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in 
real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the 
December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the 
ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund 
potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification 
unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its 
transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely 
insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order 
is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the 
Commission rules.

Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary:

I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH 
soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any 
other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.  Is that correct? 
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

I talked to Brian Whalen today.  He is trying to get an interconnection 
agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow.  Sierra/Nevada have abandoned 
their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement 
they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection 
agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders.  Brian was very apologetic 
about taking so long.  

He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they 
send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month.

He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become 
Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement).  I said I didn't know but 
that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate 
people got them.  

Lysa- when I get these reports please forward them to Don.

Subject: Revised RCR for PGE RFP:  $5,000


Mary,  I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along 
the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to 
PGE in Docket No. ER99-364-000.  I agree that the current situation is quite 
similar to that.  thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has 
already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally 
thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.  
Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since 
that would delay the filing.  I would therefore revise my RCR projection to 
$5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it.  (I would 
let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.)

FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing.  As before, 
however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by 
the RFP.  I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a 
legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE 
subject to FERC approval.  Since time is of the essence, let me know when to 
begin, and we'll jump on it right away.  Ron

>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 03/13/01 12:48PM >>>
Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI
wants to submit an offer on.  PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for
50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's
system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.  Offers are due by March 28 and
PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept .

I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under
the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.  I have also told him that
EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the
regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any
contract in PGE's favor.  I would recommend the former.  Ron - would you
tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,
in the event PGE accepts our offer?  Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for
this FERC filing.  Is that okay?

Mary's last point about the non-ISO and PX markets is a key point.  We need 
to keep any FERC action contained to those markets.

Mary - pls submit an RCR.

		 Subject: Emergency Motion of City of San Diego

Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered."
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets.

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan

We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have).  
We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same.  Also, you'd need to send a 
letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement.  I'll send you the 
letter we sent.  I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as 
well as the Day-ahead and Day-of.  Call me ASAP 503-464-8862.  Thanks.

Subject: CAISO Notice:  SCE's  Letter Notification and ISO Response


Market notice:

On January 24, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received by fax a letter
from John R. Fielder, Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Policy Affairs
at Southern California Edison (SCE).  Mr. Fielder stated that SCE was
providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff "that
SCE will not be performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariff
because it will not be paying every invoice due to Uncontrollable Forces, as
defined in the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Fielder stated that the Uncontrollable
Forces were "regulations and restrictions imposed by governmental
authorities, including without limitation, the CPUC's order of January 4,
2001, that failed to authroize SCE to obtain, and restricted SCE from
obtaining sufficient funds to enable SCE to meet its payment obligations."
Mr. Fielder further stated that, "[b]ecause SCE's action is due to
Uncontrollable Forces, the ISO should not attempt to exercise any remedies
against SCE for non-performance and SCE will hold the ISO responsible for
the consequences of the ISO exercising any such remedies."  Finally, Mr.
Fielder stated that SCE was using its best efforts to mitigate the effects
of the regulations and restrictions and would continue to do so.  The CEO of
the California ISO has written to Mr. Fielder stating that it is studying
the position taken in Mr. Fielder's letter and that for the moment it
neither accepts nor rejects the position.  The purpose of this market notice
is to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
SCE based on SCE's failure to pay ISO invoices.

Subject: Questions you requested

Joshua:  

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so 
believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional 
materials, just let me know.



In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of 
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with 
the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California 
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the 
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets 
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that 
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.  
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder" 
management board was created that represented a wide range of market 
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.  
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as 
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an 
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state 
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that 
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from 
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California 
Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger western 
regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are 
reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.  
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power crunch 
comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during times of 
real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first 
and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions involving 
out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial interests 
sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of robust, 
competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions practically 
guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

FERC Won't Reconsider PG&E Reorg. Plan
By Patrick Connole

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday 
upheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its 
unregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by 
California state officials and by other companies.

The utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a 
way to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to 
bankruptcy by the California power crisis.

PG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest 
utilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale 
prices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the 
companies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.

On Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to-1 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny 
requests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.

FERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than 
$20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in 
the energy-starved state.

PG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated 
companies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger 
Generating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma 
Generating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek 
Generating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power, 
Pittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.

``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E 
Corp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order. 
``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit 
rating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the 
subsidiaries.''

FERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the 
corporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.

``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the 
possibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from 
selling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in 
California,'' the FERC order said.

The majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.

``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit 
ratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will 
finance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the 
order said.

FERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate 
reorganization.

Commissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled 
by FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously 
objected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate 
reorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.

The NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.

California lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide 
immediate and long-term relief to both utilities.

FERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate 
electricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently 
vacant.

We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for 
LV Cogen.  Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the 
queue.  We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't 
detail here).  Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it 
resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue.  At this time, we 
are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if 
we can't get the transmission service.  It is my understanding that we have 
exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue.  I 
would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve 
this issue.  However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing 
due to the pending merger.

Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all 
negotiating opportunities and that we can't file anything against Sierra.

Subject: ISO problems

At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.

Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the 
Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of 
January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available 
transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this 
caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about 
$50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.  
This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity 
is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder 
what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take 
similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if 
there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like "economic" 
force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a 
Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to 
get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are 
more important than the NW's. 

Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis 
using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO 
advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.  
We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses 
transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our 
deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 
MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if 
exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to 
cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't 
thought of.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862.

Subject: Electronic Copy of Complaint Against PX


I've attached an electronic copy of the complaint, which has been filed 
within the past hour.  Hard copies that also include the cover letter, Fed. 
Reg. notice, and Appendix for service list are being mailed to all persons on 
FERC's service list in EL00-95-000 (the San Diego complaint proceeding).

Thanks to all who contributed to this project; it was truly a group effort.  
And special thanks to the nine companies that agree to join as signatories.

For those companies that did not join in, we encourage you to intervene ASAP 
in support of the complaint, including the request for an immediate 
suspension of the chargeback before the next round of chargeback invoices 
come due (which we believe could be as early as Feb. 15).  Since we are 
asking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than Feb. 14, your immediate 
intervention would be very helpful.

Thanks again.  Ron

On Feb. 6, 2001, Mirant Delta, LLC and Mirant Potrero, LLC filed a complaint 
against the Cal ISO in Docket No. EL01-35-000, which has been attached.  In 
the complaint, Mirant alleges that the ISO is violating the Federal Power Act 
and prior FERC orders through (1) waiving the applicable credit requirements 
for the IOUs prior to FERC approval (particularly in light of the ISO's 
inability to pay suppliers for energy provided); (2) failing to pursue all 
available remedies against defaulting parties; and (3) seating a 
non-independent governance board.

The relief sought by Mirant is as follows:  (1) that it be required to sell 
wholesale power only on commercially reasonable terms that provide for 
adequate assurances of payment; (2) that FERC order the ISO not to change its 
rates unilaterally in violation of the Filed Rate Doctrine; and (3) that FERC 
require the ISO adhere to the specific provisions of its tariff and FERC 
orders.

Mirant has requested fast track processing for this complaint.  It appears 
that FERC is granting this request; FERC noticed the complaint on Feb. 8, and 
established Feb. 26 as the due date for interventions/protests and answers.

Mary:

Dave Corey, PacifiCorp's transmission customer rep will call Lester Rawson on 
Tuesday.  (He's on jury duty Monday and not in now.)

If that is too long, ask Lester to call Jack Stamper at 503-813-5737.

Apparently, the path previously listed should not have been listed because 
PacifiCorp lacks a continuous electrical connection between the two points.  
Somewhere around Walla Walla, BPA's system must be used to get from one part 
of PacifiCorp's system to the other.  Thus, we had to dissect the contract 
path into two PacifiCorp segments--and your people may need to purchase a BPA 
segment also.

Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut 
transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have 
the same effect as cutting transmission to the north.  

Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue 
this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to 
Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be 
helpful?

>From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has 
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power 
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power 
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from 
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission 
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get 
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO 
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was 
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to 
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get 
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more 
difficult for him to balance his budget.  

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there 
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying 
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out 
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's 
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that 
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and 
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't 
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't 
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

The available transmision capacity (ATC) "derate" did occur and has occured 
everydaysince about the 24th.  This fact was verified to me by our ISO 
customer contact on Friday.  Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the 
ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this 
information is verifiable with the ISO.  Our customer contact didn't know 
exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more 
with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.  The 
reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.  The 
line was again rated at zero today.  I have been pursuing the following 
approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.  I've talked to 
Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.  Eric believes he can get 
the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade 
press.  So check the trade press tomorrow.

I agree with Craig ... we need to be really, really careful about the earth 
orbit issues identified below.   We shouldn't talk about the derating issue 
unless we can:   (1) confirm the derating occurred and document it; (2) tie 
the derating directly to action by the new board (i.e., determine that it 
wasn't due to maintenance or some other physical occurence); (3) show a 
direct impact on PNW prices that can't be easily explained in another way; 
and (4) show a continuing pattern (in contrast to an isolated event).

Subject: RE: Questions you requested



 This excellent material, and very important, but it's pretty
esoteric.  If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins, use
Mary's stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB.   Assuming
it's true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission
route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power, and that this raised the
market price in the NW by about $50-75 per megawatt-hour, and that this is
costing the NW $2-5 million per day (at least for the period that Mary
looked at), that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit.  If we can
establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Davis's handpicked
ISO board, the NW Senators will escape Earth's gravitational pull.  For that
very reason, we have to be able to back up anything we say, and we need to
anticipate any defenses the ISO may have.  But if you want NW elected
officials to quit being so polite toward Davis, that will do it.

Subject: Questions you requested


Joshua:

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC
so believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional
materials, just let me know.
(See attached file: Ron Wyden Qs for Steve Kean.doc)


In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing
with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder"
management board was created that represented a wide range of market
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the
California Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger
western regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs
are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power
crunch comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during
times of real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to
shoot first and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions
involving out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial
interests sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of
robust, competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions
practically guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

Subject: TIGR - Changes to Tariff Integration Group Meeting Schedule





Greetings,?members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff  Integration Group.
?
As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on  March 23 may 
recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work  process be 
restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near  term we 
should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional  work 
efforts once the critical path items have been more fully  developed.
?
In response to these suggestions, we have substantially  revised the RTO West 
meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the  entire month of 
April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO  West Stage 2 
Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link  below:
?
http://208.55.67.64/Stage2Index.htm
?
The specific effect this near-term re-focusing will have on the Tariff  
Integration Group is that?tariff work will be suspended for a time while  
other work takes?first priority.? The Tariff Integration Group  meetings 
previously scheduled for April 4 and April?18 have been  canceled.? The March 
30 conference call that was set up specifically to  discuss ADR will be held 
as planned, however.? If you would like to join  that conference call, it 
will be on Friday, March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30  p.m. Pacific Time.??The 
dial-in will be 503-813-5808, passcode  964949.
?
I apologize if these changes cause you any inconvenience.?  We?appreciate the 
valuable contributions and dedication you have already  brought to this 
process, and we look forward to getting back to?work with  all of you as soon 
as some of the other critical path items have gotten more  fully developed.
?
Thank you very much!
?
- Sarah?

Joshua:    Your boss did a great job yesterday and I thought the exchange 
between Steve Kean and he was very effective.  We would love to work with you 
and would be happy to draft some legislative language for your consideration 
which would address the issue.  Plus, I can be helpful in gaining bipartisan 
support for the provision.  Have you discussed this with Valerie at all?  
Since Tim Beldon in our Oregon office has met with Ronnie Euchas on 
disclosure, I want to include him on the drafting.  Thus, it might take me a 
day or two longer to get something to you.  Hopefully, I can have something 
drafted by Monday and I'll call you to see if I can come up and meet with you 
to discuss the draft lanuage, strategy, next steps, etc.  Thanks.

Cynthia,

Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
in
following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
legislation.

Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
this.

- Joshua

On 10/27/00, FERC issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting 
long term transmission.  (Morgan Stanley v. Ill. Powerand Tenaska Power v. 
SPP).  In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) 
transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the 
entire request.  Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial 
service differently.  In these orders FERC holds:

A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in 
response to a long term request.  Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only 
obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service 
could be provided.  Examples:
 -- Customer requests 300 MW long term transmission service for one year.  TP 
replies that it can offer 200 MW for the entire year.
 -- Customer requests 2 year service for 300 MW.  TP replies that it can 
offer 300 MW for one year.
 -- Customer requests 300 MW for one year.  TP can only provide 300 MW for 
summer months.  TP is NOT obligated to provide customer the 3 months  
service.  Furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 MW for 
others is NOT a valid long term request.  What Customer is then doing is  
really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short 
term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.

While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in 
response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it 
thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is 
available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes.

SBX 33 passed off of the Senate floor on a vote of 24-14.  The vote was
along straight party lines.  The following are some of the key comments
made during the debate.  Senators are identified by party affiliation.
The Senate did not take up SBX 6.

Sen. Morrow (R):  This bill is like a partial birth abortion  - we never
gave the market a chance to work right.  It=01,s the generators who are
getting the raw deal.

Sen. McClintock (R):  Of the all the choices the Administration could
choose to resolve this crisis, they are choosing two of the worst, to
raise rates and to ensure blackouts.  LADWP is the biggest price gouger
of them all so there is no reason to believe a public power authority
will be better.  I would support a public power authority only to build
new generation.

Sen. Kuehl (D) :  The free market works only if we can say =01&no=018 to th=
e
product =01) can=01,t say no to energy.  Acquiring transmission lines gives
the state control over the provision of energy.

Sen. Scott (D) :  Reliant is spending $300 million to name a dome after
itself.  My district has 3 MUD=01,s who rejected deregulation and the
ratepayers are happy.

Sen. Bowen (D) The only question is how much of a premium we=01,ll have to
pay for bureaucracy to run the system.  Would you prefer to be gouged by
unbridled market power and name stadiums in faraway places or have
checks and balances?

Sen. Haynes (R):  If we don=01,t get more power, we=01,re just rearranging =
the
deck chairs on the Titanic.  Regulatory burdens prevent companies from
building in CA.  Do we want to use public dollars or private dollars to
build generation.  More government won=01,t get rid of the shortage while
letting more entrepreneurial money in will create a buyers market.

Sen. Peace (D):  The Houston cartel with their protectors at FERC are in
a wholesale attack on CA ratepayers.  Removing price caps, fixing the
ISO and PX and encouraging more retail competition won=01,t fix the
wholesale market.  Our constituents are threatened because FERC won=01,t do
its job.  Those who didn=01,t play by the rules are responsible for this.
Reliant insists that CA indemnify them from lawsuits =01) these people know
they were charging illegal rates and they would lose lawsuits.  These
bills are the only choice the kidnapers have given us.  Vote for it or
raise the lone star flag over the Capitol.

Sen Alarcon (D):  When I was on the L.A. City Council some of these same
private companies wanted to buy LADWP.  Their goal is to eliminate all
public power.

Sen Burton (D):  If we have our own peaker power then Reliant and Enron
would gladly sell us the rest of our power needs.  They are robber
barons and we have no sympathy for them

Air Liquide et al v. PSE 

        Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 

        This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of 
a "soft
        cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers. 

        On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint 
answer on
        the rate cap mechanism. 

        On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power 
rates
        paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A
        short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power 
costs
        if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. 

        The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the 
level of the
        temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and 
the
        PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place 
pending
        further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48. 

        Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, 
Air Liquide
        America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and
        Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., 
King
        County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview,
        Qwest and MCI WorldCo

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory 
and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as 
follows:

Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, 
it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there 
are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized 
drafts in advance of filing.
RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not 
involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.
On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard 
Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.

FYI

DJ FERC Affirms It Lacks Jurisdiction In Pwr Facility Sales
Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.



WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Wednesday reaffirmed its policy finding that it lacks jurisdiction over 
generation facility transfers.

     The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional 
asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view 
generation assets as jurisdictional.

     FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context 
of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the 
generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that 
produce the power.

     With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in 
the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been 
questioned by consumer interests and others.

     Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power 
Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its 
view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission 
facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.

     At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and 
FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility 
operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.

     The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power 
that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and 
promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.

     "There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale 
of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to 
our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself," 
FERC said.

     "Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there 
is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a 
contrary conclusion," FERC said, denying the petition.

     FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring

generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility 
regulators.
