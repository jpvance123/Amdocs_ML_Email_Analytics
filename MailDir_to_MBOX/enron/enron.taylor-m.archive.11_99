Mark, I understand that for certain short term Canadian physical deals 
completed between ENA and Enron Canada through the facilities of EnronOnline, 
ENA and Enron Canada have agreed to transact these deals as physical deals 
but book them as financial deals.  I was asked to prepare an agreement to be 
entered into between ENA and Enron Canada to reflect this agreement.  I 
attach a copy for your review and comment.  Please call me to let me know if 
you have any comments at your earliest convenience, as I understand that 
there is some urgency in getting this agreement in place.

Thanks

Greg Johnston (403-974-6745)

Justin, never got the fax could you resend it . Attached is our current 
checklist of legal issues that we are incorporating into our timeline. 



 Anyway if  may one more question.

 What  happens if you want to include a special condition in a 
"Confirmation". Let me give an example a Goods and Services Tax will be 
introduced  Australia in July 2000. We are a putting some wording in 
confirmations as to what will happen if the published electricity index is 
produced inclusive of GST. Clearly such a of a general  provision could 
included in a revised version of the GTCs. But what happens if there is a 
Master Agreement in place? Do you have to amendment to it before you can 
trade? 

On a more general level the more I see the more apparent it is that we should 
be relying heavily on legal work already been done and merely vet it for 
application to Australian laws.   Let me give an example. One area we have 
identified requires work is that of establishing that EnronOnline complies 
with requirements of our  Evidence Act. We are going have to establish to 
potential counterparties that the system  can provide sufficient certainty as 
the terms of a trade.  There must be evidence admissible in court  that  a 
trade actually took place and what  version of the GTCs was were linked to a 
particular product at a time.  For us to start looking at these issues from 
scratch will be expensive and time consuming assuming we had a detailed 
knowledge of the operation of the system. What I like to do arrange a time to 
talk through your process. Are you free if I call you 10 am Thursday  ?

One more update:

I tried to change the departure date, but the flights are all sold out on
Saturday and Sunday (they would have changed them free of charge).  I have
included a map of the area and the Airline has told me that they are
planning now on resuming flights to St Thomas as of 9pm tonight.  They also
just told me that since we are pre-confirmed customers on the San Juan to St
Thomas we will not get bumped off the flight to accommodate previously
cancelled customers - especially in the middle of an active trip.  That is
good news.

Looks full steam ahead.  Bruce - just a tactical question for you - do you
want to move to St John on Saturday if there are not a lot of penalties to
do so?  Could be fun to see the other island.

 I spoke with the Hotel in St Thomas - all systems go for now - they
seemed totally unfazed by the entire thing.  They have the reservation and
no problem.

 The Airline has cancelled all flights from San Juan to St Thomas for
today.  They did not have an outlook at this time for tomorrow.  They
suggested we check in as early as possible tomorrow so that we keep our
confirmed seat assignment from San Juan to St Thomas in case there are a lot
of stranded people trying to get there as well.

 Does anyone have a projection on the storm's movement by tomorrow
morning?  I feel really dumb - I don't even know which island on the map St
Thomas is. (see the attached pictures)

 If the flight from San Juan to St Thomas is cancelled, we will be
stranded there and have to take a flight out at a later time and need to get
a hotel in San Juan.  I have not yet asked them to change our departure date
as a pre-caution - that is next, but I think that causes problems with the
air fare.

 Here are some pictures I found on CNN.com.

The first time that you log into the web site you will see this message 
regarding certificates.  If you were to select continue than you should see 
an option to "accept forever" than you would not see this anymore.  
Nonetheless, this is a completely normal message from Netscape.

Rob,

The following is an update on the ongoing situations with some of the 
Canadian counterparties that have recently changed their corporate 
structures.  Clearly there are some issues that should be discussed regarding 
the approach Enron should take moving forward.  On some issues, we are at a 
point that decisions need to be made on whether or not to begin exercising 
our contractual rights.  Other issues remain to be resolved within Credit, 
and I expect these to be resolved within the next week.

Please call me to discuss any questions you might have with the following. 

1) Dominion Energy Inc. acquired Remington Energy Ltd. in April 1999.  
Remington operates as a wholly owned subsidiary under Dominion Energy Inc. 
and has a Master Physical under which its deals have been confirmed.  It has 
failed on each of the financial MAC covenants in the contract.  Repeated 
efforts have been made to obtain a parent guaranty from Dominion including 
conversations that have taken place with both commercial and credit 
contacts.  Nonetheless, the counterparty to date has been unresponsive to 
guaranty inquiries.  In the past few weeks, repeated phone calls to our 
Dominion contacts have not been returned.  Current mark-to-market exposure 
for Remington is approximately $9MM USD.  

2) Marathon Canada Ltd., a wholly owned sub of Marathon Oil Company (BBB-), 
acquired Tarragon  Oil and Gas Ltd. in August 1998.  Marathon Canada Ltd. is 
a private company and requested a confidentiality agreement prior to its 
providing financial statements.  Enron delivered the CA in July 1999 and 
Marathon provided unaudited financials November 4.  Tarragon has a Master 
Physical in place and has MACd on its covenants as a result of not providing 
financial statements.  The financial statements provided need to be discussed 
in further detail with the counterparty.  A request for parent guaranty from 
Marathon Oil Company may be the final option prior to calling for 
collateral.  Total exposure to the combined entity is $13.5MM USD.  

3) Talisman Energy Inc. acquired both Rigel Oil and Gas Ltd. and Highridge 
Exploration Ltd.  We have transactions confirmed under a Master Swap and a 
Master Physical with Highridge,  a Master Physical and a Master Swap with 
Talisman, and a Master Physical with Rigel.  Talisman has agreed to assign 
all outstanding deals to the existing master contracts we have in place with 
Talisman Energy Inc.  As soon as possible, we need legal to draft paper to 
Talisman moving the outstanding deals under the Rigel and Highridge contracts 
to the Talisman contracts.  In the same letter, Talisman has agreed to 
terminate the Rigel and Highridge contracts.  In return, credit has agreed to 
review the collateral thresholds and credit terms in the existing Talisman 
contracts.  Talisman has its third quarter financials available this Friday.  
By the end of next week we should be able to send the letter to Talisman with 
amendments, transaction transfers, and Rigel/Highridge contract 
terminations.  Combined exposure for the entities is approximately $30MM USD.

4) Renaissance Energy Ltd. amalgamated Pinnacle Resources Ltd.  We have one 
deal on the books, but no contracts with Renaissance. We have a long term 
deal confirmed under a Master Swap and a long term deal confirmed under a 
Master Physical with Pinnacle.  Pinnacle does not want to move the existing 
Renaissance deal under the Pinnacle master agreement.  It appears as though 
Renaissance is finalizing a sale of assets that will include some Pinnacle 
properties.  If they sell the Pinnacle properties underlying our deals, they 
said they would probably assign the outstanding deals and contracts to the 
purchaser (presumably after obtaining Enron approval for such).  
Renaissance's current corporate structure automatically obligates Renaissance 
to the obligations of Pinnacle and the resulting exposure under the two 
contracts.   Combined exposure for these entities is $13MM USD.  A credit 
review on Renaissance will be conducted within the next week.

5)  Devon Energy Corporation acquired Northstar Energy Corporation in 
December 1998.  Northstar continues to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary, 
has an executed Master Physical, and it has MACd on each of its covenants.  
There is approximately $9.3MM USD mark to market exposure with Northstar.  
Northstar has had several counterparties request a parent guaranty, but has 
not offered any to date.  Devon offers limited financial information on its 
Canadian operations in its 10-K, but exclusive Northstar data is not 
provided.  We have sent Northstar our preferred form of guaranty, and they 
have been unresponsive to subsequent phone calls.

You obviously know far more than me....but I was just reading the following=
:

        THE LATE-SEASON storm has killed at least four people from Colombia
to Dutch St. Maarten in the northeast Caribbean.
       On Tuesday, two fishermen drowned off Colombia=0F's Caribbean penins=
ula,
and rains destroyed half of a coastal village, leaving 540 people homeless.
       One man died in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, after he fell of=
f
a ladder as he tried to board up windows. A man in St. Maarten died
Wednesday when the garden wall of his hillside home collapsed on him.
       The hurricane was unlikely to strike the mainland United States, sai=
d
meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. He
cautioned, however, that Lenny still could bring heavy surf capable of
eroding beaches in Florida.
       =0F"The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable
distances away,=0F" he said.

       In St. Croix, an unidentified tourist who ventured out of a hotel to
see the rising surf was carried away by waves and had to cling to a rock fo=
r
more than an hour before local divers rescued him, said Gov. Charles
Turnbull of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
       Even before the hurricane arrived, storm surges that whipped up
12-foot waves stripped sand from Anguilla=0F's famous beaches. The beaches,
which attract tourists who provide the British island=0F's biggest source o=
f
revenue, already had been damaged by Hurricane Jose last month.
       Nearly 100 tourists had to be evacuated from a flooded hotel to
another hotel on higher ground in Anguilla.

A SEEMINGLY BACKWARD STORM
       Hurricane Lenny is a late-season storm with a seemingly backward
trajectory from west to east that surprised even seasoned forecasters.
       Feeding off the warm Caribbean waters, Lenny=0F's winds strengthened=
 to
150 mph Wednesday, just 5 mph short of being a Category 5 hurricane, the
strongest hurricane rating. Category 5 hurricanes can cause catastrophic
damage. By Thursday morning, the storm had weakened to 135 mph.
 Advertisement

           In San Juan, a few motorists speeded down highways usually choke=
d
with traffic and tooted their horns with delight that the storm, which
zigzagged on a course that confounded meteorologists, had missed them. But
nearly 100,000 people remained without water or electricity Wednesday night=
.
       The eye of the storm was expected to pass close to the Dutch
territories of St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, Saba and the British island of
Anguilla.
       Anguilla was drenched by 4 to 6 inches of rain in four hours
Wednesday afternoon, and its beaches were eroded by sea swells of up to 12
feet throughout the day.
       The storm=0F's first winds cut power and telephone service to many h=
omes
in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The hurricane ripped up trees and
unleashed a steady rain that flooded large areas.
       The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent medical teams to
the Virgin Islands ahead of the storm. The agency=0F's director, James Lee
Witt, told reporters that damage assessors would fly in today.
       He said that while the hurricane damaged roofs, including that of th=
e
national armory, he did not expect widespread damage because FEMA had helpe=
d
the government institute new hurricane building codes after Hurricane
Marilyn devastated the islands in 1995.
       The territory has a $1 billion debt and still owes $8 million for
federal disaster loans from Hurricane Marilyn and Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

RUINOUS WAVES
       Waves smashed over the 8-foot sea wall at Frederiksted, the
second-largest town on the island, tearing away the wooden pier that was th=
e
fish market and a small part of the concrete pier where cruise ships dock.
       In Christiansted, St. Croix=0F's main town, the boardwalk was submer=
ged,
and winds tore part of the roof off the newly renovated King Christian
Hotel.
       The storm beached and sunk boats from Aruba, off Venezuela=0F's coas=
t in
South America, to Grenada and St. Kitts.
       On St. Kitts=0F' concrete pier, a half dozen people suffered fractur=
es
and other injuries when they were hit by waves. Storm surges in Grenada
swept away four houses, washed away asphalt roads, damaged runway lights at
the airport and flooded roads and the business district.
       Turnbull said Wednesday he was waiting for President Clinton to
declare St. Croix a disaster area, making it eligible for federal emergency
funds.

Louise - thanks for forwarding.  Preliminary response as follows (I will need 
to follow up with Sanjev at Slaughter and May who is co-ordinating the 
European side):

1.  Regulation

We agree with the analysis. Securities laws will not be relevant.  Insurance 
is likey to be the main issue.  If it emerges from our legal review of the 
relevant countries that we can avoid the insurance point by making our 
contracts look like derivatives (swaps/options) that will determine whether 
the CFTC (commodity) regulations will be relevant.  For this reason, it makes 
sense to complete the survey before drafting the confirms (which in any event 
will be fairly simple). Note, though, that we will not be using ISDA 
documentation, since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated 
(described below) and using the GTCs approach will tie in more neatly with 
OnLine.  

Of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target 
jurisdiction.  SFA, for example, are taking an increased interest in the 
internet and have recently released a detailed questionnaire which we may 
need to complete before launch.

2.  The Product

>From my most recent discussions with Bryan, the product will be a simple 
Bankruptcy only, digital payout.  That is, if the reference entity goes 
bankrupt (probably as defined under the laws of its jurisdiction of 
incorporation - local counsel will need to draft in each case) the protection 
seller will pay the buyer a fixed, pre-agreed sum of money (not determined by 
reference to the value of a bond or anything else).

3.  Bankruptcy

Please see 2 above.  Also note that we are looking for a harder (more 
certain) definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain 
in each case.  Early warning type events will probably be out and court based 
or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in. In 
practice, this will make it harder for the buyer to claim than under the ISDA 
definition (for example) which is a far softer and more sensitive trigger.

4.  Confidentiality

Ken also raised this important point when we spoke yesterday.  There are 
issues of confidentiality which will be relevant.  While as a matter of UK 
regulation, a Chinese Wall/Restricted List procedure will not be required 
(since no securities will be involved), contractual duties of confidentiality 
will need to be considered.

The issue is perhaps more a commercial one - We will need to think carefully 
about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties 
will or might have on our business relationships with them.

I'll come back with a "legal game plan" once Bryan, Sanjev and I have got 
together.

Best regards

Paul

Subject: Enron OnLine/Credit Derivatives



Following up on our discussion yesterday, this is to summarize the issues and 
questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit 
derivatives through Enron OnLine:

1.  The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of 
three principal regulatory schemes - securities, commodities and insurance.  
If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to 
securities, there should not be any significant securities law issues.  With 
respect to the Commodity Exchange Act, if the derivatives are executed as 
swaps, they will need to satisfy the CFTC's swap exemption and, if executed 
as options, they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption.  With 
respect to insurance, there could be an issue as to whether the credit 
derivatives constitute insurance.  This determination as well will depend 
largely on how the derivatives are structured.  For example, how will payment 
amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually 
experienced  by a counterparty?

2.  As a result of the foregoing, it will be necessary to obtain more details 
regarding the structure of the proposed transactions.  Will they be swaps or 
options?  What will the precise terms be (and are there any draft forms of 
confirms that can be reviewed)?

3.  It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be 
defined.  This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit 
derivatives that include a variety of triggers (such as those based on 
defaults under loans, derivatives, securities or other instruments), because 
bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event.  However, in 
many jurisdictions, it is  possible for third parties to cause an involuntary 
bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be 
commenced and maintained for some period.  Presumably the definition that is 
used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be 
dismissed.  Also, the definition will need to take into account the 
possibility of non-US bankruptcy proceedings.

4.  We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the 
derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be 
published or disseminated to clients.  This goes to the issue of whether 
Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether 
that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis.

For example, it is possible that an entity whose "name" is included in the 
list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron 
improperly used confidential information that it received about that party 
through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit.  In 
addition, such "name" might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a 
price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating 
than was warranted.  That party might claim that, by publishing such price, 
Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it, to declare defaults or 
to demand collateral.  This obviously is not generally a problem with credit 
derivatives because they are done privately on a one-to-one basis.

Please call us if you have any questions or would like to discuss these or 
other issues further.  Best regards.

I will check if the USVI is part of the US for my purposes.  I get confused
regarding what is the US and what is part of the US imperial system.

Also, if we are a boat leaving US territory and then reentering.....will we
still not have to go through US customs?  I cannot have a customs
official looking up a computer and seeing that I have left the country and
thereby invalidating my green applications.  If USVI and BVI have a close
relationship
and they are not too fussed fine....but somehow I cannot see US immigration
not being fussed.

I do not want to spoil the holiday for you guys, and I know you are not keen
on sailing within the confines of USVI (even if I can get there and that is
another whole problem), so this is just a heads-up I may have to abandon
ship.

B


PS     Gregg - do you have the flight details...so I can see if I can change
to USVI?

I spoke with the Hotel in St Thomas - all systems go for now - they seemed
totally unfazed by the entire thing.  They have the reservation and no
problem.

The Airline has cancelled all flights from San Juan to St Thomas for today.
They did not have an outlook at this time for tomorrow.  They suggested we
check in as early as possible tomorrow so that we keep our confirmed seat
assignment from San Juan to St Thomas in case there are a lot of stranded
people trying to get there as well.

Does anyone have a projection on the storm's movement by tomorrow morning?
I feel really dumb - I don't even know which island on the map St Thomas is.
(see the attached pictures)

If the flight from San Juan to St Thomas is cancelled, we will be stranded
there and have to take a flight out at a later time and need to get a hotel
in San Juan.  I have not yet asked them to change our departure date as a
pre-caution - that is next, but I think that causes problems with the air
fare.

Here are some pictures I found on CNN.com.

I'm not too worried about this - the letter which Mark Taylor is preparing 
will state that whatever method we choose to use will supercede EOL - so if 
everything is set to GTC and the GTC flags are set to "read", that should be 
enough - unless someone is worried about the confirms.

Karen Lambert has indicated that we have Master Agreements between HPLC and 
ENA (physical) and between ENA and ECC (physical &financial).   We will need 
to populate the master agreements in EOL.  I need some direction relative to 
this to assure we sent it up correctly.  In addition, we will assign the 
short agreement you discussed a global id and populate this number in EOL for 
all desk to desk trades that are intra company.

Attached is a spreadsheet with the Trading Books and Products we plan to have 
set up for Mondays internal launch.



There is a list of the trading books with their associated company and duns 
ID (Bob I am missing the options book duns id's and the co's for 2 of the 
texas books).
There is a list of the products for launch, their status and their associated 
book. (Bob I need trading books matched to Canada products and TRCO/Z6 Basis).
Basically their are 3 companies for all these books - Enron North America 
Corp., Enron Canada Corp. and Houston Pipe Line Company (for texas trades).

Their is a Matrix of products and books which needs to be filled in for each 
books profile (Specifically see current transactions & Tax).
I will discuss the access for each US book with Jeff Shankman and Canada with 
Lavorato.

Bob will populate the internal transactions normally undertaken by each desk.

As agreed Credit will have to populate the headroom and tenor daily to test 
this functionality.

Mark will draft the letter stating that offline contractual framework will 
apply.

Jay should have the bridges set to manual booking by Thursday.

Bob is covering the booking of these post bridge monitor picking up the 
bridge failure.

David will cover tax and credit.

PCG will set up the trading books as customers with read only access prior to 
determining their profile. The books will be set to having read ETA's and 
GTC's.
This needs to be completed tomorrow as we need to test trading books as 
counterparties on the system.

Thanks,
Marcello

Edmund/Justin, I would appreciate your advice on a few points. 

 I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the  
Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password 
Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both 
have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting 
party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives 
through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron 
entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a 
Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties?
If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian 
financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master 
Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity 
Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see. 
However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I 
have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power 
contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established 
protocols for drafting GTCs? 
Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the 
documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted 
under English law there is an exclusion of "special damages".  In Australia 
and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be 
specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering 
that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely 
different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered 
and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?  
How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of 
contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the 
various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues 
relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law 
and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just 
regulatory compliance issues.


If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 9229 2310.

Re: Report by the President's Working Group on Financial markets
 on Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity
 Exchange Act


                    Attached is a memorandum from Sullivan & Cromwell
concerning the above subject.  A summary is also included at the end
of the text of this e-mail message.

                    The attached file is in Adobe Acrobat
format.  We believe most PCs will already have an Acrobat viewer
loaded; we can provide free copies if Acrobat is not already loaded,
and free copies can also be downloaded from the Adobe Acrobat web

SUMMARY

                    In order to resolve legal uncertainties regarding the 
status of
over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives under the Commodity Exchange Act (the 
"CEA"),
Congress requested the President's Working Group on Financial Markets ("PWG") 
to
report on, and make recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes 
with
respect to, such instruments.  On November 9, 1999, the PWG issued its 
report, entitled
Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act (the 
"Report"),
which proposes a number of substantial changes to the CEA and the regulatory 
structure
for a variety of OTC derivatives.  Subject to the enactment of the 
recommended amendments
to the CEA and regulations of the CFTC, the Report could substantially 
alleviate the legal
uncertainty that currently exists with respect to OTC derivatives, thereby 
facilitating
further growth and development in the markets for such instruments.

 It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling
to the USVI;
 since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I
wouldn't
 expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or
Puerto Rico.
 We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be an
exploratory
 trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat to the
USVI till
 Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's tons of
work getting
 all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to pick Bruce
up in St.
 John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large, busy
commercial
 port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruise
ships (not
 fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas to St. John.
We won't be
 there before noon on Monday.

 I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right
thing here!

 Subject:  Re: Lenny



 OK...guys the story is this:


 I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS in
extremely
 nasty conditions.  Basically, I was not able to get hold of a travel
permit.
 Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit and
Federal
 Plaza cannot step in.  I cannot drive to Vermont, because they only
do
 postal.  I think I would feel slightly better had I known the
outcome at the
 start of the day rather than at the end.

 Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether I
could
 goto the US Virgin Islands.  The first answer was "no", so I
persisted and
 the second answer was "yes; can I point you to the US in the US
Virgin
 Islands", so feeling very patronised but having achieved something
for my
 day at Federal Plaza I left.

 We now have 3 choices:

 1.    Go to US VI......I definitely cannot go to BVI
 2.    Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit
comes
 through (which it should because my lawyer)
 3.    Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes through

 G:  Please can you see about changing my flights to the US VI.  You
are
 better at dealing with airlines than I am.....pretty please!

Subject: Restricted List

As you know, insider dealing (dealing in listed securities when in possession 
of price-sensitive information concerning those securities or their issuer) 
is a criminal offence in the UK.  This is an issue in the case of credit 
derivatives which often have listed securities (normally bonds) as their 
reference asset. 

SFA require us to have in place an effective mechanism to ensure our staff do 
not commit this offence.  We have concluded that operating a Restricted List 
procedure in London is the least onerous option - the most likely alternative 
would be to create a Chinese Wall involving the physical separation of 
traders from other staff.  

The Restricted List procedure is attached for your review and comment.  As 
you will see, it is short, simple and self-explanatory.  In essence, it 
establishes a channel through which price-sensitive information flows from 
the various business heads in to our SFA Compliance function who will 
maintain the Restriced List.  Before deals involving listed securities can be 
executed, the trader will need to check whether the issuer of the subject 
securities is on the list.  This process is manageable in the case of credit 
derivatives because the deal flow in such transactions is never enormous.

I would like to introduce this procedure next week at the latest.  The 
business unit heads who are most likely to encounter price-sensitive 
information and to whom we propose introducing this procedure are:  

Eric Gadd
Ron Bertasi
Chris Waltenspuel
Paul Chivers
Joe Gold
Louise Kitchen
Richard Lewis

Please let me know if you have any comments on this or any questions.

Paul

Therefore, it would be available to all companies accessing our website,

Dave,

It is important to ensure that, to the best of our knowledge, Newsticker 
Information is accurately stated, current and consistent with other 
information on the website and in the GTCs, Long Descriptions, User Guide, 
etc.

Nonetheless, we will want to be able to rely on the Legal & Privacy 
Statement, since this contains an exclusion of liability for the timeliness 
and accuracy of information on the website (para 4) and an exclusion of any 
warranties as to the completeness and accuracy of information (para 3). 

A couple of questions:

Will Newsticker Information only be relevant and available to companies that 
are actually trading on-line? 
Where on the website will the "link" to Newsticker Information appear? {This 
is important for the purposes of the Legal & Privacy Statement}

linepack).

It breaks down the items by product grouping.

If we want to proceed with putting this kind of info. on the ticker, we would

Where are we with Colombia? 

I notice that customers from Australia, Aruba, Bermuda, Colombia, Israel, 
Japan, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela and South Africa have also been 
approached in the mail shot (!)

I've highlighted the countries that I would expect to be more appropriate to

Hey Mark

Good to see you again last Sunday and I hope the conference went well.

I dont want to be a pain, but I feel it only right and proper to flag an 
issue I have.

My travel authorisation has not yet come through.  They are supposed to take 
4 weeks, but it has been at least 8 so far.  The authorisation may come 
through any time now, but if it does not come through I cannot leave the US.  
It would be stupid to jeopardise my Green Card application after waiting so 
long.

Sorry about this, but if the worst comes to the worst I am sure you 3 guys 
will have a great time anyhow.

Mark,

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Frank

Mark:
What do you know about the apparent decision to attach GTCs when faxing out 
the confirms?  I believe it was the gas/power people who made that statement 
at our October mtg (you were out of town, as I recall).

I have not had any discussions with Mark Taylor on the point of attaching 
GTCs. I don't know why it has been determined to be appropriate to do the 
attachment. Please consult with Mark on this and let me know what you find 
out. Thanks.

Subject: EOL Confirmations

You will recall that we went to a meeting last month w/ the EOL people while 
you were out of town.  That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed 
to be done on the confirms.  Of course, there still hasn't been time to 
finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority 
got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by 
EOL.  But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm 
that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.  It seemed to us that perhaps you 
and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd 
reached some conclusion.  Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not 
require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer 
will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).  But we never had 
a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

By the way, it looks like the SK deal closing is on for next week, so I'll be 
leaving for Singapore on Monday.

Have you had a chance to review and finalize the templates for any of our EOL

Also, have any decisions been made on "GTC" attachment/no attachment?

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

 Yes - and boats.  I wasn't too worried until the last update which
indicates the
 storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there -
just barely
 east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will
resume its
 course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.
As of the
 middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the
Friday charter
 starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!

      It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with
traveling
 to the USVI;
      since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the
BVI I
 wouldn't
      expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland
or
 Puerto Rico.
      We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be
an
 exploratory
      trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat to
the
 USVI till
      Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's
tons of
 work getting
      all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to pick
Bruce
 up in St.
      John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large,
busy
 commercial
      port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the
cruise
 ships (not
      fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas to St.
John.
 We won't be
      there before noon on Monday.

      I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the
right
 thing here!

      OK...guys the story is this:


      I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS
in
 extremely
      nasty conditions.  Basically, I was not able to get hold of a
travel
 permit.
      Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel
permit and
 Federal
      Plaza cannot step in.  I cannot drive to Vermont, because they
only
 do
      postal.  I think I would feel slightly better had I known the
 outcome at the
      start of the day rather than at the end.

      Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of
whether I
 could
      goto the US Virgin Islands.  The first answer was "no", so I
 persisted and
      the second answer was "yes; can I point you to the US in the US
 Virgin
      Islands", so feeling very patronised but having achieved
something
 for my
      day at Federal Plaza I left.

      We now have 3 choices:

      1.    Go to US VI......I definitely cannot go to BVI
      2.    Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit
 comes
      through (which it should because my lawyer)
      3.    Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes through

      G:  Please can you see about changing my flights to the US VI.
You
 are
      better at dealing with airlines than I am.....pretty please!

Attached is a copy of a newsletter which we currently send out to customers. 
This is written internally and is currently distributed by fax.

I assume that as we are already distrubuting this information by fax, there 
should be no concerns about publishing on EnronOnline?

Note that the only portions we would put online are:

Weather
Gas Storage
Commentary

 I will check if the USVI is part of the US for my purposes.  I get
confused
 regarding what is the US and what is part of the US imperial system.

 Also, if we are a boat leaving US territory and then
reentering.....will we
 still not have to go through US customs?  I cannot have a customs
 official looking up a computer and seeing that I have left the
country and
 thereby invalidating my green applications.  If USVI and BVI have a
close
 relationship
 and they are not too fussed fine....but somehow I cannot see US
immigration
 not being fussed.

 I do not want to spoil the holiday for you guys, and I know you are
not keen
 on sailing within the confines of USVI (even if I can get there and
that is
 another whole problem), so this is just a heads-up I may have to
abandon
 ship.

 PS     Gregg - do you have the flight details...so I can see if I
can change

Just to confirm recent conversations:

1) At the current time, customers must accept the GTC for each new Product 
Type grouping (e.g. Belgian Gas Physical forward and Belgian Gas Physical 
Forward Option would each require acceptance of the same GTC).

2) We would like to keep the "deal roadblocks" to a minimum - e.g. we do not 
want to push customers into reviewing and accepting contracts more often than 
necessary.

3) We should change EOL so that when a GTC is accepted, all Product Types 
which reference that GTC will show that the GTC has been already accepted.


If anyone disagrees with the above, please let me know ASAP, otherwise I will 
discuss making the change with Jay.

Thanks,

Dave

Attached is a report released today by Securities and Exchange Commissioner 
Laura Unger that summarizes the findings from a series of on-line investing 
roundtables conducted earlier this year on on-line brokerage.  The report 
makes recommendations for ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry 
and for regulatory strategies she believes the Commission should consider.  

The findings and recommendations in the report focus on the issues of 
suitability, best execution, market data, systems
capacity, investor education, on-line discussion forums, privacy, and 
portals.  Commissioner Unger believes these are
among the key on-line issues facing investors and the industry today.

Unger said," The Internet is rapidly making on-line trading ubiquitous.  This 
report provides the Commission with a 
comprehensive examination of the critical issues to be addressed in the area 
of technology.  I think it may still be premature
for extensive rulemaking in this area, but the report will allow the 
Commission to focus upon and consider the most vital
issues concerning on-line brokerage." 

Please let us know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mark

I have just spoken with my lawyer.  Basically, USVI does not work.  I could
be easily "carded" on the way back in.  Apparently, it is well tried and
therefore well patrolled way of entry into the US.

We are going to try and get INS to speed the process, but basically I am in
a difficult position.  I no longer have the first job under which the first
application was submitted, so I cannot call and say I need the travel permit
for business reasons, and although my cheques have been cashed (I think) the
travel permit is delayed somewhere.  I have no news at all on the second
application.

Do you know of anyone that you may want to take along instead?  One or two
spots going....whichever is easiest to fill.

Justin, we are doing our legal review for the introduction of Enron Online to 
Australia next year. Would you be able to send me a set of the GTC for 
financial power trades in the UK. These will probably be the closest to the 
GTCs we will need to develop for  trading in electricity derivatives in 
Australia.

thanks for your help.

The Newsticker information will appear in both the House and Garden at the

Therefore, it would be available to all companies accessing our website,

Dave,

It is important to ensure that, to the best of our knowledge, Newsticker 
Information is accurately stated, current and consistent with other 
information on the website and in the GTCs, Long Descriptions, User Guide, 
etc.

Nonetheless, we will want to be able to rely on the Legal & Privacy 
Statement, since this contains an exclusion of liability for the timeliness 
and accuracy of information on the website (para 4) and an exclusion of any 
warranties as to the completeness and accuracy of information (para 3). 

A couple of questions:

Will Newsticker Information only be relevant and available to companies that 
are actually trading on-line? 
Where on the website will the "link" to Newsticker Information appear? {This 
is important for the purposes of the Legal & Privacy Statement}

Regards

Justin

Mark/Justin,

Obviously, we will need to have an appropriate examination of each data 
element, but do either of you foresee any complications with us providing 
information as per the attached via EnronOnline?

I am wondering particularly about any liability we may have in the event that 
the information which we provide is late or wrong.

Comments?

Thanks,

Attached is a European spreadsheet which shows possible information items 
which we could carry on our news ticker. (industry-specific stuff like 
linepack).

It breaks down the items by product grouping.

If we want to proceed with putting this kind of info. on the ticker, we would 
have to acquire legal approval and buy-in from the people who would be 
responsible for updating the information.

What do you think? Should we proceed with putting this kind of stuff on the 
site? Note that at the current time, it would have to appear in Garden.

The statement which Mark Taylor has/is referencing in his email to you is the

The Floating Price shall be the average of the index for each day in the

This should be used for all U.S. and Canadian financial products except

Subject: Counterparty agreement of confirmations

As we have discussed recently, we do not want to mention in confirmations for 
EOL transactions that the Counterparty has the right to alter the 
confirmation if they feel that the terms are not as agreed to by the 
parties.  Therefore, any mention of such behavior must be eliminated.  At the 
suggestion of Ron Nolte of the ENA IT group, it would be easiest if we could 
create a variable which would populate non-EOL deals with the language in 
question thus leaving EOL deals pristine.

Now the problem and the reason for this note:  Can we get consensus among the 
physical and financial lawyers to create a single set of verbiage for this 
variable?

I have attached what I believe to be the current language used by various 
templates to convey this matter.  





Thanks for your help.
