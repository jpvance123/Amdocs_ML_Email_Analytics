Folks:

John and Sireesha have just pushed to staging a bunch of enhancements / bug 
fixes / new features.  Included in them are:

 1.  Configurable Questionnaire
 2.  Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact 
lists)
 3.  User Statistics
 4.  Fix for the Issuing Entity
 5.  Auction security fix
 6.  Auction enhancements Part I 
 7.  Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain
 8.  The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to 
the user, but be happy that     this change ELIMINATES message brokers from 
this process)
 9.  Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc.

The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early 
next week.

I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect 
their comments / suggestions to John and I.  

The location of the test site is:  http://testfinweb1.ecomtest.enron.com.  
You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs 
and Passwords will not work!).  The admin ID and password (if you need to 
approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass).

We do PLAN on pushing all this stuff to PRODUCTION (barring any major bugs or 
mishaps) next FRIDAY - Dec 8th, 2000.

Look forward to your comments.  Thanks.  SR:-)

Wow !! Big brother is watching you... Thanks for your message. Actually, we
are quite impressed by how smooth the whole process is. But I think that my
colleague is talking to you at the moment... So far so good. We will see how
banks respond to the system. Many thanks indeed. With kind regards, JM

Hi Jean-Maurice,

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how your DealBench experience
is going.  I realize you may have some colleagues that are working with you
that may not have been in our demo in November.  I'm happy to spend some
time with them on the phone walking through the functionality within the
site.  Please feel free to call me at 713-345-3726.

I look forward to hearing from you to know how things are going.

Kind Regards,
Kristi DeMaiolo

Nick

Hope things are going well.

In the next few days we need to do two things.

1. Set the termination value of the existing options
2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.

Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
would like to talk to you to manage that.

We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
options, to ensure a good execution.

When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader
or myself (713-853-6750) a call, or point us in the right direction.

Thanks


Harry

We have completed our first year at DealBench.  It has been an exciting
and fruitful year when we launched our platform and evolved the
business.  I wanted to take a moment to appreciate your help in making
this a success.  You help was critical in getting our implementation
done in a reasonable time frame. Also, I appreciate your help in
teaching Tibco products to other outside consultants who worked with us.

Please feel free in sharing this email with your supervisor or others in
your company. Ecommerce implementations are hard business, and there is
always a time crunch and we appreciate your hard work and extra effort
in making this business implementation possible in a timely fashion.

Thanks


Harry Arora

Subject: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution
Importance: High


Event Sequence
? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues
? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes 
into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on 
the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem 
reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected
? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management 
subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:
? Restart the process that returns documents
? Move the documents off the deal
Solution:
? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the 
documents.
? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once 
started, it continued without further errors through several auction 
extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.

Cause
? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead 
returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear "hung". The 
Document to be served was the "deal agent logo", a special document type that 
is displayed at the top of the page.

Contributing Factors
? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, 
was not logging its status
? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly 
handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving 
the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   
? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running 
consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a 
problem source.

Fixes
? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system 
stability has been addressed
? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly 
test all possible failure scenarios.
? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process
? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in 
the event of error
? Increase monitoring on new log files
? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to 
identify further areas to improve system robustness

I will be attending the ski outing - I am not sure about my arrival and 
departure dates, but I did put tentative dates. Once I make my bookings I 
will update you on my final dates. I might stay an extra day, and will pick

Harry,

Today's live auction for Northern Border Pipeline's procurement of line pipe 
was quite a success!  Here are some highlights:



The auction lasted longer than the scheduled 15 minutes due to the automatic 
extension feature resulting from new Best Bids placed during the last two 
minutes of the auction.  Please note that we earned $52,500 for this auction 
and are on track to do another auction for NBPL on 1/30 for a $20,000 fee.

Regards, 
Ross

Subject: EOL Model with commodity markets

I am sending you the EOL model on Greg Piper's request. The model reflects 
accurately the traded volumes on EOL for 2000. Projections for 2001- 2011 
were built based on feedback from traders, investment bank and research 
institutes B2B forecasts and, common sense. These can be manipulated by 
changing the assumptions in the assumption sheet.

On the financial side the balance sheet and income statement have not been 
completely modelled since no specific deal structure has been defined. 
Though, they include the main revenue and expense components for EOL.

If you have any doubts with respect to the functionality of the model, please 
let me know. I am available to clarify them at your convenience.

Per our previous discussion, we would like to use DealBench for Project MI-3, 
which will appear on DealBench as Project Electra.  The site looks great, and 
we are excited to use it.

Thanks,

Brad

Kira-
I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange 
a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business 
strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss 
some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench 
subsidiary.

Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the 
needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants.   We are 
currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual 
datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and 
lease portfolios.  We have completed transactions with nominal value of over 
$4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago.   My initial thought is 
that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need 
for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas.

Hopefully we can find time to talk soon.
Take care,
Jeff

      Enron Metals Weekly Review

Good evening ...one and all . It hardly seems possible that  we are another 
week on  already such has been the pace of activity here . The  ebb and flow 
in the Ali  market both in the spreads and outright price have kept  our 
valiant dealers on their toes  as  seemingly the whole market  vies to  avail 
itself of our  pricing and liquidity services on-line ! .   Daily volumes 
have  continued to grow with  over 800  separate transactions being seen 
today! .  In fact volumes have risen by approximately  56% since December  
from a daily average  of 357 to a daily average of 557  for January .At the 
same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800 
trades a day to 1586 trades  since December.    Your efforts at getting  the  
registered customers who had not  completed an on line trade are beginning 
to  pay dividends  finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keep 
plugging away 
   
                




                            

 The graph  above illustrates the growth of our  average daily online 
transaction volumes  in relation to our regular transaction volume on a 
monthly basis  from July of 99 to date .


This week's daily  transaction volume  is another  record and   but for the 
blip on Monday  which put down to the  Mother's day in Africa  holiday  would 
have been sensational .  
 
  

   


We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks 
and have received little or no  reaction.  Consequently we shall ask again.  

Currently at the top of the list:  if  each of you could create a list of 
Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to 
attend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would be 
greatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for 
your benefit  .  Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals 
marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper 
attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 .  
Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations  well in  advance we 
will not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conference 
listing which will be circulated next week . Please add to it  if we have 
missed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have  our 
attention . 


For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of 
the Account Application Form.  The completion of this form for BOTH 
traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading 
with Enron Metals.



The lack of contributions for this review  from  any of you is  rather 
disappointing . We will continue to offer you  items that you may find of use 
. However the purpose of this  review is also  to incorporate content  from  
around the network of our  global field offices.    I know you are all very 
busy  making money for the cause . This  medium is  a useful platform to get 
your message over .   

For those of you not on the circulation lists  see the attached reports    

       The Metals Crammer report    


       The daily Options report 




 Whilst not exactly a feature  we thought it might be  a useful exercise in  
client relationship damage  limitation  to explain   what happens when a 
customer finds he cannot trade  on line .This has begun to occur more 
regularly as our volumes and activity increase.

 Customers are allocated  a credit line for EOL within the system based upon 
their  agreements.  This limit   is set daily   as a  default against the 
clients name . basis the AS400 's  net valuation of the client's position  . 
The amount of available  variation  credit  on the client's account  on EOL 
is  set as his  limit f or the next days trading . If the client should 
trigger this limit  during the next day's trading  the system will reject the 
trade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly   as the customer is 
not told why .  London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course 
do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected.  
The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system 
will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will 
have to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit in 
the system takes 48hrs .  This  is being  worked on but  we must remember 
that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC 
products on the system  are dealt with differently .  It also serves to 
highlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar 
range are not really suited to use EOL . Security  such as g/tees and cash 
are taken into account but can be missed  ,but forward profits are as it is 
net availability that is  used on the AS400.   This will all improve with the 
introduction of  a new bridge  between the Enron  risk system and the AS400  
in the very near future .  
 
 In the meantime  it will be up to you to  keep the peace and explain to your 
clients .  Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when they 
get locked out.   




Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive 
communication lines between our offices world-wide.  So, send us your 
thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news  etc.  We will look 
forward to hearing from you.  

Cheers, 

Alex and Molly

Here is McKinsey's work.  Broad overview only, with no specific analysis of 
grains, meats or softs.  Priorities here are grains, then meats, and separately 
softs given our existing exposure to this segment (53k Tons of Cocoa Physical,
Softs Brokerage Business in London).

Mark, I would encourage you to come down to 29 (assuming you are on 33) and
we will be more than happy to share all of our resources to get you up to speed
on our analysis and why we think these segments hold a lot of opportunity.

All,

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what 
functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging 
environment.  To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple 
process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team 
to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff 
prior to a release to production.  Please read the attached one page document 
that details the proposed process.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Zach

Just got off the phone with Kira.  She asked me what y'all do and I probably
butchered it, but she sounded interested (especially when I closed by saying 
it
would be a business services, fee-based revenue stream - from what I know in
the industry, Yahoo's all about that these days, trying to find complements to
its existing largely ad-driven model for which they are getting pummeled).  
She
said you should forward any information on to her at kira@yahoo-inc.com.  To
reach her by phone (I'd recommend handling initial contact through email and
then suggesting phone time, but your call), I don't have her direct number, 
but
called the main Yahoo corporate number 408-731-3300, then used the dial by 
name
directory - her last name is spelled Zahn, but you have to keep adding letters
from her first name (i went through K-I) before it will recognize it.  She and
her husband both were in law school with me and are very, very cool folks.  He
works at Silicon Valley Bank now.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

Heather,

Per our conversation, I am going to go ahead and process this order without 
the keyboards and/or mice.  The desktops, monitors and Palm Pilots come to 
roughly $34,000, which means I will need approval from a Sr. Director before 
I can place the order.  Can you have the appropriate person send me an email 
with his/her approval?  I will place the order as soon as I have that.  
Thanks!

Hi all,

I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.

Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer is for the year 2001.

We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2. 

You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our help-desk.

As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on the TIFF files during conversion to PDF. 

In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.

Thanks

Tobias Munk

Effective March 2, Harry Arora will be leaving DealBench to join Enron Americas' East Power Desk.  Harry and his team have done an excellent job of launching and growing the DealBench business.  We thank him for his contributions and wish him the best in his new role at Enron Americas.

Moving forward, the DealBench effort will be jointly headed by Suresh Raghavan and Jeff Bartlett, who will report to Greg Piper and continue the development and marketing of the platform for Enron and other customers.

Looks like EES has pretty much decided to use us for this RFQ (see the Word doc attached below) -- remember that we have a meeting scheduled with EES on Monday to discuss a "realtionship" and pricing.  Let's make sure before our meeting that we are all in agreement as to the pricing approach we will take with them.

Subject:	DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution
Importance:	High


Event Sequence
?	Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues
?	Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected
?	Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:
?	Restart the process that returns documents
?	Move the documents off the deal
Solution:
?	Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents.
?	The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.

Cause
?	Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear "hung". The Document to be served was the "deal agent logo", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page.

Contributing Factors
?	The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status
?	The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   
?	run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source.

Fixes
?	An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed
?	Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios.
?	Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process
?	Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error
?	Increase monitoring on new log files
?	Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness

Dear Harry and Dave, 

I wanted to summarize where we are currently at in relation to the Automated Confirms project and to pass on our preliminary findings from our analysis. Bear with me this is a long email.

We completed a very high-level analysis of the value we believe would be created for Enron, Enron's trading partners, and a Systems Integrator. We based our model on the architecture you have currently proposed. 
The value created for Enron Online will be significant based on value associated with increasing the volume of trades on Enron Online and driving additional liquidity into the market. We also included, in the Enron value calculation, revenue for providing the service to trading partners. We believe additional value will also be created by offering other products through this channel but we did not estimate this.

By leveraging some in-depth analysis we did based on other markets (not power and gas) the value to Enron's largest trading partners for doing automated confirms is not quite as compelling as it might appear on the surface. Our high-level estimates put the value at around $800 thousand per year on average. This is made up of reduced risk from incorrectly marked deals, more accurate position reporting, and efficiencies in the mid and back office personnel. Based on your current model it would cost a trading company $200-$500 thousand dollars to set up the service plus ongoing transaction fees or subscriptions. This service might not be as easy to sell as we initially thought. 

Based on your proposed architecture, the system integrator revenue would be $200K - $400K per installation for somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 - 20 major trading partners. Assuming an average of $300K for 15 sites the total services fees would be a total of $4.5 million without including any additional fees from ongoing transactions. 

This back of the envelope analysis is based on a lot of assumptions and some past work we did for other markets including other energy commodities such as crude. I'm sharing this in the spirit of openness and invite you to challenge us on any glaring flaws you see as we are not claiming that this is a perfect analysis or that we went to a great level of detail. However, some suggestions we have based on this are as follows:
You must make this as easy and inexpensive as possible to get organizations connected, possibly viewing this as a loss leader. This is because the largest value is created for Enron through increased transaction throughput not from charging for the service. Alternatively, you might think of adding additional services from day one to increase the value to the trading companies and get them to sign up more rapidly. You may want to consider co-operating with other online / offline services to increase number of automated confirms so that trading companies can take greater advantage of the Enron service.

You should take another look at the architecture and give consideration to how you could more easily get companies online, possibly without the need for large integration fees or additional hardware. Once people are online it would be easier to sell a more robust solution that would involve actually putting a server on their premise.  

You might want to consider some type of market assessment of the trading partners to determine exactly what they would like but more importantly what they would be willing to pay for. This could dramatically alter your go-to-market strategy.

As I shared with Dave, at this point without further analysis or a change to the proposed model, we (Ed, Milind, and I) would never be able to get Sapient to agree to  a significant cash investment in the partnership. What we would propose could take the form of "sweat equity" on the part of Sapient to train a team on the API's and feet on the street to go and talk to trading companies about the opportunity.

We also could offer to do a co-funded (Sapient and Enron) market assessment to take a two to four weeks to flush out the business model and analyze what trading companies would be willing to pay for in the way of additional products and services. We do believe that if you completed the assessment you would be better able to strengthen your go-to-market strategy.

Keep in mind that we are sharing these thoughts because we do want to develop a relationship and just as importantly want your team to be successful in this venture even if that means there is not a role for Sapient. Also if someone is telling you something that is contrary to our findings based on their analysis please give me a call because I definitely want to understand if we are fundamentally missing something.  

I will follow-up with each of you over the next week to see how you are progressing. Please call or email me with any thoughts or reactions.

Sincerely, 

Lee Henderson

Miguel,

EGEP extends our best wishes to you on pursuing your new assignment and expresses sincere appreciation for all of your assistance with our DealBench projects. 

You probably follow the DealBench activity but if you haven't watched specific details, we have observed the following activity level to date:
	India Deal Rooms A-G		9573 Deal and Document hits (since 27 Dec when stats became available)
	India Deal Room  H		  417 Deal and Document hits (since opening 1 Feb)
	China Deal Rooms A-B		  500 Deal and Document hits (since opening 23 Feb)

We consider the DealBench datarooms a great success.  We appreciate the insights you shared with us when we were first designing the rooms, as well as, the support  you provided with regard to our questions and problems thereafter.  You were always knowledgeable, resourceful, responsive and courteous in all of our dealings.

Thanks again, Miguel.  We will miss you in the DealBench project group but will look forward to hearing about your new assignment.  

Sincerely,
Paula

Hi all,

I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.

Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual 
datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total 
number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to 
host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis 
that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts 
into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer 
is for the year 2001.

We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved 
dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2. 

You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger 
than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to 
greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the 
platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to 
download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 
minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it 
will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download 
is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our 
help-desk.

As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance 
with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together 
with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our 
experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing 
this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on 
the TIFF files during conversion to PDF. 

In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start 
the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you 
suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are 
very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.

Thanks

Tobias Munk

All,

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging environment.  To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff prior to a release to production.  Please read the attached one page document that details the proposed process.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Zach

Hi Harry,
 
Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.  How's everything in Houston?  Things in banking are slowing  down.  I'm just hoping that this project I'm staffed on will go live.   There is a 90% chance.  Most activity now in Asia is M&A related.   You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.  High yield and convertibles appear to be rocketing.  I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but so far things are  okay.    Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to park the  money.  Maybe I'll invest it in power technology since California  lacks electricity.  Who knows.  
 
I heard from Jens that you moved to Enron Online.  Jens got a great  vacation in Cuba.  I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.
 
Best regards,
 
Roy

here is another request for a direct EOL data feed.  We should figure out how 
we want to respond to such inquiries.  I have never heard of this company

Good Day to you.
I would like to introduce myself and my company.
Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.
Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
companies.
One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
I go about getting it.
We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
this respect.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

With kind regards

e system will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or who=

t remember that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the =
other OTC products on the system  are dealt with differently .  It also ser=
ves to highlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 =

good weekend spot. If u visit Bombay, do drop in Daman. U can also plan a
journey to Diu, Dwarka, Somnath and Gir tiger reserve.


Keep in touch.

Wow !! Big brother is watching you... Thanks for your message. Actually, we
are quite impressed by how smooth the whole process is. But I think that my
colleague is talking to you at the moment... So far so good. We will see how
banks respond to the system. Many thanks indeed. With kind regards, JM

Hi Jean-Maurice,

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how your DealBench experience
is going.  I realize you may have some colleagues that are working with you
that may not have been in our demo in November.  I'm happy to spend some
time with them on the phone walking through the functionality within the
site.  Please feel free to call me at 713-345-3726.

I look forward to hearing from you to know how things are going.

Kind Regards,
Kristi DeMaiolo

Regarding the lotting strategy, we do intend to be very flexible. Our general 
recommendation is that the number of lots should be around 10 but if there 
are situations where it makes sense to have more than 10 lots, we would not 
have a problem with it.
>From a pricing perspective, as long as bids*lots is less than 150, we would 
treat it in a similar way.

Hope that works for you. Look forward to your confirmation (and the RC#)

Harry-

Before we go ahead with this, let's revise the first bullet to reflect a more 
realistic variation of how our soliciations might play out over the first and 
second quarter of  2001. 

As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct, 
at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each of 
the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attached 
Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers 
to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for 
this phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar 
model. 

Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6 
sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid. Does this work 
for you or does this complicate the process for your group? 

Please advise....

We very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing opportunities 
for EES and DealBench to work together.  As we discussed, this email will 
serve as the framework for our pilot arrangement.  As soon as we receive an 
email confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to the 
DealBench platform.

3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots for 
each deal) .  Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal 
is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be 
inlcuded as part of the three month period.

EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500 
due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st.  We would like to debit your RC 
directly to avoid billing overheads. 
 
EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions that 
it conducts on the DealBench platform.  As such, DealBench assumes no 
liability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench.

We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forward 
to working with you.  As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a Live 
Auction for you and save you some significant money.  Please confirm, with 
your RC number that you are IN with this arrangement. We also would want to 
explore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one to 
work on that one with you next week.


Regards,


Harry Arora

Hi Harry,
?
Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.? How's everything 
in Houston?? Things in banking are slowing  down.? I'm just hoping that this 
project I'm staffed on will go live.?  There is a 90% chance.? Most activity 
now in Asia is M&A related.?  You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. 
Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.? High yield and convertibles appear 
to be rocketing.? I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but 
so far things are  okay.??? Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to 
park the  money.? Maybe I'll invest it in power technology?since California  
lacks electricity.? Who knows.? 
?
I heard from Jens that you moved to Enron Online.? Jens got a great  vacation 
in Cuba.? I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.
?
Best regards,
?
Roy

Miguel,

EGEP extends our best wishes to you on pursuing your new assignment and 
expresses sincere appreciation for all of your assistance with our DealBench 
projects. 

You probably follow the DealBench activity but if you haven't watched 
specific details, we have observed the following activity level to date:
 India Deal Rooms A-G  9573 Deal and Document hits (since 27 Dec when stats 
became available)
 India Deal Room  H    417 Deal and Document hits (since opening 1 Feb)
 China Deal Rooms A-B    500 Deal and Document hits (since opening 23 Feb)

We consider the DealBench datarooms a great success.  We appreciate the 
insights you shared with us when we were first designing the rooms, as well 
as, the support  you provided with regard to our questions and problems 
thereafter.  You were always knowledgeable, resourceful, responsive and 
courteous in all of our dealings.

Thanks again, Miguel.  We will miss you in the DealBench project group but 
will look forward to hearing about your new assignment.  

Sincerely,
Paula

Here is McKinsey's work.  Broad overview only, with no specific analysis of 
grains, meats or softs.  Priorities here are grains, then meats, and 
separately 
softs given our existing exposure to this segment (53k Tons of Cocoa Physical,
Softs Brokerage Business in London).

Mark, I would encourage you to come down to 29 (assuming you are on 33) and
we will be more than happy to share all of our resources to get you up to 
speed
on our analysis and why we think these segments hold a lot of opportunity.

Regards,
Darren Maloney

Good Day to you.
I would like to introduce myself and my company.
Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.
Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
companies.
One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
I go about getting it.
We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
this respect.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

With kind regards

Graham Mansfield
Deputy Managing Director

Paul,

I would be happy to meet on Tuesday maybe I could host you guys for lunch here and we could spend
the afternoon looking at possibilities.

I have asked Peggy my Assistant to keep Tuesday open as of noon.

Looking forward to meeting on Tuesday.

Kind Regards,

P.

Subject:	DealBench


Philippe,

Thank you for presenting us with the opportunity to work with Enron around
the DealBench play. Since we last met we have been busy promoting the idea
of working with Enron on DealBench to our Supply Chain Service Line
leadership partners.   I believe we have convinced them that there is a
nice fit between Deal Bench and our own Auction Services play (known as
Dynamic Pricing Solutions or DPS).  We would like to get back together with
you and your team early next week, preferably Monday afternoon and Tuesday
to sort through the potential shape of an ongoing arrangement.  We believe
the combination of Accenture's relationships, assets and book of business
in the Auction Services space creates a tremendous platform for helping
Enron generate value from your DealBench investment.  Our DPS group
provides a ready made model for bringing Auction Services to the market
place in a way that fully leverages our 15,000+ supply chain resources.

As you and your team pointed out there are many options to forming a
relationship going forward.  During our meetings with you we would like to
further explore the manner in which we might work together to collectively
service the marketplace.   The possibilities to consider would be the items
you listed in the packet you shared with us:

     DealBench/Accenture Marketing Alliance
     DealBench/Accenture Special Purpose Vehicle

Our initial view is that the Special Purpose Vehicle is likely to be the
optimum structure.  This view is based on the fact that we both have
similar assets, resources and market potential that would likely fit
together in a combination of some kind very well.  We see working together
but with separate competitive offerings or simply the addition of another
tool to our offering as limiting over the long term.

As a path forward, I have asked our DPS group to work with us to develop a
synergistic play.  They are available early next week to provide you and
your team an overview of the offerings we are currently providing to the
marketplace.  After we demonstrate our DPS offering we can discuss the
appropriate aspects of the Special Purpose Vehicle and if appropriate
determine the go forward approach.  It is our view that both parties would
assign dedicated resources to drive out the structure, business plan
(including offering scope, operating model, cost estimates, capital
requirements) and overall initial contributions of the parties.  We think
this effort could be completed in 1 or 2 weeks at most.

We are excited about the possibilities of working with Enron on this
initiative and appreciate your willingness to work with Accenture.  I will
be calling you later today to set-up the logistics for the discussions next
week.  I will ask our people to come to Houston for these meetings.  In the
meantime you can reach me at 713-837-2406.


Regards,


Paul

Looks like EES has pretty much decided to use us for this RFQ (see the Word 
doc attached below) -- remember that we have a meeting scheduled with EES on 
Monday to discuss a "realtionship" and pricing.  Let's make sure before our 
meeting that we are all in agreement as to the pricing approach we will take 
with them.

John,

I have attached a link to the first iteration of the DataRoom spec.  Due to all the screen shots, the file is too large to email.  Please review the document and I am fully available to try and answer all of the questions that will arise.  Tobias and I reviewed what we had come up with with Suresh this morning.  He added some good insights that have been incorporated into the document.  There still are some outstanding issues (noted in the document), but this should provide a detailed starting point for the development of the DataRoom.

Take a read and let me know when you want to meet.

Thanks,
Zach
