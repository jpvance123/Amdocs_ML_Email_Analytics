Jeanne, Perry,

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

Attached are the spreadsheets for September and October.  There is a measurement issue on 9/27.  Finalized TW measurement at the Interconnect shows 39455 Mmbtus, whereas SCADA from Gas Control at the inlet to the plant shows a volume of 58411 Mmbtus, therefore creating a difference of 19949 between the interconnect and the inlet to the plant.  Craig, I don't know if you have a more accurate number or if we just want to go with the 39455 measured volume since I believe it to be the most accurate volume.

Please respond with your feedback on this issue.

 
 
Thank you!
Amy Mulligan

I wanted thank everyone involved in the Bushton ESD. Bushton Operations, for planning a smooth timely ESD. Ken Anderson, and John Sturn for finding a way keep some flows going through the station. The Gas Controllers for your input and your patients. And the rest of the Beatrice Region for your cooperation in setting up the pipelines and H.P. Through your efforts we were able to (1) Minimize the impact to our customers (2) Maintain the require flows north, and (3) Have a successful ESD. 

Thanks again, your hard work was greatly appreciated.

Jerry Graves

The Dumas plant is going to Derhime starting at 9:00 am tomorrow, Friday March 22nd.  They will continue to flow approximately 35,000 dth of raw gas.  They DO NOT have a processing agreement with OneOk at Bushton, but the gas will physically be diverted into the B-Line due to it being raw.  

The plan is for them to be down through Tuesday morning at 9:00 am, subject to changes that may extend the time.

Any questions, please call.

not send one to me today.  It is their standard nom by day.  Since they are

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at 
the TW afternoon marketing meeting.

	I'm confused?  Are we allocating at this time to be sure the imbalance does not
	grow any more?  Thanks. Lynn

that would be one of our options if they don't cash out the balance as of 12/31/01

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Devon SFS

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.  The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.  In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.  I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his
email...

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.
Donna Scott is working with the mail room. 

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

	Tnx, Alma G.

FYI,
An innovative solution to resolve a major outage.  Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft were both tagged on the e-mail.  We plan on bringing the Bearing Manufacturer in to record alignment readings when the unit is scheduled down for testing safety devices. After the bearing is manufactured we will rescheduled the unit down to complete the bearing replacement and compressor work.  Just wanted to keep you guys in the loop.
Any questions, give me a call.

Station 4 overhaul meeting. 

  Today discussions took place in reference to the overhaul work scopes for all three units at station 4. Participants included  Jonny Hendricks, Randy Johnson, Rick Smith, Matt Frances, and myself. From the Gallup team we had Pat Troncoso, Walt Rhoda, and Robert Stearns. We also had Roy Smith on the Phone for discussion on unit 401.

  During discussions on unit 401 which is the line bore project we discussed option to correct bearing problems related to the alignment on unit 401. It was suggested  that the problem could probably be corrected by installing a custom built bearing in the journal that appears to be out of align with the rest. We are making arrangements to take the unit down so that measurement can be taken so the custom bearing can be built. By going this route the outage time required to complete will be significantly reduced as will as the overall cost. The original outage was 40 days. Now we should be able to complete the work indicated on the scope in about 14 days. We are still planning to complete the compressor work that was in the scope along with R&R on turbo coolers and some miner upper end work.

  Scope of work for unit 402, and 403 remains pretty much the same. The only thing that was changed from the original scope was the plan to change all main bearings on both units. At this time we do not see any reason for that so none will be changed. The Gallup team plans to boreascope the units during there upcoming outage for maintenance. If anything is identified by the team or by Matt during the analysis we will make the appropriate arrangements to cover that cost during our outage.

  Please take a look at the attached scopes to verify that the changes we discussed are complete and nothing is left out.

Thanks for everyone's participation!

Ronnie.....

Just so that everyone is aware, the units at Station 4 can be operated at l=
evels above their rated horsepower of 4,000 during periods of lower ambient=
 temperatures.  Clark ambient rating increase from 100% torque at 100degF t=
o 108% torque at 40degF.  I realize that this rating is weather dependent, =
but the horsepower is available if weather temperatures permit.
=09To obtain ambient rating as ambient temperatures permit, three unit modi=
fications would have to be implemented; these might be handled by unit cont=
rol programming only.  Clark allows ambient rating when jacket water and lu=
be oil temperatures can be driven down proportionally to 135 and 125 degF r=
espectively.  Jacket water and lube oil control valves may be needed to red=
uce jacket water and lube oil temperature as ambient temperature permits, a=
nd unit control programs would require modification to accommodate ambient =
ratings. =20
=09There may be environmental emission issues such as permitting the site f=
or the higher horsepower.  Also, previous checks with Legal indicated these=
 units could operate in the ambient rated zone if the units were purchased =
with this capability; ambient rating capability was part of the original pu=
rchase and stated as such in the unit purchase orders.
=09Again, I am just making sure everyone is aware of the unit capability at=
 Station 4.

Viewing Tip: maximize window and increase zoom to 150% to get better view o=
f figures below (View, Zoom..., select percent number and type 150)

Based on recent capacity concerns or inquiries by E&C, Gas Control and Oper=
ations regarding Compressor Station 4 capacity in a 3 unit Red Rock Project=
, Planning and Optimization have re-evaluated models to put these concerns =
to rest.  Figures 1 and 2 below detail steady state results from modeling t=
hat Planning used for determining the respective capacities, as have been p=
rovided in the past. =20

Figure 1 shows the pipeline simulation maximizing horsepower at CS 1, 2 & 3=
 to pull discharge pressure off of CS 4, thus allowing CS 4 to operate with=
in its Rated HP (11800 BHP).  Note: CS 1, 2, & 3 in the first diagram Figur=
e 1 are modeled conservatively using 83% efficiency; however, Gary Choquett=
e represents that having evaluated the horsepower curves made available by =
the vendor, there is still much horsepower available for compression at CS =
1, 2 & 3.  The compression efficiencies at the stations may be achieved as =
high as 87%, thus providing more capacity to pull gas from CS4.  It is cust=
omary Planning practices to error on the conservative side until facilities=
 are installed.  Once installed and the true performance can be realized th=
en the opportunity shall exist for further optimization.

Based upon the pipeline model with CS1, 2, & 3 at 83% efficiency, the range=
 of conditions that may be expected at CS4 are suction pressures between 76=
9 - 776 psig with discharge pressure at about 923 psig.  The HTSCompress mo=
del for CS4 has been modified to closely match field performance testing.  =
These results shown in Figure 2 also represent that the 1230 MMcfd capacity=
 will be more than achievable even at the lesser operating conditions shown=
.

However, if any capacity shortfalls might be experienced, several measures =
can be implemented to improve conditions (some of which are currently plann=
ed).
1.=09Operate San Juan Junction pressures at or above 960 psig (currently ac=
hievable, measure would provide higher suction pressure to CS4)=20
2.=09Perform engine and compressor overhauls at CS4(work is slated for Marc=
h-April 2002 timeframe)
3.=09Install/modify scrubbers and inlet piping at CS4 to reduce inlet pipin=
g losses (work is slated for post Red Rock, scrubbers from CS 1, 2, & 3 wil=
l be relocated to CS4)
4.=09Relocate evaporative cooling skirts from CS 1 or 2 after Red Rock unit=
 installation to CS 4 to prevent horsepower derating due to high ambient te=
mperatures.
5.=09Modify programming at CS4 to optimize speed control maximizing availab=
le HP (this done at existing CS 1 & 2 have realized 1% throughput improveme=
nts).  Also modifying unloading sequence could be considered.
6.=09Pig/clean main and loop lines from CS 5 to CS 4 (pipeline efficiency i=
n this segment is lower compared to segments due west, cleaning would incre=
ase suction pressures at CS4 or allow lower junction pressures.)
7.=09Maximize available HP at CS1, 2, & 3 (all horsepower at 86% efficiency=
 as shown in second diagram Figure 1)

Should further discussion be required, do not hesitate to give us a call.  =
A conference call can be scheduled if needed; otherwise, save this informat=
ion for August 2002.  EF

If our demands are not met by the end of today, we will be forced to sign over all our Enron stock options to your organization.  This will cause your organization to implode!!

Subject:	Toaster

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!  

EPLF -- you're TOAST!!!!!

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his
email...

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.
Donna Scott is working with the mail room. 

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

	Tnx, Alma G.

Do to the pressure being lowered to 520 psig at LaCresent on the discharge for this outage, I have reset the HI & HI HI alarm limits to give us fore warning should the regulator fail.
								Original Alarm Values		New Alarm Values
					LaCresent discharge -  HI  715	HI HI  725		HI  525    HI HI  530
					Tomah # 1 Inlet PSI  -  HI  725	HI HI 750		HI  525	  HI HI  530

FYI, 

This outage was move up from 10/25/01 to 10/2. The  outage will last from 10/02 to 10/08. We wanted to get this done earlier in the month. This is a Platteville Team outage, but the pressure reduction on the B/L is controlled by the Owatonna Team. See the details below, and the contact people.

Tomah Valve #4 replacement.  Install new valve setting 11901-BYB04 @ the Sparta Takeoff. Stopple fittings will be installed upstream and downstream of BV BYB04 and a 4" temp.bypass fab. & installed. Reduce pressure for excavation to 65% maop (520 psig) regulated at LaCrescent during stopple ops.

I talked to Lavila Lawrence and Duke has postponed the "permanent" shut down of this plant.  The last date she gave me was April 1st but this has been extended to an undetermined date for now.

Soon as I heard anything different I will let everyone know.

Charlie, the D/R is the corrosion inhibitor application. If Gallup is the 14th and 15th it may be possible to move it before your Gallup ESD. What about after your Gallup ESD?

Jerry,  What is the D/R?  May 15 is a conflict with our Gallup ESD.  How
long will you be down, and can move that to May 9, 10, or another date that
shows no scheduled maintenance on this calendar?

All GC's

After utilizing the Gallup Peak Avoidance program and talking with Gary Choquette the following procedures should be used to minimize power usage during peak periods.  The unit should be slowed down when the digital Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) goes into alarm and reads "PEAK".  The unit should remain slowed down until the Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC) returns to "NORMAL".  The program will be adjusted to insure the unit is slowed down long enough to avoid the peak.  The analog values are to provide advance warning that a peak may occur.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thanks
Dale

I have set up POI 78269 for this fuel delivery. I need someone to provide the following information in order to complete setup of the POI.

Is the West Texas Supply basin correct?
Is the East of Thoreau Area correct?
Should the point have GRI yes or no?
What is the Lateral ID to be used?
What is the Marketing Lateral ID to be used?

Perhaps we should look at applying the drag reducer sooner.  With Bisti out of service, the drag reducer may give us some additional capacity.

What do you think?

Ben:  Please check and see if the DR application w/o Bisti gives us enough additional capacity to warrant an earlier application.

I did talk to Gas Measurement and they are only showing 4 hours of flow on the 5th, I'm not sure about the 6th . Verlene is checking with the measurement techs. and they'll probably  have to poll the stations again to get the volumes into the system correctly.

PLEASE NOTE:

Dan's Director/Staff meetings scheduled for January 22 - 23, 2002 will be held in the Enron building.  Originally these meetings were going to be held at the Sheraton Houston North.  I have canceled all reservations with the Sheraton.

You need to make your own hotel reservations at the hotel of your choice.

January 22 - 23, 2002 meetings will be held in EB13C2 (7:30AM - 5:00PM).  
Agenda will be distributed at a later date.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,=
 SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al=

e following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours=
 after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat=

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=

equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

TK

I added a tab "monthly" which accumlates the monthly imbalances per operator.  The accumulated monthly total balance would be the monthly oba imbalance net.

Would this be useful information until we develop the automated version.

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or
 electric power trading.

 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March).
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html

Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)

For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html

 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more.
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.

As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,=

 after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificat=

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove=
 all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Ja=

Subject:=09RE: Paper Situation

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=
mmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the=
 stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is t=
he last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are how=
ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toas=
ter without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use i=
t. =20

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his
email...

When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep 
track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions.
Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks DS

	SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT...........LYNDA


Subject: Fwd: A wonderful Message by George Carlin- of all people!

          The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller
          buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower
          viewpoints.

          We spend more, but have less. We buy more, but enjoy less.

          We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences,
          but less time.

          We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less
          judgment, more
          experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

          We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh
          too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get
          up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too
          seldom.

          We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.

          We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

          We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

          We've added years to life not life to years.

          We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble
          crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.

          We conquered outer space but not inner space.

          We've done larger things, but not better things.

          We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.

          We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.

          We write more, but learn less.

          We plan more, but accomplish less.

          We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

          We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more
          copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

          These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and
          small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

          These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier
          houses, but broken homes.

          These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway
          morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do
          everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.

          It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and
          nothing in the stockroom.

          A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time
          when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
          delete.

          Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are
          not going
          to be around forever.

          Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
          because
          that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

          Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that
          is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't
          cost a cent.

          Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved
          ones, but most
          of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it
          comes from deep inside of you.

          Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that
          person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to
          speak and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind

The measurement for meter 9800 - NNG Beaver -  was about 100,000 mmbtus lower than expected in Feb 2002.  Would you please check to see if you expect adjustments to be made?

Jerry,  Again, I want to apologize for missing your meeting.  Our lawyers
won't let me leave town while we are preparing for the FERC hearing.

The attached calendars show the reductions of capacity coming out of San
Juan (blue bars), on the North Mainline going to California (yellow) and on
the Crossover going east from San Juan (green with outline).

In April, I will have to separate the Seligman and L 1300 jobs.  Can't have
both the same week.

There looks like there are some measurment problems.  Therefore this report has not been done for these days.  Checking with measurement regarding the variances between scheduled and actuals

        Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn

It was reported in the morning meeting today that NGPL Trailblazer will be having an outage April 9,10&11, at which time there will be no gas available to flow at the  trailblazer interconnect. Jerry would you check with Beatrice and see if there is anything we need to plan on our side at this time.

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

	In checking contract data on Sunday after we implemented, we have come across several delivery points that are in the old CBS system & they appear to be valid on pools and interruptible contracts. I know when we got together on our displacement list for the new system, these points did not come up from anyone as valid displacement points, so the new system does not have these points identified as displacement. Can you verify & let me know ASAP on Monday if these points below should be displacement points or not.

Thanks Ramona

Laura, let me visit with Darrell to see what would be the best date to schedule the hot tap. The 20th is the week of Thanksgiving, maybe the week after would be better. Like the 26th or 27th. I'll get back to you soon and let you.

WE need to do a 12" hot tap on the West Texas Loop line for the Agave
Interconnect.  This will be just north of the Atoka II junction.  I think we
can be ready for the hot tap by 11-20-01 based on when we should be
receiving materials.  The tap is to be in service by 12-1-01.  The pressure
at the time of the tap needs to be reduced to a maximum of 712 psig.  Is
there a good time to do the tap or a good time not to?  Attached is the
outage report.

To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages, but this is  from my good friend Pearlas Sanborn and she really is an attorney.  If she  says that this will work - it WILL work.  After all, what have you got to  lose?
 
 
 
SORRY EVERYBODY.....JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!!
I'm an attorney, and  I know the law.  This thing is for real.
Rest assured AOL and Intel will  follow through with their promises for fear of facing a multimillion dollar  class action suit similar to the one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric  not too long ago.
 
 
 
We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta test without  getting a little something for our time.  My brother's girlfriend got in on  this a few months ago.  When I went to visit him for the Baylor/UT  game.
 
 
 
She showed me her check.  It was for the sum of $4,324.44 and was  stamped "Paid In Full".  Like I said before, I know the law, and this is  for real.
 
 
 
Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them the largest  Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL remains the most widely  used program, Intel and AOL are running an e-mail beta test.
 
 
 
When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will track it (if  you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two week time period.
 
 
 
For every person that you forward this e-mail to, Microsoft will pay you  $203.15.
 
 
 
For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, Microsoft will  pay you $156.29.
 
 
 
And for every third person that receives it, you will be paid $17.65.   Within two weeks, Intel will contact you for your address and then send you a  check.
I thought this was a scam myself, but a friend of my good friend's  Aunt Patricia, who works at Intel, actually got a check of $4,543.23 by  forwarding this e-mail.
 
 
Try it, what have you got to lose????

I have a couple of questions Jerry, however I think they would  be easier to discuss over the phone.  I will  be back in the office next week so maybe we can hook up.

FYI,

Hey guys the attached report has the outages related to the Red Rock expansion. I asked Ron, if you guys could take a look at the estimated flow affect you see in the highlighted boxes. The reason is, because I moved unit 401's overhaul into March. The same time period we are doing the tie-ins for Station 1 & 3. The hope is to reduce the total throughput loss, and also reduce the down time. I talked with Jan Moore and told her there will probably be a modification of the affected flows.

Thanks

Jerry

All testing was completed, but we encountered problems accessing www.nbp.enron.com.  We've notified the Hot Tap team and they are investigating.  We were able to access www.nbpl.enron.com internally, but they had problems accessing it from outside the Enron environment.  We will update you as soon as we have more information.

We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

FYI
  Oneok is making changes in their field behind Cargray Plant this week which will increase flow by 8,000 mmbtu/d and by the end of the month they plan to be up to 20,000 mmbtu/d.

Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.

The Griffith plant is currently down and will probably be down for the rest of the month.  I have put a zero capacity in CAS for the deliveries through 10/31/01.  If it should come up for allocation please analyze whether it is due to flow rate.  As long as it schedules to zero, we are fine, you can ignore the flow rate.  

The contracts which are currently scheduling there must be balanced at zero, if we allocate because of a flow rate the system generates, I may have to put on an imbalance the next morning in order to get the contracts to balance.  If you have any questions while allocating, please ask me.

Thanks for your help in this matter,
Amy

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

Jerry as mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we are still investigating the vibration issue on the compressor end of unit #26 at Mullinville.  To bring everybody up to speed (no pun intended) we have Hickham Industries scheduled to be on site WEdnesday and Thursday this week to continue the analysis.  My hope is to have a plan of attack this Friday, that will give us some timelines to shoot for.

As of today the outage I believe has been extended to the end of this month, and pending our analysis results it may have to be extended for a couple of more weeks.  Jerry, I will keep you informed if you can keep everyone else informed within Gas Control, Planning and System Optimization.  Thanks if you have any questions give me a call (515)275-9606

  Gas Control looks at the 3 receipt/delivery points we have with Viking an=
d net everything out at Pierze. Dependant on pressures on both sides at the=
 Pierze point determines whether we have to run. We try to batch if we can =
on our side if it fits our operation. We may not always be able to do it if=
 it does not work for them. In some ways there maybe a trade off between ru=
nning Alex or Pierze.  Now that we are getting into winter months  we are g=
oing to want to keep our pressure up higher for Benson,  There may have bee=
n times that we may have lost a opportunity to not run Pierze, but sometime=
 it may look like a opportunity but all the pieces may not fit for everyone=
. Gas Control will continue to try shut Pierze down when they can and with =
the cooler temperatures Viking may run with higher pressure which would all=
ow us to free flow more often. Is there a economic difference between runni=
ng Pierze vs. Alex? We are always open for suggestion or ideas so if you se=
e something operational that would make for a better operation please give =
us a call.

Thanks,=20

Gary,

I think we have discussed this issue a bit at a Winter OPS meetings, but I =
was in Willmar the other day and took the to do to bring it up again.

When we run the Pierz Compressor, it is about $300 a day in electric bills.=
  That in and of itself, is not a big deal if there was no other way to ope=
rate the system.  It appears to us if the pressures on Viking's system stay=
 at a good level, we can free-flow nearly twice as much gas into our system=
 through valving and save the cost of running horsepower.  There were times=
 over the past months where we operated like that for extended periods and =
we realized a huge savings in O&M $$.  It did not seem to be a big deal to =
keep the unit idle.=20

We will not claim to understand all the "ins and outs" of the system.  We s=
ee our little part of the world, and it appears to us at least on the surfa=
ce, that there may be a much more economical and more efficient way to run =
one of our facilities.  We ask you to take some time and provide us with so=
me of Houston's background thinking on the operation of the Pierz Compresso=
r Station.

Thanks,=20
Tom

	I want to remind everyone when NNG calls on the Carlton Resolution, we can NOT
	allow ANY deliveries at Carlton.  

	At each cycle, please be sure you monitor any deliveries at Carlton
	and let Steve, Gary or Darrell know if you see any nominations.  At that
	point Carlton Deliveries should be allocated to zero (0).

	If you have any questions, or we need to discuss further, please let me know.
	Thanks. Lynn

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Let Madeleine know ASAP about the arrangements.  We have a real cheap rate.  Let's not lose it.  I've talked to Rich J. and it's okay to start the PNM. meeting later.  They will supply lunch.  If you don't know, we have to take a shuttle to pick up the rental car.  Not like the old days at the terminal.

 20% is absolute low on surge margin for this unit.   IF IT GOES BELOW 20% RAISE THE SUCTION SET POINT!!!   The unit will lock into minimum RPM when surge margin hits 15% and will not unlock until surge margin gets above 20%.   Recommended to change set point in 10#  increments when lowering set point so surge margin can be better monitored.   Alarm limits have changed.

                                                                                                                  LO - 25

We received 2 pigs at Gallup today at 1305 MDST with a pressure of 816# and a flow rate of 800 MMCF/D.
We had about 2 gallons of black liquid in the receiver barrel. We took a sample for analysis.
The Station inlet scrubber was checked and no liquid was noted.

Thanks,
The Gallup Team

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

	Marketing has informed gas control that there is now a common OBA between the Pecos and Ward points.  This means that we can now sum the two schedules together and make the delivery at either point.  Lonestar gas control is also fully aware of this.

Looks good to me structure wise. Linda, are you going to set them up in model office? Let me know what the two group names are when you are done.

Thanks

Charlie & Wayne,
I did get some more displacement points from Gas Control today so here is the  updated list.
I wanted to be sure the TMS validations for the displacement groups is added in your coding. We will set up the displacement group. Call it "Dispacement IT Group" which should be a valid receipt and delivery group for IT contrcts. The other Displacement group is called Displacement SP Group. This group will need to follow the same rules and validations for pools(point is only valid for the basin that it belongs to). Also, this group is only valid as a receipt group for SP contracts. 

The Bi-dierctional points will not need a list since TMS will read the point flow indicator of "B" & allow both receipts & deliveries to be nominated for "IT" contracts. Any Bi-directional points on Firm  will have the points tied directly to the contract or be in a group that is ties to the Firm contract.

Linda & Darrell, please review this list & make sure it is correct

Thanks Ramona

I agree we need the displacement group, since IT contract does not have groups attached.

Ramona,

We are only tying point groups to firm contracts, IT contracts will validate against PLE.  I think we need to set up a displacement group for Charlie to validate any contract against for displacement puposes.  If this is not what is happening or we need to discuss further please let me know.

Thanks

All,
I have completed the review of the TW Displacement points and the Bi-Directional pts. and have attached a file with the points.
When reviewing the data, I have found the all points are tied to the current "All Receipts Pt. Template" correctly. My file also indicated that TW only set up this process for "IT" Interruptible contracts. If we show all the points today on the All receipt point group and the "IT" contracts have that group attached, then we should not need a new group. This would still allow marketing the flexability to allow  firm contracts to use  diplacement points or bi-directional points as alternates on a case by case and point by point basis if needed by amending the firm to add a new specific alternate point to the contract.

Thanks Ramona

I will manually enter some for our testing. 

How are we doing in setting up displacement point group? We would need that for the alternate point testing.

Attached is a spreadsheet containing all of the current TW agent relationships.  
Charlie - can you systematically enter the data from the spreadsheet into PLE?  If not let me know and I will imput as soon as I have a screen to do so.

FYI....

I have been asked to be part of a Focus Group on Enron. As I understand it,  HR is facilitating the effort to seek out employee attitudes and ideas. I don't have a lot of the particulars  but I thought it is an opportunity for me to represent any of the feelings and ideas you might have but don't know who to tell.... i.e.; what's going right or wrong and ideas on how things could be improved. I'll keep your comments confidential.
If you would add your thoughts to the discussion, drop me a note, call me or stop by and tell me.
I'll report back to y'all after the meeting...which is today at 3:00 p.m.
Thanks.....
Mike

p.s.....In my haste, I know I left some people off this e-mail.....Please pass the message to anyone you think might be interested.

Thank you

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Some users were having sporadic problems logging on to TMS this morning.
Don Daze finally isolated the problem to two terminal servers.
He took those out of service, and the problem has gone away.

All testing was completed, but we were notified by the TMS On-Call that they are looking into some problems with TMS.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

The Empire Abo volume now flows through the Agave Loco 12" Loop, however, when Agave has compressor problems the flow will come back to us.  When the Abo operator calls for their volume each morning, be sure to check for accumed flow at both locations.

Your vacation carryover to 2002, if you have any, will not be reflected accurately in eHRonline until after January 31.  Next week I will run a 2001 off duty report for each of you so at least you can confirm the total vacation days recorded.

Darrell,
 
     Whats going on man?  I was talking to Rick Dietz the other day regarding an add I saw in the paper last Sunday with Burlington Resources.  They were advertising a position for a Marketing Gas Supply Representative.  I sent them a resume.  Rick mentioned to me that you knew quite a few people over there, so if you didn't mind dropping  a word for me regarding future employment, I would sure appreciate it.  I have attached my resume below if somebody wants to see it.



 
Thanks, 

Jamie

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

	Richardson due to fuel?  Just want to be sure we should not check out any
	additional information.  Terry, thanks for your prompt reply.  Thanks. Lynn

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

FYI,

Here is the latest update on the turbine at Mullinville, unit 26. Hickham Industries is doing some analysis on the unit this week to give us a better idea of what we are looking at. Right now the completion date is 10/31/01. It could be a little longer, depending on what the think the solution is.

                       The suc set has been rasied back up to 687 which is about as low as we can go on this unit.  We were real close to tripping the unit on low suc press.  The reason is that the reading we are getting for the suc. pressure is in the YARD  and the trip alarm for the unit is set off the press on the UNIT itself , so the press at the UNIT  is lower than the reading in the YARD.   If you have any questions refer them to CHRIS GASTON  San Juan Team.

TK,
Here is another list of differences from old to new system. Are they displacement points?

	In checking contract data on Sunday after we implemented, we have come across several delivery points that are in the old CBS system & they appear to be valid on pools and interruptible contracts. I know when we got together on our displacement list for the new system, these points did not come up from anyone as valid displacement points, so the new system does not have these points identified as displacement. Can you verify & let me know ASAP on Monday if these points below should be displacement points or not.

Thanks Ramona

Today, Friday, March 22, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message. Please note that the retention and severance plan mentioned in the transcript is for the debtor companies of Enron.

Steve Cooper
Voicemail Message
Distributed Friday, March 22, 2002

Hi everybody, it's Steve Cooper.  It's Thursday evening, March 21.  I'm sorry I haven't gotten to you earlier this week, but we've been finalizing and dotting the I's and crossing the T's on the retention and severance plan.  It's that I want to update you on.

We've continued to present and represent the plan to the Creditors' Committee, and now they are comfortable with it and in support of it, which is all good news.  In order to be able to motion this up to the court, we are in the process of finalizing all the various documentation necessary -- the plan itself, the motions, the applications so on and so forth.  I am relatively confident that we will have this motioned up next week sometime.  This has gotten pushed back a number of times, but I think we now have it on track and hopefully next week will be the week.

I do apologize for the way this thing has gotten delayed.  Now that I have worked with a number of you over the last month or two, I see how quickly you move and how quickly you are used to moving - so, I've got to believe that this has been incredibility frustrating for all of you.  Once we get this motioned up, there is a notice and objection period before the court order is approved and the plan goes active.  I can't guarantee you that it's going to go active.  But, I'm pretty confident - in fact, I'm highly confident - that with the endorsement of the Creditors' Committee, the court will approve it.

However, we are not going to wait until we get approval to share the details of the plan with you.  We will put a process in place so that over the next week or so we will hold one-on-one meetings with all of you to discuss the individual participation and what these plans are going to mean to each and every one of you to eliminate to the greatest extent possible the uncertainty that everyone has been living with over the last several months.

The plan is retroactive to March 1, regardless of when the court approves it, so I want everybody to know that will be the start date.

On another subject, the merit increases and promotions for employees in the debtor companies have been finalized and communicated, with the possible exception of some MD's and VP's.  Hopefully, you have all been notified about those promotions.

On the merit increase side, I believe they have all been finalized for all employees below the vice president level.  Hopefully, by now you have received information as to what those increases are.  If you haven't, I would encourage you to speak to whoever you report to.

Everything else is moving forward.  I think we now have the employees meeting scheduled for April 11, and I'm looking forward to seeing and meeting more of you at that get together.  We are on target for pulling together a longer-term business plan for the company, and hopefully will be able to describe it to you in some detail on April 11.  

We're exchanging information and communicating with the creditors on a more regular and steady basis.  Those relationships are beginning to settle down.  I think there is actually a lot of good news that I can impart to you over the next several weeks.

I want to thank everybody for your continued efforts and understanding.  Again, I want to apologize for the way this thing has dragged, but I can assure you that Jeff McMahon, the Human Resource people, and myself have all been working like busy bees to get this program finalized and in place.  Knock on wood next week is the week.

Everybody have a great evening.  If you have any concerns, issues, or problems, please don't hesitate to give me a buzz or an Email and I will get back to each and every one of you as soon as I can.  Have a great night and thanks again for all your support, help and dedication to the ongoing Enron organization.

		From 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will split the sysAdmiral Fault Tolerance Databases and Master Services on 				NAHOU-BPMS01P and NAHOU-BPMSFT01P. The NAHOU-BPMS01P Database/Master will be used for Estate Scheduling needs and 			NAHOU-BPMSFT01P will be used for Netco Scheduling Needs. The servers may have to be rebooted during this change but no impact to the 		sysAdmiral application is expected.  After the environments are split there will be no more replication between the two servers or Fault Jan. 		Tolerance.  
Jan. 7		
		From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken 		down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

Ron, 
Here are the outages for 2001 related to Station 4. Note some of the outages and flow were coordinated together to reduce down time.

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at 
the TW afternoon marketing meeting.

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Two new flow direction controls have been added to the system for Station 5.  Flow East Control and Flow West Control.   There is also a new Flow direction discrete.

Subject: Fwd: A wonderful Message by George Carlin- of all people!

          The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller
          buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower
          viewpoints.

          We spend more, but have less. We buy more, but enjoy less.

          We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences,
          but less time.

          We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less
          judgment, more
          experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

          We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh
          too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get
          up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too
          seldom.

          We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.

          We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

          We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

          We've added years to life not life to years.

          We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble
          crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.

          We conquered outer space but not inner space.

          We've done larger things, but not better things.

          We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.

          We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.

          We write more, but learn less.

          We plan more, but accomplish less.

          We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

          We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more
          copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

          These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and
          small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

          These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier
          houses, but broken homes.

          These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway
          morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do
          everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.

          It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and
          nothing in the stockroom.

          A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time
          when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
          delete.

          Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are
          not going
          to be around forever.

          Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
          because
          that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

          Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that
          is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't
          cost a cent.

          Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved
          ones, but most
          of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it
          comes from deep inside of you.

          Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that
          person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to
          speak and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind

Jerry,
I talked to Ronnie Morse, and he says the outage at Station 4 is scheduled to be completed 5-3.  They will then send equipment in to be repaired or rebuilt and then returned to Station 6.  Am attaching outage request and if there are any questions, please call or e-mail. 
Thanks,
Steve/Laguna Team

Operations has approved the facilities at the NGPL/Eddy TW receipt point for gas flow immediately.  Until mods are made on an NGPL mainline compressor we are to expect IT noms only.  It may be several days before we should expect to see firm noms through this point.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks for everyone's help in this and forward the message to those who need this info.

Just wanted to let everyone know that I spoke with Theresa Juergens with Duke this morning.  Previously Bert had worked out with Theresa that Duke would give TW an extra 5,000 a day, Duke now wants to increase it to 7,000 a day for the 29-31.  I spoke with Helen in gas control and she said that is fine.

Thanks,
Christine

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.

Randy

These are all receipt points and are ready to flow.

This point is only flowing around 16-18 dth/day with a nomination of 194 dth/day, which is auto-confirmed.  I have confirmed this point to zero for rest of the month in order to balance.  I will monitor and make any necessary changes if the delivery volumes increase.

Help needed from each team. I need a list of all equipment that you will need when we connect a new meter run to our pipeline. All quality equipment for different volumes, efm equipment, control valves, shut in valves and etc. I'll need this by Tuesday of next week since there's a conference call to discuss and we plan to get this list to planning for future use. As some of you know we usually don't know about these connects until a level A cost estimate is given to marketing. This creates a lot of confusion by everyone once they let our customer's know what the cost to them will be without all the information.
Thanks
RJ

I now have you guys slotted for an hour and a half versus the 45 min. in the first agenda.   Knowing you suckers feed off each other it was foolish of me to think one of you much less both of you could talk for only 45 minutes... Ha    Look forward to seeing the both of you.   (Kim will be addressing the Teams Wednesday morning so you can have her time Tuesday)

The Gas Control Morning Meeting Report has been change to improve the presentation of the information in the morning meeting.  To facilitate this a number of changes were necessary on the North and Central Plans.  The most notable change was the addition of a column showing the spot rate.  There are other minor changes involving how the load is calculated in the average and spot column.  There have been no changes made to the future days on the plan.  Also, there have been minor changes made to the Permian and Anadarko plans but the basic functionality is still the same.  If you have any problems or have any question call me at 31534

Thanks

	Received a call from Peoples Co-op Service today and spoke with Phil Swenson (507-288-4004).   He informed me that there will be an outage of electrical power to Chatfield Compressor Station on 01/22/02 @ 0800 to 1600.   Phil would like to receive a call back to proceed with the outage so he can schedule it with the electric suppler.

                                                                        Thanks

If GPM Linam Ranch wants to come on this afternoon without a nom let them come on. They owe us 17,000 for the month. I will check with you before intra day 2 nom to see if they have come on. I had told them that we would not confirm any gas at Linam until we actually see some flow.

Subject:	Focus Group 

FYI....

I have been asked to be part of a Focus Group on Enron. As I understand it,  HR is facilitating the effort to seek out employee attitudes and ideas. I don't have a lot of the particulars  but I thought it is an opportunity for me to represent any of the feelings and ideas you might have but don't know who to tell.... i.e.; what's going right or wrong and ideas on how things could be improved. I'll keep your comments confidential.
If you would add your thoughts to the discussion, drop me a note, call me or stop by and tell me.
I'll report back to y'all after the meeting...which is today at 3:00 p.m.
Thanks.....
Mike

p.s.....In my haste, I know I left some people off this e-mail.....Please pass the message to anyone you think might be interested.

The best I could do was the Cypress course at 10:00 am Monday, January 21.  The Creek course was booked unitl later.  Didn't want to tee off too late.  Unless they lied to me, the fee plus cart is $36.

Ce ya there.

I thought you might find this interesting.

Next, was a presentation by Staff on the California Update. Staff gave some interesting statistics: consumption grew 16% in 1995-2000 while capacity increased by 3%. In-state capacity will be insufficient to meet peak demand. Within the 2001-2006 new generation of 3200 MW will come on line in 2001; 6500 MW will be under construction and 15,000 MW has been either tabled or cancelled. Hydropower accounts for 20-40% and will play a significant role in the next five years. This places California at the mercy of snow pack conditions for up to 40% of its requirements. Last year the snow pack was 64% of typical and this year it is at 130%. Natural gas accounts for 15% of the state's needs; therefore, 85% is imported from outside the state. (47% from Southwest; 28% Canada and 10% from the Rocky Mountain pipes).Gas fired generation will decline in the next five years according to staff for three reasons:
new generation facilities coming on line
hydro will be at normal or above levels
neighboring states will sell into California
If there are surprises such as short-term price volatility, economic growth outpaces projects, low hydro conditions, energy conservation declines, California will experience similar conditions to last year.

Week of the 18th.

Station 3, Unit 302 flywheel repair. 
3-17-2002: CES removed the damaged flywheel off the engine and helped in moving flywheel out of the engine room. Contractor that is on site for the Redrock project provide crane service for moving flywheel in and out of engine room. 

3-18-2002: I preparation of installing the spare flywheel CES discovered that the bolt holes has been bored out for an oversized bolt. Due to the modification we are unable to use this flywheel. The damaged flywheel is in route to Odessa TX to Coopers shop for repairs. Due to the amount of time repairs will take we sent the CES crew home. They will return when repairs are complete.
  Submited PAF to Robert Geheb.

3-19-2002: CES has started making repairs on the flywheel. All broken dowel pins has been removed. The existing inserts has been damaged and will need to be replaced. This will require the flywheel to be disassembled. 

3-20-2002: Discussed repairs with CES today, CES has some concerns in replacing the inserts with oversized inserts. We decided that it would be better to rotate the flywheel and drill new holes. CES is working overtime to compete the job. estimated repairs to be completed by Saturday, and ready to ship on Sunday. The CES crew will be on location the day the flywheel arrives at station 3 to reassemble the unit.

3-22-2002: I will be in Odessa to check on flywheel repairs.

Station 7, Unit 721: 
Tejas is on schedule on completion. Generator was delivered back to station 7 today and will be reinstalled on Thursday.  

Crawford Turbine, Unit 751:
I will be the Solar shop in DeSoto TX on Thursday to oversee disassembly of the first turbine that was set and failed after startup. Solar has indicated that the failure my be the results of our oil pump. I don't think so because the pump was working fine with our old turbine. Will update later.

Bisti 
Unit went down at 14:15 was thought to be a ESD but as it tuned out is was a BSD. After the team
member arrived it was determined that there was no fire. They began to work on and reset the fire eye  
 the team tried to start the unit to no avail. After trouble shooting and try to start the unit a couple of time
it was determined that the PLC programmer was bad. they then sent to Bloomfield for the new spare
 After installing the new one and determining it was bad also. It was time to call Solar after talking to their 
office and finding out that all their Reps are all in Wyoming, We talk to their specialist and they said we needed
a new PLC. We were back to square one by this time it is midnight and PLC are hard to find this late at night so 
we called on a good friend  ( Northwest Pipeline ) they had one. We then got it to Bisti and installed it.
The Unit came right up, Just to have another BSD,  We were down again. After more testing,And the winding temps 
being real hot the team thinks the motor has problems. So we will start testing it as so as possible and we get help
out there. We will keep you informed 
                      
                                                              Thanks Team San Juan

The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat

Dale ,
You need to make to where we can change the trailblazer nom on the north end plan.  We had a Minnegasco storage deal and needed to make a change to trailblazer and we couldn't do it due to it automatically downloading.  Some points automaticly downloading is fine, but I would appreciate it if you would fix this for us.

                                    Thank you,

                                     Margaret

The Gas Control Morning Meeting Report has been change to improve the presentation of the information in the morning meeting.  To facilitate this a number of changes were necessary on the North and Central Plans.  The most notable change was the addition of a column showing the spot rate.  There are other minor changes involving how the load is calculated in the average and spot column.  There have been no changes made to the future days on the plan.  Also, there have been minor changes made to the Permian and Anadarko plans but the basic functionality is still the same.  If you have any problems or have any question call me at 31534

Thanks 
Dale

I have a couple of questions Jerry, however I think they would  be easier to discuss over the phone.  I will  be back in the office next week so maybe we can hook up.

FYI,

Hey guys the attached report has the outages related to the Red Rock expansion. I asked Ron, if you guys could take a look at the estimated flow affect you see in the highlighted boxes. The reason is, because I moved unit 401's overhaul into March. The same time period we are doing the tie-ins for Station 1 & 3. The hope is to reduce the total throughput loss, and also reduce the down time. I talked with Jan Moore and told her there will probably be a modification of the affected flows.

Thanks

Jerry

Well it is that time of year again to start looking at Demarc Allocations. Please look at your Demarc Allocation procedures and review them, get with your teams and discuss them and ask questions to make sure everyone understands them.

Each person running a cycle is to look at Demarc to see if the numbers call for an allocation. This should be looked at during the Timely, Evening, ID/1 and ID/2 cycles. If the numbers look like an allocation is needed contact Gary Spraggins, Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft, Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan. 

Thanks: John Buchanan

Below is a system configuration I was asked to put together to flow 1600 MM/D through Clifton without the Bushton turbine.

A system weighted temperature of 29 F is forecasted for Thursday (vs 49 F normal) and the Bushton turbine is not scheduled to be back in-service until 11/01/01.  A 29 F temperature is not so cold per say, but north sources such as Trailblazer (240 MM/D), Carlton (50 MM/D) and Redfield (on injection) are still in the summer mode.  This could result in a high rate through Clifton.


SOURCES

Beaver C-D suction	170
Beaver KB suction	350
Net Mull interconnects	 -15
Cunningham		575
Bushton processing	540
Lyons			 -40
Pony Express		  45
Trailblazer		240


CONFIGURATION

			Clifton flow
A line	    60
B line	  210
C line	  275
D line	  475
E line	  580

Total	1600


A Line - Bushton processing return free flowing to the A line with the two Palmyra A suction to B suction turbines compressing and the Palmyra A block valve open.

B Line - Bushton compressing one unit processing plant recompress to B and cracking some to B.  Clifton 32 B to B and two Beatrice B to B units, with 75 - 100 Trailblazer flowing to the B discharge.  Palmyra compressing three units B to B or common B-C-D suction to D.

C Line - Bushton compressing two units recompress to C.  Pony Express flowing into the C line.  Clifton and Beatrice three units C to C.  Palmyra C-D or B-C-D suction to D.

Bypass stream - Beaver compressing C-D suction and KB to D-E discharging 925 PSIG or higher.  Mullinville bypassed.  Cunningham flowing to an 800 PSIG Macksville E suction with Macksville turbines 2-3-4 discharging 950 PSIG or higher.  Bushton controlling the D line pressure at Valve 4 to stay under 860 PSIG MAOP.

D Line -  Bushton bypassed on D.  Clifton unit 30 D to D.  Beatrice units 23 - 25 D to D with about 150 MM/D of Trailblazer flowing into the D suction.  Palmyra B-C-D or C-D suction to D.

E Line - Bushton bypassed on E.  Tescott unit 5, Clifton unit 31 and Beatrice unit 27 E to E.  Palmyra regulating E to B-C.


THIS MEANS?

Be sure that the required units are ready to run.  If not, let me and Gas Control know ASAP.  There are alternatives to the above depending on actual conditions.  On 10/17/01, Clifton averaged 1418 MM/d with Tescott D to D and Clifton D-E to E.


If anyone has thoughts or comments, please let me know.


John

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=

he last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are how=
ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

Subject:	LATE NIGHT NOTES

ID2:		No variances or manually scheduled items.  The confirmation phase of the cycle got slightly stalled, but not as long 			as last night's evening cycle.

EVENING:	No variances, but I did manually schedule Sempra's CR's 27342, 24136, and 26816 due to problem 3 listed below.

OTHER:	1.  Can someone review the allocations for 3/17 for Conoco's CR 22330 with Diane.  Diane seems to feel that she is 			being unfairly cut by our San Juan and WFS-Milagro allocations.  I printed the ID1 allocations, but did not get a 			chance to review.
		2.  Can someone review the critical notice posted on the internet for the LaPlata Compressor Station for April 2-5 with
		Darrell.  The affected customer list shows Red Cedar's points on the 2nd, but not on the 3rd through 5th.  Kim Thomas
		with Red Cedar does not know if her points will or will not be affected.  Please call her tomorrow morning if possible to
		verify the posting.
		3.  Sempra's CR 26816 was adjusted Friday, 3/15, to have Calpine be a primary delivery point for 14,000/day; 			however, an error within CMS has kept the point as a secondary delivery and is being allocated by San Juan FMJ.  I 			have sent an e-mail to Dennis, but could someone follow-up with him to see that it gets fixed.  You may also have to 		"touch" the nom to have the change take effect in TMS.  Jim will ask probably to extend the change in primary points 		for a longer period of time since the Bisti compressor may be down for 5 to 6 weeks.
		4.  Since the Evening cycle did not complete in a timely manner, I used preliminary numbers in Gaskit.  Please review
		the numbers with Williams after the Non-Grid.
		5.  My Bruno may have to have surgery today (3/18) for a torn ACL so I may be running a bit late for the late shift.  I 			will keep you informed.  Sorry for all the problems I am leaving for the day shift.

See you later, Bert

It seems like a lifetime ago, but the system actually behaved itself and didn't invalidate points on contracts or stall during any of the processes.

ID2:		No variances or manually scheduled items.

EVE:		Small variance at ANR due to problem with USGT at NNG-Halley.  Transcolorado is off, but I should be able to fix it on 		ID2.

We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not 
need to let this keep growing.  Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not 
to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.  We need to keep the total order in balance.
We will work on this next week.

Thanks Ds

	Earlier this week I installed some new functions at station 5 for ease in controlling the pressure regulator when the 	station is down.

	Please install the following discrete and control points.  They will effect the setpoint on register 7025.

	1031 -  Input showing flow direction   0= west   1 = east


	1160 - Will put the control in West Flow  (write a 1 to this)
	1161 - Will put the control in East Flow    (write a 1 to this)


	If this doesn't make any sense please let me know.

	Thanks
	Todd

Linda,

I am going through your list & should be able to send you the updates by the COB Tuesday or Wednesday. Most of these are accounting related reports that will be addressed with the rates and revenue project. 
Thanks Ramona

Could each of you review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS reports and let me know by Friday 1/11/02 which of the reports are being used and which are not.  Several of the reports have not been run for years.

Thanks

Linda

Linda,

Could you please have someone review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS Reports and Jobs and verify from the business perspective whether the reports/jobs still need to be functional in the CBS system once we transition to the CMS system?  Do the best you can.  Indicate for each item whether it is needed or obsolete.  David generated the list from current CBS information as of 11/12/2001.  It is my fault this did not get reviewed earlier.  This will help him as he designed the backfeed that will keep the accounting portions of CBS going.  If you are not sure of the need for certain reports, leave them blank and indicate to the right who might know this information in the business area.

Thanks!

ab.

Station 4 overhaul meeting. 

  Today discussions took place in reference to the overhaul work scopes for all three units at station 4. Participants included  Jonny Hendricks, Randy Johnson, Rick Smith, Matt Frances, and myself. From the Gallup team we had Pat Troncoso, Walt Rhoda, and Robert Stearns. We also had Roy Smith on the Phone for discussion on unit 401.

  During discussions on unit 401 which is the line bore project we discussed option to correct bearing problems related to the alignment on unit 401. It was suggested  that the problem could probably be corrected by installing a custom built bearing in the journal that appears to be out of align with the rest. We are making arrangements to take the unit down so that measurement can be taken so the custom bearing can be built. By going this route the outage time required to complete will be significantly reduced as will as the overall cost. The original outage was 40 days. Now we should be able to complete the work indicated on the scope in about 14 days. We are still planning to complete the compressor work that was in the scope along with R&R on turbo coolers and some miner upper end work.

  Scope of work for unit 402, and 403 remains pretty much the same. The only thing that was changed from the original scope was the plan to change all main bearings on both units. At this time we do not see any reason for that so none will be changed. The Gallup team plans to boreascope the units during there upcoming outage for maintenance. If anything is identified by the team or by Matt during the analysis we will make the appropriate arrangements to cover that cost during our outage.

  Please take a look at the attached scopes to verify that the changes we discussed are complete and nothing is left out.

Thanks for everyone's participation!

Ronnie.....

  GPM Dumas will be shutting their process plant down in the morning Friday, March 22, through Tuesday, March 26th. During this time Sunray will  switch them from the C-line to the B-line so it can be taken to the inlet of Bushton. Spearman and Sunray will be coordinating the switching of valves. Hutch 1 will have to be shut-in during this time since they were using the B-line to freeflow into the suction of Spearman. All parties have been notified.

The reports used in the Morning Meeting have been changed.  A new sheet called the "ets_west_region_tw_summary" has been added to the TWMAINLINE spread sheet, it is used to show long and short for the TW system.  For the morning meeting you will need to press the  F9 key, hit the Internet button, and then print this sheet.

Print and copy of the TW Map on one side, print and copy the "ets_west_region_tw_summary" on the other side,  print and copy the NNG Summary sheet separately and take to the morning meeting. The morning meeting report will now be 2 pages long.  If you have any questions call me at 31534.

The Help Desk did not receive calls on either of these items this morning.  That is positive and demonstrates that we have a process in place to resolve issues before a customer places a call.  

I do think it is important to know; 1.) how were these resolved?  2.) what caused them and how can they be avoided in the future?  

Brad

All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

If the fuel is being nominated and scheduled the only volumes hitting the OBA are the diff. between scheduled and actual and that is what the OBA's are for as long as it is not being abused.

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.

Tony,
We are beginning to pick up moisture on the Panhandle Lateral so maybe we need to pig as soon as possible after the new year.
Thanks,

FYI,

The Cunningham Electrical Substation outage will be on Wednesday (3/20). We moved it up a day, so can maintain max withdrawals on Thursday (3/21) when the temps look to be the coldest. The power company is going to start at 8:00 am, and should be complete about 12 noon.

Please let me know if you see any problems with switching the Lyons withdrawal volumes to the Bushton recompress suction on Monday, 01/14/02.

Lyons has been free flowing into the Bushton C north, but there is desire to lower the pressure on the field.  Switching to the recompress suction should lower the Lyons pressure to the 550 PSIG or less range.

The people I've talked to so far see it as a good deal.  If I don't hear of any problems I will talk to Gas Control on Monday and make the change.

Thanks,


John

FYI, 

Unit #5 was scheduled to be back available on 10/31/01. (Installing New PLC) The programmers have delayed their arrival from this week to next week to do the programming. This would push back the completion date about a week. Tom Gilbert and the Waterloo Team are not happy about this, since this is not the first time we have been delayed. They are going to look into what's going on and possible other options. 

Jerry

All testing was completed successfully, and we have confirmed with ENW Resolution Center that Exchange servers are up. 

Regarding yesterday's issues:
the ENW Resolution Center is researching further the cause of the Outlook problem that caused some people to get a login window when accessing their mail.  Some people in ETS did observe the problem, but because of the information the Resolution Center shared with us in the morning, our users were not greatly affected.
the IIS services were stopped and restarted on the server that supports access to the Flow Gas application.  We currently have no information about the root cause of the problem.

Just a quick reminder that all choirs sing this Sunday morning, October 21.


We had a great time at the recording last Saturday and I've missed you since
then.  I'm so proud of you all!!  See you Sunday!  Love, Dick

P.S.  We will pass around a sign-up this Sunday for your commitment to
participate in the Christmas program.  The deadline to commit is Sunday,
November 4.  Make sure you have sandals for Act II.  Those of you who are
new and have costumes will need to have your costume approved by Nancy
LeBeau by October 28.

Jeff,

The MAOP limits you have here sound real good to us. I visited Alan and Richard (2 of our Gas Controllers) and they had a good suggestion. When we get into a situation where we lose a station or a major delivery like Socal, and we know we will be at or above MAOP due to the roll back. Would it possible to set up the stations where the Gas Controllers could send a set point to take that station off line and put it on idle?  

Pros-  1. It would give the Controllers time to make other moves.
           2. It would give the teams time to get to the station if needed.
           3. It would reduce ware and tear on the units. (Starting & Stopping) 
           4. It would reduce call outs, which reduces overtime.

Cons-  1. There could be some $ cost to set it up.

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

I talked to Lavila Lawrence and Duke has postponed the "permanent" shut down of this plant.  The last date she gave me was April 1st but this has been extended to an undetermined date for now.

Soon as I heard anything different I will let everyone know.

Per our discussion on Friday, attached are the spreadsheets that show the
dig locations for the integrity work. Please look at the column that shows
Mile Post since there is a lot of other information on the spreadsheet that
you do not need.  We will need to have the pipeline pressure less than 655
when we excavate these locations.  We need to discuss outage dates after you
have a chance to look at the locations and do some modeling.

 One spreadsheet shows only the dents from 8-7 and 5-4 mainline and 5-4
loopline.  All of these need to be excavated. A second spreadsheet shows the
pits from 7-6.  These all need to be excavated since they did not meet the
LAPA calculation criteria.  Then, a third spreadsheet shows the pits from
8-7 and we are planning to only excavate a couple in order to verify the
LAPA calculations with R-String calculations.  There are no dents from 7-6
which need to be looked at.

8-7
>From 8-7 there are 3 dents on the mainline and they are all in an area where
the pipeline is not looped. These will all be excavated and a sleeve or
clock spring will be installed.  There are a couple of pits on the line that
will be excavated.  We will start with the pits at mile post 28.567 and
28.570.  These are in the segment of line that is looped.  If the R-String
calculations on the pits agree with the LAPA calculations, we will recoat
the line and stop with those two.  If they do not meet the LAPA
calculations, we will continue with the next closest one and continue on
until we get some agreement.  We can do the two that are not in the looped
segment last, if we have to, but we do not expect to have to excavate more
than the two.

7-6
The spreadsheet shows 19 pits that need to be checked.  However, 3 of them
have already been replaced in the Becker Flats work order, which leaves 16
pits.  Of the 16, only one is in the area that is looped.  (Murphy's law at
work here.)  All 16 pits need to be  checked and repaired with either a
sleeve or a clock spring.  However, there are really only 8 sites since some
are very close together.

5-4 Mainline
All five dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring installed.
All are in the area that is looped.

5-4 Loopline
All eight dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring
installed.  All are in the area that is looped.

Please review the attached Links Report. (Please note that the Hugoton team is still working on the final scope of work that will take place during their ESD (5/7/02). The original time frame was 2 days, and then changed to just 4 to 6 hours with another outage planned later in the summer. We don't want to have two separate outages, so they are trying to put together a plan for 1 long day.  I'll keep you posted.

FYI, 
Some of the planned overhauls for this summer may be approved in the next day or too.

	Extended forecast for the Tuesday 01/22/02, highs 32 - lows 15.   Gave Phil the go a head for his outage.   Spoke with Jim Merrick on the Owatonna team to inform him of this outage.   He informed me that the unit's breaker is locked-out, and if the unit is needed a call-out will have to be made.
                                                         Thanks

He informed me that there will be an outage of electrical power to Chatfield Compressor Station on 01/22/02 @ 0800 to 1600.   Phil would like to receive a call back to proceed with the outage so he can schedule it with the electric suppler.

FYI-
All HotTap terminal servers are back online.
Not sure if this mornings problem was caused by terminal server performance or not.  When I received a page from the HotTap Help Desk indicating that there was a possible issue with TS3 and TS4, I took both offline.  When I didn't find any indication of problems or unusual entries in the event log, I rebooted them, put them back online, and monitored for unusual activity or customer calls.  TS4 was back online at 7:45am and TS3 was back online at 8:30 am.  (I couldn't immediately reboot TS3 because there were users logged in.)  While TS3 and TS4 were offline the other 6 Houston HotTap terminal servers more than adequately handled the external customer load.  TS3 and TS4 have functioned flawlessly all day.
If you need anymore info, please let me know.
Thanks,
Don

Some users were having sporadic problems logging on to TMS this morning.
Don Daze finally isolated the problem to two terminal servers.
He took those out of service, and the problem has gone away.

All testing was completed, but we were notified by the TMS On-Call that they are looking into some problems with TMS.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

It's time to start thinking about when and where we can get together to
review the maintenance that will affect the San Juan area this year.  The
EPNG planners will have their information from the field, and we will review
it internally by the middle of February.  Can we look at late Feb or early
March?

We did not decide who would host this year's meeting when we departed last
year.  If anyone wants to volunteer, please say so.  We could consider
meeting at a neutral location (Las Vegas has been suggested).

I will coordinate our communications until someone volunteers to take the
ball.  Please e-mail your thoughts.

I added a tab "monthly" which accumlates the monthly imbalances per operator.  The accumulated monthly total balance would be the monthly oba imbalance net.

Would this be useful information until we develop the automated version.

A conf. call was held Thursday afternoon to further discuss the pigging tim=
eline of the San Juan Lateral.  Obviously there is concern with regards to =
delaying the pigging project and how that might relate to line eff and ther=
efore capacity impacts.  A request was made to re-apply the DRA asap or by =
April.  It seems that after the last pig run the line eff. held it's own fo=
r two weeks and then started to drop off significantly.  The major concern =
is, will we be able to continually bring the eff back to acceptable levels =
with dry pigging?  An agreement was reached to postpone any pigging efforts=
 until May or June while in the mean time we increase our pigging frequency=
 of the lateral and continue to monitor eff. results and cycle times.  In o=
ther words when we pig, how long before the eff. starts to drop significant=
ly.  Although it may be a long shot, if we can insure that by pigging on a =
two or three week cycle the eff. of the lateral can be maintained to accept=
able levels we may be able to postpone the DRA application until after Tarr=
iff months (July & Aug.).  Once through the hot tariff months we have an op=
portunity to make it through the remainder of the year.  $320,000 is on the=
 table for this project and that's why we really need to take whatever step=
s are necessary to delay as long as we do not jeopardize throughput....

Rick and I would be appreciate hearing your view points or concerns with th=
is plan but, in the mean time the following actions need to be taken:

1)  Send a sample of liquids and/or solids from the last pig run to Ben Asa=
nte for analysis.  (Gallup Team)

2)  Send a sample of solids from the inlet of Bloomfield to Ben Asante for =
analysis.  (San Juan Team)  This sample may have to come from a seal gas fi=
lter or fuel gas filter or???  Let me know if there are problems collecting=
 a sample in the next few days and we will put our heads togeather)

3)  Start pigging on a two week cycle.  Darryl S. agreed on the conf. call =
to take whatever steps are necessary to work with everyone on the pigging. =
 Please do not exceed 15 days between pig runs.  (Gallup and San Juan Teams=
)

4)  Collect valve data on the same cylcle time as the pig runs whenever man=
power and/or work loads permit.  (Gallup and San Juan Teams)

5)  Collect a sample of the liquids in the tank at Gallup and send in to Ti=
m Sweeny for analysis.  (Will you need to stir the tank before this is done=
?)  The reason for this step is we may have the opportunity to re-use the o=
ld DRA.  (Gallup Team)  Rick, you may want to contact Tim and insure he can=
 run this analysis for us.  (713-569-7973)  By the way, how many gallons do=
 we have in the tank at Gallup?  We will need 4000 to 5000 for a reapplicat=
ion...

6)  If the sample of the old DRA at Gallup determines that the solution is =
not fit for furhter use, work with Larry Campbell on disposing and insure t=
he tank is available for a May/June timeframe of re-applying the DRA.  (Gal=
lup Team)

7)  Gear up for an May/June timeframe to reapply the DRA if necessary.  (Ga=
llup and San Juan Teams)  Get togeather and pick two or three dates that wi=
ll work for you all and let Rick and I know.

8)  Currently all the project dollars reside in the San Juan Team's plan.  =
Advisors need to get with Vera and determine what distribution needs to mad=
e of those dollars to the Gallup Teams plan to insure overages are covered.=

The best I could do was the Cypress course at 10:00 am Monday, January 21.  The Creek course was booked unitl later.  Didn't want to tee off too late.  Unless they lied to me, the fee plus cart is $36.

Ce ya there.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

    On 3/23/02, Helen called the on-call for Tescott concerning a hi gas detection
    alarm she'd received at the station. Gary went out to check the alarm and found
    out that the pre-lube oil pump on unit 5, which is gas powered, was leaking which 
    caused the alarm. Parts for this unit may not be available until next Monday which,
    in turn, means unit 5 will be unavailable until then. Gary confered with Kim on this
    and relayed to us that if any compression is needed on the high side unit 3 is ready
    and can be switched over for us at any time.

I just spoke to my tech, Joe Martinez out of Pampa, and he says Oneok/Energas has installed a new meter at the Horn McClure 0006510.  Do you know anything of this? We need to set it up and he needs a POI.  The number I will give it is 0006509 but I will need other info if you can locate it for me. This meter started taking gas the 31st of October, 2001. We have the on reading and the current off read so all gas should be accounted and go into Feb. data if possible. Thanks for any assistance...sig

We will continue monitoring the A line H2O reading at Sublette which is now reading approximately 13.8 pounds of water. This is the H2O content of the Haskell and Sublette field after it has been dehyed.  It is important to remember that the A line is discharged into the B Line suction thus the H20 is being blended down to 1 pound.  If you have any questions call me or the Sublette Team.

Disregard Sublette's A-line H20 readings at register# 7079. Scott at Sublette station is having George Marshall remove it from the system. Sublette is not flowing up the A-line anymore. We need to continue to focus on the B-line moisture.

Have not heard of any problems for switching Lyons to Bushton recompress, so it is planned to make the switch.  But the Bushton Treater inlet filters have developed high differential and are being changed today.  So the plan is to make the switch tomorrow, Tuesday, 01/15/02.

Thanks,

Subject:	Lyons Withdrawal Switch to Recompress Suction

Please let me know if you see any problems with switching the Lyons withdrawal volumes to the Bushton recompress suction on Monday, 01/14/02.

Lyons has been free flowing into the Bushton C north, but there is desire to lower the pressure on the field.  Switching to the recompress suction should lower the Lyons pressure to the 550 PSIG or less range.

The people I've talked to so far see it as a good deal.  If I don't hear of any problems I will talk to Gas Control on Monday and make the change.

Thanks,


John

I have purchased external charges for your Blackberrys.  This will allow charging away from desktop or laptop, away from the cradle.
 
I would estimate you will have about 3-4 days away from your desktop/laptop (no charging) with normal usage. 
 
Thanks.  Jean

We are willing to sit at the table and negotiate.  SADIST has pushed us to the brink!  We have infiltrated the SADIST camp and know are in possession of a toaster, AND blender.  We have joined sides with EPLF to demand that our paper supply stays in high demand.  If our demands are not met by the end of today, we will be forced to sign over all our Enron stock options to your organization.  This will cause your organization to implode!!

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)

away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.
Donna Scott is working with the mail room. 

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

	Tnx, Alma G.

Effective January 1, 2002, the set point for Eagle flow controller should be set at 69,000 (There is no change from December, however November set point was 67,000).

Please note the flow control may be changed any day during the month when a Daily TFX is contracted to Eagle and/or Mukwanogo.  A revised set point will be communicated to Gas Control when a Daily TFX is tendered.

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

Subject:	San Juan Lateral Pigging

 		


The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat

Disregard Sublette's A-line H20 readings at register# 7079. Scott at Sublette station is having George Marshall remove it from the system. Sublette is not flowing up the A-line anymore. We need to continue to focus on the B-line moisture.

Attached is the dollar value calculation for the TW/NGPL obas for the period May 1, 2001 through October 16, 2001.  Utilizing the Permian Basin/Panhandle index prices, the dollar values are:

Winkler oba  -   $  71,352.31  due Transwestern
Gray oba      -   $298,286.08  due Transwestern

 






The volume balances for the obas as of 4/30/01 are:

Winkler oba - 19,800 mmbtus due Transwestern
Gray oba     - 37,185 mmbtus due Transwestern

These volumes represent the agreed to balances which had been previously reconciled and agreed upon.  These volumes can be 
resolved by either cash out, physical payback, or they can be valued and included with the above dollar values.  Please call me at 713-853-6709 to discuss these options.  

thanks

Kevin, Here is the revised list from Shelley's team. They have substituted a number of folks.

Darrell, Tim, Dannis, Terry, Gary,  Please provide Kevin Dumas with your home phone and address so he can determine if the service is available for you. Once we know what service is available for each of you, we will confirm approval to proceed, and then move forward.

Mike, We will need charge codes for all of Shelley's staff.

Gary

Gary,

Please see the attached xls for cost related to; 	

  	 adjusted monthly reoccurring fees  
	 installation fees
	cost of an IP enabled NEC phone

Before I can order these circuits, I need to know the charge codes for each new user and your point person to work with IPNet on each installation.  

Please confirm that each user shown in the xls, does want the IP phone option. This will bring use to 32 IP-phones in service through the Ardmore switch.  The over subscription issue will be resolved in 45 -65 days. The cost does represent the addition of a second T1 into Ardmore.

Don, Don, & Bob, 
IPNet can only provide T1 service to your homes @ a base fee of $315 monthly. I assumed that you do not want to fund that amount. If this is incorrect, please let me know.

If you have any questions, please call me.

This outage was move up from 10/25/01 to 10/2. The  outage will last from 10/02 to 10/08. We wanted to get this done earlier in the month. This is a Platteville Team outage, but the pressure reduction on the B/L is controlled by the Owatonna Team. See the details below, and the contact people.

Tomah Valve #4 replacement.  Install new valve setting 11901-BYB04 @ the Sparta Takeoff. Stopple fittings will be installed upstream and downstream of BV BYB04 and a 4" temp.bypass fab. & installed. Reduce pressure for excavation to 65% maop (520 psig) regulated at LaCrescent during stopple ops.

Most of you already know but to update the rest.  

Disasembly took place today in IRS's Farmington shop.  Brian Dils was on location as the company representative.  The stator has failed and taken the laminations out.  The rotor has one pole that has failed as well.  

Looking at approximately 6 to 8 weeks to turn around, from the time a purchase order is issued.  Cost for rebuild only is approximately $470K.  This was (according to IRS) a major failure.  Does not include cost already incurred for removal and cost that will be required for reinstallation.  

A recommended scope of work and a detailed cost estimate will be provided by IRS within the next day or so.  Hopefully in time for the next conf. call.

Conf. call 3/19/02 Tuesday 3:00 pm CST (2:00 MST) will be held to update.  877-795-3687  pin 552068

The motor is on a trailer and will be on the road before nightfall.  Disassembly will begin either Sunday or Monday morning.  (Brandy Jones, shop foreman for IRS, indicated it would be more like Monday.)  The team will have a rep on site for disassembly and Todd Ingalls along with Brian Dills will be in discussions with IRS so that an update is available for Monday afternoons conf. call.  

The San Juan Team has done an excellant job in expediting this removal.  

Questions up to this point?  Please let me know.  Thanks

Contractors are on location and making good progress this morning.  The heavy iron used to skid the motor in position for a lift through the ceiling is being transported from the San Juan Station.  Motor wiring disconnects have been completed.   The roof is being removed and the crane should be on location this evening.  IRS has sub-ed Foutz and Bursham for necessary welding, support personnel and some heavy equipment.    The compressor coupling has not yet been disconnected as one final runout will be taken per IRS's request.  Exhaust ducting has been removed and will have to be shipped in for repairs.  (the foam material sprayed in the duct has burned and will need to be replaced)  

Now anticipating a lift sometime tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow evening, if all continues to move along as well as it has to this point.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As of the 6th TW and NNG are balanced, I agree with Gary we need to stay balanced.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

	In verifying IT point contract data this Sunday after our implementation, we came across some point differences in old system to new system. Looks like possible displacement points for interruptible contracts. Should the points listed below be valid displacement points for Interruptible contracts? Please let me know ASAP on Monday.

Thanks Ramona

Darrell,

Ben at Conoco would like to know the answers to the questions listed below. His 3rd question below, I think he means 705,000 instead of 205,000.

Thanks,

Tracy

Tracy,

Can you please help me with the following?

What is the total capacity for the San Juan lateral?
What is the total capacity for the Mainline West of Thoreau?
On April 2 the Ignacio to Blanco line is going from 705,000 to 0 with La Plata dropping 500,000 through April 5.  When does the 205,000 come back online?

Thank you,
Ben

It has come to my attention that the Richardson PNR rate was less than previously reported....It also gave me an opportunity to corrected a mathematical error in my original e-mail.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

The floor meeting with Stan Horton on this afternoon is expected to end at 2:30p.  We expect that it will not interfere with Steve Harris' scheduled Staff Meeting.  Should it go over, we would like to convene immediately following or at 3:00p.

All reports should be abbreviated to accommodate the shorten scheduled.

Thanks in advance,

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 21
>From 5:00 - 7:30 p.m., the Corporate Unix team will perform maintenance on dns1-corp.  Dns1-corp is the primary dns server for enron.com domain.  Queries to enron.com domain will be forwarded to dns2-corp which is the secondary dns server.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
>From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Messaging team will update the virus engine on Mailsweeper servers. This will be done on a monthly basis for better protection against new viruses.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
>From 8:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 23
>From 5:00 p.m. through 3/24 at 7:00 a.m., the Envision system will be taken offline to perform backups.  Users will not be able to access information located on Envision during this maintenance.
Mar. 25
>From 9:00 a.m. through 4/5 at 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will make WINS/DNS changes on all servers to reflect the new server settings.  Devices that require a reboot will be submitted via a separate change control.   Some impact may occur during these changes and that information will be forwarded as it becomes available.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.  
Future Changes:
ENS backbone will be upgrading the code on the floor switches in the very near future.  Individual companies will be contacted as the floors are scheduled.  This will result in network outages for ETS and will be coordinated with ENS.

The testing process now includes the Flow Gas app.  All testing was completed successfully, and we have confirmed with ENW Resolution Center that Exchange servers are up.  We experienced performance issues for two brief periods with Exchange servers 1 and 3 this week.  Although the ENW Resolution Center has provided no detail, we are following up with the Messaging team.

The valve that we open/close for the Mitchell Ellenburger plant is not working properly.  If we need to shut-in the flow from the plant, we will have to make a call out.  Al Haney is aware of the problem and will let us know when it is repaired.

It's time to start thinking about when and where we can get together to
review the maintenance that will affect the San Juan area this year.  The
EPNG planners will have their information from the field, and we will review
it internally by the middle of February.  Can we look at late Feb or early
March?

We did not decide who would host this year's meeting when we departed last
year.  If anyone wants to volunteer, please say so.  We could consider
meeting at a neutral location (Las Vegas has been suggested).

I will coordinate our communications until someone volunteers to take the
ball.  Please e-mail your thoughts.

Thanks,

FYI,

Due to several schedule conflicts, the Fall Links Meeting will be moved to the spring of 2002. So, I guess it will be the Spring Links Meeting. Most likely it will be in late February or early March. We still plan on having it in Tulsa, and I will give more details as the time frame gets closer. Sorry for the change in plans.

Attention everybody! It's getting to be that time of year again. Time for the Fall Links Meeting. Last year we held it in Amarillo. Fred, and Randy did an excellent job hosting the show for us. This year Jerry Knight & Delaine Kurth with Oneok have agreed to host it in Tulsa. The meeting will be on November 15. Once Jerry puts together the details we will forward them to you.(Hotel, location, and directions). Please let me know if you can attend, so we can get a head count. I'm putting together some agenda items here in the next week or so, please seed me anything you would like to see on the agenda. Give me a call if you have questions.

Thank you

3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=

ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

This is the same schedule posted on the bulletin board by your mailboxes. I think this was just a courtesy reminder of the 2002 holidays.  The discretionary holiday does not appear on this e-mail but it is still valid.  This is also posted on the regular HR website on the intranet.  If you check eHRonline where you find your vacation totals, your discretionary holiday entitlement for 2002 does appear.

Darrell called and informed us that there is a turbine down at the Fullerton Plant POI 36511.  For the Gas Day of 10/17 we will need to  confirm down the location to 18,000 dth.  Darrell is changing the capacity for the Gas Day of the 18th through the weekend. We have contacted the operator and we are expecting a call back to instruct us for Gas Day 10/17 confirmations. We need ensure that the gas remains confirmed down through the ID2 cycle. 

If you have any questions please contact either Cara (5-2871) or Chris (3-4826)

Max,
I will try to make the conference call, but not sure I can.  My father-in-law passed away last night and I'll be in the Wichita Falls area tomorrow.  If I can't make it I'll try to call you before hand. 
Thanks, Arnie

Please read the comments below, and then let Darrell or I know if this sounds acceptable you. Please note the MAOP set points and the shut down timing scenario. I have them highlighted in red below.

Subject:	RE: Set points

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

Jerry,
I talked to Ronnie Morse, and he says the outage at Station 4 is scheduled to be completed 5-3.  They will then send equipment in to be repaired or rebuilt and then returned to Station 6.  Am attaching outage request and if there are any questions, please call or e-mail. 
Thanks,

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Subject:	Toaster

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!  

EPLF -- you're TOAST!!!!!

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Subject:	Exposed A- Line

We are planning on a full remediation to the exposed A-line near Englewood Ks. this Friday October 26th.  Because this exposed line is in a flowing creek we are applying for a permit to the KDHE to permanately repair the area using a weir to maintain cover for the pipeline.  

The permit takes about 60 days to process but we have asked for a temporary repair because of the operational impact to our system.  The KDHE has agreed to allow the temporary repair until we have received our permit.  After the permit is received we will install our final weir using steel sheet piling and should not have any disruption to service when we do this. 

Sorry for the delay in getting the A-line back in full service but we wanted to ensure that we met all regulatory requirements and were prudent in our repair cost.  If all goes well we should be able to remove the operating restriction from the A-line this Friday.  If you have any questions please let me know.  later dn

Well my plan lasted about 30 minutes.

I had missed that Clifton unit 32 has been mothballed.  It is in a preserve=
d state, requiring an estimated 12 hours to place it back in service.

Not running Clifton unit 32 would probably lower the B line throughput by a=
bout 70 MM/D.  Some of that 70 MM/D could be made up on the C and D in the =
configuration below.  My suggestion is for Gas Control to make a decision W=
ednesday morning if the unit will be needed for the Thursday cold weather.

Please let me know of any better ideas.

Subject:=09Beaver to Bushton configuration without the Bushton turbine

Below is a system configuration I was asked to put together to flow 1600 MM=
/D through Clifton without the Bushton turbine.

A system weighted temperature of 29 F is forecasted for Thursday (vs 49 F n=
ormal) and the Bushton turbine is not scheduled to be back in-service until=
 11/01/01.  A 29 F temperature is not so cold per say, but north sources su=
ch as Trailblazer (240 MM/D), Carlton (50 MM/D) and Redfield (on injection)=
 are still in the summer mode.  This could result in a high rate through Cl=
ifton.

75 - 100 Trailblazer flowing to the B discharge.  Palmyra compressing three=

THIS MEANS?

Be sure that the required units are ready to run.  If not, let me and Gas C=

It is very important that we check our order sheets after each nom cycle against what is actually flowing at our receipt and delivery points. If there are points flowing without an order or not flowing with an order, find out what the reason is, and don't believe what the plant guy says. Check with the scheduler, they are here until after 10 pm each night. Report problems to Gary or myself. We have had some situations recently where gas flowed for several shifts without an order, and that is tough to explain in our meetings with Marketing. Check flows and orders frequently. thanks. sj

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

Darrell called and informed us that there is a turbine down at the Fullerton Plant POI 36511.  For the Gas Day of 10/17 we will need to  confirm down the location to 18,000 dth.  Darrell is changing the capacity for the Gas Day of the 18th through the weekend. We have contacted the operator and we are expecting a call back to instruct us for Gas Day 10/17 confirmations. We need ensure that the gas remains confirmed down through the ID2 cycle. 

If you have any questions please contact either Cara (5-2871) or Chris (3-4826)

Thanks.

Houston Astros Baseball season tickets are available sale to employees at their face value.  The seats range in price from $2,490 to $3,237 for the season, and are located in the box and club levels. 

If you're interested in being on the list of potential buyers for Enron's season tickets to the Astro's 2002 home games, please indicate your interest by 4PM, Central Time on Thursday, March 21 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined, we'll know whether a lottery process will need to take place to fairly allocate the purchase opportunities and will communicate that to respondents.

ID2:		The streak of non-variances ended tonight.  One variance was intentional, but the other was not.  In any case I had to
		manually schedule volumes at Transcolorado and Northwest for Sempra's CR 27848 and 27342, respectively due to 
		downstream confirmation cuts.
	
EVE:		All the points looked okay with the minor exception of Transcolorado.

OTHER:	The Force Majeure at Bisti looks like it will continue for 5 to 6 weeks.  Since San Juan will likely be cut every cycle,
		we need to allocate the NGPL points, Gray, Eddy, and Winkler even if San Juan does not appear on the original 			allocation list.  By allocating these points, the bogus volume at Northwest delivery will disappear, and then San Juan 		should come up for allocation.  I learned this the hard way by ignoring those points on the ID2 cycle for 3/15.  I knew 		the Enserco volumes were not going to be confirmed, but the delivery at Northwest over-inflated the deliveries at San 			Juan and should have been allocated.  The net effect was San Juan scheduled over 842,000 even though Darrell had 			the capacity at 800,000.

		For the good news, Joe Hoang recached our batch printer options so now the "J" printer at 3920 is usable.


See you later,  Bert

FYI,

Cooper pulled the header off unit 761 to try and realign everything. They found the header was warped and had to be set in a gig, and re-worked. The new estimated completion is 1/15/02. The team said they would contact Agave.

I just finished talking to Bill. He said that his brother Louis is not giving up and neither ae the doctors. Bill said that Louis can hear them talk to him and that he responds to feel, though Louis is still in critical condition. Bill said that the Lubbock Fire Department has been very supportive with food and beverages. I ask that your thoughts and prayers be with the " Jones" family and we will keep you all updated as time goes by. Bill also said that visitation to see Louis has been very limited.   


Food For Thought-------Some jobs treaten or take our retirements, and some jobs treaten or take our lives. Now that we know, the kind of cards that life can deal to 
us, ask yourself how lucky do you feel.

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Progra=
mmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the=
 stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is t=
he last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are how=
ever, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we r=
equire to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking=
 the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you =
documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering=
 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=
rinters?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements=
 surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  Wha=
t other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically includ=
ed in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and=
 will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=
ks of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola=
, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that =
they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toas=
ter without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use i=
t. =20

Attached is PPL's gas nomination for tomorrow. Please note we are requesting a

As of the 6th TW and NNG are balanced, I agree with Gary we need to stay balanced.

Ben, we  had discussions with Citizens this morning concerning the Griffith interconnect.  Citizens has requested that we modify our controls so that we convert to a pressure control system with flow over-ride capability.  Obviously the pressure control setpoint would need to be a variable with setpoint change capablity from Houston.  Gary Choquette can provide more specific details is you should need to discuss.  Mark McConnell will be coordinating arrangements to facilitate a re-imbursement (by Citizens to TW) for time, traveling expenses & material.  We will wait on these arrangements by Mark to be concluded prior to moving forward.  For now, we have tentatively committed to having these modifications implemented by the end of the 2nd or 3rd week of January.  (Does this time frame pose any problem for you?)  Scott Hill and Russ Ulibarri will be the contacts in the field.  

Should anyone have questions or concerns, please give me a call.  Thanks....

Has anyone got a drawing or sketch of the Citizens Plant Station?  To me, it sounds like they picked the wrong type of control valve (for the noise issue).

Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation.  Please note Rob's message.  
Gary will you and Tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we 
think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the Citizens site.  The call will include all
the above personnel.  After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything
TW can or is willing to do, or is it a Citizens design problem.
I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday.  I will be on vacation tomorrow.

Thanks DS

Bisti unit went down at 1415 on 03/14/2002 unit BSD not an ESD. There was no evidence of a fire
so the Team reset the fire eyes and tried to start the unit back up. The unit failed to start because the
units PLC ( processor ) went out. After trying to fix it and to no avail it was decided to send for a new one 
at Bloomfiled. After the team installed the new and tried to start the unit it was evident the new one was
bad also. So we tried to track down Solar for advice. All there reps are in Wyoming, So we talk to a 
few of there specialist and they said we needed a new PLC. Keep in mind by now it's midnight PLC are
 hard to find late at night so we called a few good friends  ( Northwest Pipeline ) and located one in Colorado.
 After we got it to Bisti, It was installed and the unit came right on line just to have another BSD still no avidence
 of a fire but this time the winding temps on the unit were over 400 hundred degrees, Shut downs at 250 so the
 team began to trouble shoot the problem it was decided to us one of the spare wires in the winding box and see 
what would happen

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Bruce says parts (guide vain) should be in tomorrow and if so, they would have them by 1500.  The starters that are coming in from Kermit might not be in until Saturday.

I tried putting Hugo on this morning and it didn't start.  Bruce Pals and Mark Rinke have been trying to get the unit on line and it is unavailable.  The guide vain actuator came apart and the controller and 2 starters now have to be replaced.

Units 1 & 5 at the Hugoton Plant are not sending a shut down status to the Auto Dialer to automatically call the Team pager. If either of these units shut down during the night, you will have to call OCC. (Until they fix the problem.)

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

I have checked on the status of the 's after the move and they play a critical role in our communication plan if the Lucent phones are down.  (Big backhoes can dig ditches and accidentally cut cables as we have seen in the past.)  The 's  are outside of our current Lucent phone switch and give us
the ability to make outside calls.  

Currently 's  are located and connected correctly at the following locations:
	John Buchanan  EBN4270
	Pat Barry  EBN4279
	Tracy Minter EBN3979  

But, we need additional 's  installed at the following locations:
	Terry Kowalke  EBN3972
	Jack Howard EBN3910E
	Sherry Forbish EBN4275A

This will accommodate Gas Logistics interim phone coverage plan between moves.  Please check to determine if the cost of these additional installations were included in the regular move schedule.  If you have any questions, please advise.  We will place a ' at the reconnection site.  
Thanks for you assistance.

Just a note to let you know how the Focus Group meeting went last Friday....

There were approximately 10 employees and two HR facilitating the meeting and taking notes. All but two were from outside the P/L Group. As I understand it, the group I was in was one of several groups HR met with on Friday. The meeting lasted an hour.  The group was asked for their opinions and observations through a series of questions. Some of the questions were as follows.....I didn't take notes so the questions below may not be worded exactly as asked but are similar.....  

What should happen to Enron's Management? Should any be retained or should the Enron start fresh with new management team. What about Board of Directors?

Enron had a set of values according to which it professed to operate....Which values should be retained and which discontinued?

What does Enron need to provide in order to retain its employees? What gauge should be used to evaluate improvement over the next 6 to 12 months? 

Communication has been raised as an issue in other groups. What information and what is the best means to communicate to employees?

There was a lot of venting in the group. People were angry and wanted answers to their concerns. There were no answers offered by HR to any issues and/or concerns raised by the group. HR just took note of what was discussed.  

HR did indicate that more meeting will be held in the future.

FYI....

I have been asked to be part of a Focus Group on Enron. As I understand it,  HR is facilitating the effort to seek out employee attitudes and ideas. I don't have a lot of the particulars  but I thought it is an opportunity for me to represent any of the feelings and ideas you might have but don't know who to tell.... i.e.; what's going right or wrong and ideas on how things could be improved. I'll keep your comments confidential.
If you would add your thoughts to the discussion, drop me a note, call me or stop by and tell me.
I'll report back to y'all after the meeting...which is today at 3:00 p.m.
Thanks.....
Mike

p.s.....In my haste, I know I left some people off this e-mail.....Please pass the message to anyone you think might be interested.

	In verifying IT point contract data this Sunday after our implementation, we came across some point differences in old system to new system. Looks like possible displacement points for interruptible contracts. Should the points listed below be valid displacement points for Interruptible contracts? Please let me know ASAP on Monday.

Thanks Ramona

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
>From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
>From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

ETS Solution Center - Houston, at 713-345-4745

I called Steve Richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use.  I told him to get started.
This is for unit 602 down from 1/16 to 5/31.  We will still have two units available.

Gary, I called ANR Gas Control, their compressor was down four hours at Janesville for the gas day ending 01/08/02.  Also discovered they are using a different btu at Janesville, ANR btu is 1.002 and our is 1.008.  Contacted Sandy Meyers to have btu corrected at Janesville.

ID2:		Had to manually schedule Northwest CR 20786/24954, PNM CR 20785/25397, and TW CR 22948 because the receipt 		points were considered invalid.  The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the 		Northwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central 		pools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at 		Socal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio 			Puerco 	and Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.

		I had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and 			Mojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to 			938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.

EVE:		Had to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin 			contract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on 		cycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if 		they did schedule on the Evening.

NON-GRID:	Confirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying 		to fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for 			the South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through 			22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the 		system didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.

If you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

FYI,

Here's the latest information on these two turbines.

Bushton Turbine - Maximum Turbine should be on site Wednesday 10/24/01 to set unit 25 at Bushton. Unit 25 is the unit they got from Mullinville. They need to get it in place, put the insulation on, and reinstall the controls. 11/01/01 is still the best date they could give me. 

Mullinville #26 - The run testing they did last week went well. They got some good data. There are still a couple of problems they are looking into. One of them is the unit won't run up to speed. The Maximum Turbine guys are schedule to head there as soon as the leave Bushton on 11/01/01.

Rodney called to check in.  He did got to the doctor last week and got things fixed up.  Tomorrow he will go in for more testing for anymore leaks and then on Friday he actually sees the doctor to review all of the information from the tests with him.  Rodney indicated he's feeling much better but  just has no idea of when he'll be coming back.

Talked to Rodney.  He came home late Friday afternoon.  Recovery is very slow.  He had some trouble with some IV medication, causing heaving, causing a few broken stitches.  He goes back to the doctor tomorrow. Physical progress is slow, spirits are a little down naturally.  He felt like he was so close to coming back and then another setback. I'll keep you posted.

Rodney had his surgery last week. They went in and patched another fissure in his stomach.  The following day they took him back into surgery and removed his spleen.  I did talk to him this afternoon so at least he didn't have a trach but was on the ventilator for awhile.  He said he feels better this time around in his recovery.  He said the doctor would wait for a couple of more days before they run tests to check for anymore leaks (pretty much like hydrotesting he said).  Keep Rodney in your prayers.  Once again:

Subject:	RE: 9/18 - Update - Rodney Barnes

I called and talked to Rodney yesterday.  He's was doing pretty good.  Can walk about a block before he tires.  Also can tie his shoes now which though pretty simple it was not something he could do when he first go home, retrained the thumb muscles.  He lost weight, down to 161.  Can't eat much at one sitting but eats about 6 small meals a day.  He had wanted to try to come back on his set of nights this week but his doctor had some concern over more drainage.  They ran tests and he was waiting for the doctor to call him back.  

Steve January got a call yesterday evening from Rodney saying the doctor found another small hole in his stomach.  He was scheduled to go back to the hospital last night for an additional surgery to repair this.  Naturally Rodney was a little down about this since he had made so much progress.  I'll keep you posted.

Rodney is finally home!! He called in and visited with me before lunch. His trach is now out but he still has to hook at an IV with antibiotics 3-4 times a day at least for another month.  He finds it hard to believe that he has to use a walker to get around in his own house. Even has to have therapy for his thumbs since they didn't move, can't even tear a piece of paper.  He said he's glad we saved him a spot and didn't give up on him..

Really good news... Rodney called in yesterday.  He's in rehab and still has his trach but able to talk.  Sounded good and very happy to be talking to anybody considering what he's been through.  He commented on how he almost didn't make it.  Should be in rehab another week and then hopefully he thinks he'll be able to go home.

Pretty good news - Rodney is finally on the mend.  The one thing they discovered that the fungal infection that he had was resistent to the antibiotic they had him on, got that changed and he started to turn around.  He's still has the trach in but is off the ventilator, still in ICU.  Martha said he will probably go to a rehabilitation facility next week.  He's been laying so long he'll have to learn amoungst other things how to walk again.

Rodney had the tracheotomy yesterday and things went real well.  Breathing a lot easier but not totally off the ventilator yet.  Already feels better when he's awake, still sleeps a lot because of medication.  He will have to do rehab with his  breathing and somewhat with his walking since he's been down so long.  I'll keep you posted.

Just visited with Martha.  Things are a little bit better. Rodney is still on the ventilator. They delayed doing a tracheotomy but will do so probably tomorrow.  It's easier to wean him off the ventilator this way.  Martha said he's looking much better.  His blood pressure is more stable.  When he's awake he will wink and nod at her so he understands what she's saying.  So this is a big step up from where he was last week.

Subject:	RE: 7/25 Update - Rodney Barnes


I called the hospital this morning.  Rodney is still in ICU.  I called the house to visit with Martha to get an update. She was asleep but an aunt at the house indicated there is not much change in Rodney's condition.  He still on the respirator and mostly sedated.  Said he will open his eyes but doesn't seem to recognize anyone.

Subject:	RE: 7/19  Update - Rodney Barnes

I talked to Rodney's wife this morning.  He had the surgery on Monday, quite bit more extensive than they had planned.  There was a lot of internal infection.  He is still in ICU and on a respirator.  They hope to start weaning him off the respirator soon.  Just keep Rodney in your thoughts and prayers.

Subject:	RE: 7/12 Update - Rodney Barnes

Rodney's wife called this morning to update us.  He will be having surgery Monday or Tuesday to repair the perforation in his stomach.  The tests they did earlier this week revealed that it was not healing.  He can't eat or drink anything, nourishment through an IV only since nothing will stay in his stomach.  Doctor is trying to get his albumin level (amino acids) up before doing surgery since this aids the healing process.  Martha will call and let me know when surgery is actually scheduled.

I visited with Rodney's wife this morning.  He is still in the hospital.  There is a problem with a perforation sealing properly.  The doctors will be doing some tests today to see if things are progressing or if they need to do something different.  I'll keep you updated.

Hello,

I spoke with Martha, Rodney's wife tonight. Rodney was moved from the ICU unit today and into a regular room.  He is in Houston Northwest Hospital, room 476.  She is expecting him to remain in the hospital for another week.  I let her know that they are in our thoughts and prayers.

I have set up POI 78269 for this fuel delivery. I need someone to provide the following information in order to complete setup of the POI.

Is the West Texas Supply basin correct?
Is the East of Thoreau Area correct?
Should the point have GRI yes or no?
What is the Lateral ID to be used?
What is the Marketing Lateral ID to be used?

Thanks

When we slow Gallup down or take it down to avoid the electric peaks, please log it.  This will help the field to keep 
track of the days and give Rich Jolly and David Roensch (Tiny) the information they may need to answer questions.
Your help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks DS

FYI,

Per Mike Burnam, and Chuck Good unit 26 needs to be overhauled. They will start on it 10/22/01 and the estimated completion date is 12/17/01. (8 weeks) Unit 27 is running fine at present time so there is know flow impact. Keep your fingers crossed.

Jerry

Jerry,
  With the changes we have made in the scope of work for station 4 we would like to change the start up date back to April 1, 2002. The additional time is needed to gather the measurement and to build the custom bearing for unit 401. 

Ronnie.......

Jerry,  What is the D/R?  May 15 is a conflict with our Gallup ESD.  How
long will you be down, and can move that to May 9, 10, or another date that
shows no scheduled maintenance on this calendar?

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

Wrenshall is continuing liquefaction and should be at full inventory in early February.  

Garner's York compressor is down.  On Monday they will decide how to proceed.  If they send the unit into the factory, then the current inventory of 1.75 Bcf will be the max for this heating season.

There may have been some misinformation that the minimum order for vaporization at the LNG tanks is 100 mmcfd.  In talking to the LNG operators they say that the following are minimum orders for vaporization:

Wrenshall  -  50 mmcfd

Garner       -  40 mmcfd

This is not the most effiicent operation for their units, but it is manageable.  

The utilization of the SBA Peakers at Carlton can be balanced with the use of Wrenshall LNG as a backstop.  On days when calling SBA Peakers 24 hours in advance is a borderline decision, it may be best to wait and use LNG if the situation warrants it.   In any case, the utilization of Wrenshall is encouraged, to allow them some run time.  Utilization of Wrenshall may be possible more often if the volume coming in is 50 mmcfd rather than 100 mmcfd.

This looks good to me.  If you don't have any issues with this we will proceed.  Comments?

Yes, I forgot to get back with you on this.  Jon Hendricks, Scott Hill and myself got together last week and thought this might be a good approach.

The control system does pretty good with control of the units until they get down to minimum speed and that is where we get into problems.  If we get over 1010 psi on the mainline or 2psi over maop on any system we will look at the governor speed and if it is not at minimum we will speed up the process trying to get back to maop.

If we are over 2psi (.2%) and at minimum speed for 2 minutes we will take one unit off line and wait for 5 minutes to see if we need to repeat this and take off another unit.  At anytime if we hit 1015 or 7psi (.7%)over maop we will keep the station shutdown and all units will go down.
1015 is where we will have the pressure switches will be set.  I feel that we should be comfortable with these numbers as we will not ever get over 1% of maop unless we have a failure of the system and at this point the relief valves will protect us.  We will have to have several failures for this to occur.

If you feel that this is a good plan please let me know and we will come up with the programming to make it happen.
We can start implementing this right away and should be able to get it done by the end of the year.  We would  be quicker but we seem to have a lot going on right now.

Thanks
Todd

The data coming back from the RTU at Maple Lake # 1 , MN is incorrect. They are having problems with the phone line and are planning repairs when the ground thaws out enough so it can be replaced. For the time being, all the necessary data has been put on chart recorders. I inhibited the RTU to take it out of scan.

Any questions contact: Jim Nelson / Willmar Team

 19 THINGS THAT IT  TOOK ME 50 YEARS TO LEARN by Dave Barry 
 1. Never under any  circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on 
the same night.  
 2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race  has 
 not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that  word would 
be "meetings." 
 3. There is a very fine line  between "hobby" and "mental illness." 
 4. People who want to share  their religious views with you almost never 
want you to share yours  with them. 
 5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all  of its glories, 
 decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT  use, As His 
 messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.  
 6. You should not confuse your career with your life. 
 7. No  matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too  
 seriously. 
 8. When trouble arises and things look bad, there  is always one Individual 
 who perceives a solution and is willing to  take command. Very often, that 
 individual is crazy. 
 9.  Nobody cares if you cannot dance well. Just get up and dance. 
 10.  Never lick a steak knife. 
 11. Take out the fortune before you eat the  cookie. 
 12. The most powerful force in the universe is gossip.  
 13. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and  compelling 
 reason why we observe daylight savings time. 
 14.  You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests  
 that you think she is pregnant unless you can see an actual baby  emerging 
 from her at that moment. 
 15. There comes a time  when you should stop expecting other people to make 
a big deal about your  birthday. That time is age eleven. 
16. The one thing that unites all human  beings, regardless of age, gender, 
 religion, economic status or ethnic  background, is that, deep down inside, 
 we ALL believe that we are  above average drivers. 
 17. The main accomplishment of almost all  organized protests is to annoy 
 people who are not in them. 
18. A  person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.  
 19. Your friends love you anyway.

A new change control has been added...

Mar. 22
>From 5:00 - 7:00 p.m., the EDI team will migrate the ECNET server from the 172.28.176.249 network.  This migration will cause a total outage for the ECNET server.  Applications accessing this device via IP address will need to be changed to reflect the new IP which is 172.16.2.22.  The EDINET server at 172.28.176.21 will also be migrated the week of Apr. 6.  More information regarding that change will be available next week.

I have a couple of questions Jerry, however I think they would  be easier to discuss over the phone.  I will  be back in the office next week so maybe we can hook up.

FYI,

Hey guys the attached report has the outages related to the Red Rock expansion. I asked Ron, if you guys could take a look at the estimated flow affect you see in the highlighted boxes. The reason is, because I moved unit 401's overhaul into March. The same time period we are doing the tie-ins for Station 1 & 3. The hope is to reduce the total throughput loss, and also reduce the down time. I talked with Jan Moore and told her there will probably be a modification of the affected flows.

Thanks

Jerry

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn

Subject:	Bisti Replacement Motor Update" 

We informed Ideal Electric this afternoon to start work on the Bisti replacement motor.  Josh Mayes has contacted Andrew Gagnon at Ideal with the P.O. information.  We were able to negotiate a three year warranty with the 6 week delivery.  Price will be $295,000 with a reduction in price of $30,000 to $35,000 if we can reuse the existing rotor and/or parts from the previously installed rotor.  We will need to ship the entire motor except for the top hat enclosure and the rotor at Roswell to Ideal.

Todd or Tiny, please ship the motor and spare rotor to Ideal Electric Company, 330 E. First Street, Mansfield, OH,  44902  Attn:  Andrew Gagnon, phone 419-522-3611.

Sarabeth or Josh,  please contact Ideal for a long term service contract.  Dan Pribble would like to know what this cost would be and he will decide if this option should be pursued.

Arnold, please send Andy at Ideal the information you have on the Gallup motor.  

Ideal is checking on the cost of a spare motor which would be good for both Bloomfield and Bisti.  Depending on what the Gallup specifications are, Ideal might be able to make the spare motor good for all three installations.  

We have informed Mark Knippa with ECS that due to the emergency situation that TW is leading the efforts to get Bisti back into service.  Mark will be in contact with us as to his negotiations with the Creditor's Committee on reimbursing TW for all costs.  I think Sarabeth will be our contact on these discussions?

I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday.  Arnold Eisenstein will be available if any questions or concerns arise.  Thanks, Norm

Please see the attached file for the weekend notes of March 16th-17th.  We had problems with the confirmation phase of several cycles over the weekend.  Worked with Help Desk and Production Support to complete cycles.

Thanks, Bert

The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Perhaps we should look at applying the drag reducer sooner.  With Bisti out of service, the drag reducer may give us some additional capacity.

What do you think?

Ben:  Please check and see if the DR application w/o Bisti gives us enough additional capacity to warrant an earlier application.

FYI,
To stay out of conflict with some big EL Paso outages on the San Juan Lat. in May, we need to look at dates after May 21. Just a heads up.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy
