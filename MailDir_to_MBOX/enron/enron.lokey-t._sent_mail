Keri - I would like to add my nephew, of whom I have legal custody, to my membership at the Met - or Downtown Club.  His name is Michael Anthony Orona.  He is 17 years old, and will turn 18 next Wednesday, January 31.  (He was born 1/31/83.)  As I stated, I have legal custody of Anthony, I am raising him as if he were my son, and he is included in all of my Enron benefits.  I have papers from a court of law awarding me custody, with the full consent of both of his parents who are unable to care for him.  His address is the same as mine - 507 Welch, Houston, TX 77006.  He is a senior at Lamar High School and very active in school and extracurricular activities - including sports.

I hope the rules will permit Anthony's addition to my membership as I have been raising him as a son for several years.  Please call me at 713-853-6868 if you have any questions or require additional information. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you for all of the help and inspiration you have given us these many years.  I will miss you very much but am very happy for your new opportunity - it is well deserved.  (My now ex-wife) Sandy was very grateful for the help you gave her, and still asks about you when the subject of the Body Shop comes up.  

Where is your new fitness center?  We may have to come by and check it out.

God bless you each day.  Keep your positive attitude and you will be blessed.

The contract with ECS provides that if we exceed 21000 hp  we must pay additional amounts to ECS, thus negating the benefit of the fixed price quoted in the contract.  The incremental charges are applicable if we exceed the 21000 hp limit even once in a month.

Teb,

Would you please verify that the ECS agreement is structured in a way that would cause us to limit the output of CS 13. We can electronically control the station. We would like to develop the programming correct the first time.

Thanks..........Jim

Subject:	Re: CS13A Horsepower limit   

I agree with Frank's reply.  However, I would like to add some to it.

The units should be designed so that for minimum cost, we could in the future obtain FERC clearance and increase the HP output to 30,000 hp.  

Also, I understand that even though we will have FERC clearance and the equipment capability to operate the station at 24,000 hp, we should set up the controls to limit the HP to 21,000 hp.  This is because of the electric power contract with ECS.  We believe that although we will be handicapped by limiting the hp to 21,000, we can get by.  If we later find out that we can't, we will have to negotiate for additional power and change the controls to whatever hp is needed between 21,000 and 24,000.

Phase IV volumes will be FTS-2 rate schedule and will be company 536 (just like Phase III).  Phase V will also be company 536.

DO you guys have any specification for reporting purpose on phase IV? Larry and I need to know if a company number will be assigned to identify volume and revenue for this, we are trying to come up with a way to bill phase IV. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Hilda

As per the meeting held this afternoon, the following was discussed:
We determined that new business requirements must be identified to capture the GRI discount in the system automatically for invoicing.  It has not been determined if the enhancement must be in the contract or invoicing system.  Hilda Lindley, Larry Hill, Rachel Cady and I will meet to discuss the requirements and rules and will convey this to all involved ( I will get a conference room and send an email with info.).  

If you have any issues or concerns, please contact me at 35655 or Hilda at 35663.  thanks! nb

Heads up!  In talking to Rachel about GRI charges and how they are handled in the system,  we identified some problems in how the GRI charges will be handled for Phase IV and Phase V customers.  These customers will be discounted GRI and the discount will not be limited to the delivery points on the contract, the discount will apply to any point they deliver to in the market area. 

Currently, when GRI discounts are input into the system, they are at a point level - this will not work when the same delivery point is on firm contracts other than Phase IV and Phase V.  Also, when the discount is given at the contract level, we need to keep in mind that the customer may deliver in the west - how will this affect the billing?  

Lastly, we need to consider for development in the new system, the possibility of consolidating these Phase IV and Phase V contracts with the customer's current firm contracts - how will they be billed then?  Certainly, this cannot be captured in our current system, but may be captured in our new system.

Let's get together and discuss these issues and any others anyone may think of so we can get a plan together before implementation of Phase IV.
I have reserved room 4102 for Tuesday, December 5th at 1:30pm.  Hope to see you then.  nb
