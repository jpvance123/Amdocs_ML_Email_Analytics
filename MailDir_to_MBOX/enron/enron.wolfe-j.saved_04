BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a=
=20
new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for=20
delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the=20
over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron=01,s Internet-based=
=20
transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first=20
transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumbe=
r=20
buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed=
=20
price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in=
=20
the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product=20
provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure.=20
Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron=01,s=20
increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized=
=20
expertise in financial risk management.

In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the=
=20
Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest=
=20
Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled=
=20
newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mil=
l=20
now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North=
=20
America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers=20
Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local=20
community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of=
=20
the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred =
to=20
the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City.=

OK, so I don't know all of you and many others are long estranged.  And
there's nobody estranger than Brewster!  Hey-oohhh!  Yes!

Now that I have tickled your funny bone, I would like to tickle another
bone.  That bone is the one that is interested ushering our mutual friend,
Eric Ellwanger into blissful espousal.  We are throwing what the French
call "un party d' bachelor" for the bon bon homme.  (I do not speak French,
but I think that last bit rhymed.)

I really do not have a lot of information yet, I just wanted to make sure
that everyone keeps the date open.  The main event is Saturday,  May 12th
(a week before the actual wedding).  But, I think we oughta make a weekend,
and then a week of it, since at least Eric and Adam will be free for the
entire week between the bachelor party and the wedding.  It will take place
in Houston, but naturally will have global repercussions.  Out of towners
and drunkards, don't worry about a place to stay, I've got lots of room.

Oh, don't get too excited, but I might be able to get the KLF to perform.
They've got a hip new sound!

In the meantime, I would love to hear any ideas you might have for themes,
party favors, and the like.  Maybe something to do with the Cardinals,
Hawaiian shirts, or malted milk.   Also, if you have any pictures, please
send those along, as the hosts will possibly be developing a website to
chronicle this event.

Sincerely, Clay

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=

 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=

with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=

Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=

sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst 
/ Associate Program, which are effective immediately.

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Analyst / Associate Program

Hi Jay,
I thought I'd send you some lite reading.  May provide a distraction for you
from your normal day.  This is a first hand account I received from Capt
Greider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be
interested in, but at least it is the true story and account.  Suprisingly
not a whole lot different than the media reported.  The ROC vs PROC point
was interesting.  Shows the thought process of an insecure government.
Anyway enjoy.
Dad

AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION
April 12, 2001
By Captain Guy Greider
Continental Airlines
Since the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.  Navy EP-3
surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with
mild interest.  This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I
never dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched
international drama.
Somewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese
Governments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to
retrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call
was made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas.
Continental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch
this kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took
shape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes
in a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State
Department.
On Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph
Freeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told
me that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue
mission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without
hesitation.
Later we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case
the Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were
under the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the
negotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an
apology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental
crew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our
bags were packed and waiting by the door.
On Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to
say that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S.
crew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing
sheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight.
We would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air
Force specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and
communications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the
airplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.
The 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows
of seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know
the condition of the
24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They
were prepared.
When our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to
fly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight
time involved.
They were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried
5 very experienced Flight Attendants.
They were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and
Beverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo.
Our load planner was Mike Torres.
At about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no
earlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire
exchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We
estimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in
Haikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam)
Some of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s
invitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge
at the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest
with our much-anticipated mission so near.
By 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather,
flight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight.
Again, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at
precisely 2:15 AM.
The stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to
the airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation
database of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain
access to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is
not in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried
sophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government
officials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight.
The route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines
along the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly
toward Hong Kong.
This routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace,
something that the Chinese could consider offensive.
Approaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control.
After establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut
to expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable
distance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing
our airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The
instant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of
the plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan.
We told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our
airspeed.
We were still on schedule.
Now we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island.
Captain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast
with 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS
approach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many
other airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an
11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We
touched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to
illuminate the sky.
The local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was
beside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the
airport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut
down the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and
vehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were
brought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door.
The Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of
their communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were
also briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case
the Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard
was an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the
translator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to
have everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents.
He collected all of our passports and left the aircraft.
Before he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to
deplane.
Peter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and
servicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the
walk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a
chance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed
between people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft
and the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and
departure live.
Once the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around
for any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could
happen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who
was on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and
demanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General
said that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the
general declaration, which is standard on all international flights had
listed the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for
Republic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over
this.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the
Peoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them.
With the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete,
2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they
bolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last
one was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were
withdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed.
It was my turn at the controls.
Once airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the
bright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over
international waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from
the back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch
over the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He
wanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft
Commander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The
Ambassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and
the entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how
proud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving
the lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they
had been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job.
After his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the
cockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had
happened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8
Chinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot
made 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the
intercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on
the EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at
the time.
The fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane
rolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to
lose altitude.
The Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the
nose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone
departed the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on
the right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3
depressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating
airspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the
forward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and
wrapped around the tail.
We were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The
dive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000
feet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching
the aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was
certain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan
Island.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives.
They made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally
recognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow,
they managed to get the airplane on the ground.
Their next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic
surveillance equipment aboard the EP-3.
Meanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and
were yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days
would be a very uncertain time for them.
When we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated.
Their food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese
restaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some
coffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided.
The crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their
return home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner
from the United States.
The rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful.
During the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and
enjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing
at Anderson AFB was carried live on national television.
We taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out
to welcome all of us home.

Hi folks.  I'm not as witty as Clay, and I know even less French, so I'll
get straight to the point.  Bachelor party plans are well underway, but a)
we need an idea of how many people we're working with, and b) we need your
suggestions on the best way to celebrate Eric's last few days of being his
own man.  (Okay, those were back in 1996 or so, but it's a symbolism thing.)

To facilitate this, Kiernan has erected (hee hee) a website dedicated to the
May 12 party.  Go to www.burrosale.com, and click on the picture most
representative of the dates Eric went on before Tara.  If you choose
correctly, you will be able to read updates and post on a message board.
The message board is to be used to discuss the party and embarrass Eric in
any way you find appropriate.

If you haven't already please RSVP by e-mail to me, or call at 512.297.8085
or for a local call, Clay at 713.662.3789.  In order to defray costs, there
will be a "suggested donation" of $25.  Spots in the limo will be assigned
on a first-come first-serve basis to those that pay.  I hate to do that, but
the poor starving law student best man isn't eating only Wolf Chili and
Ramen noodles because he likes that pork flavor.

Anyhow, check the site frequently for updates, enjoy the board, and spread
the word to those I don't know that would be interested.

Don't worry. It sounds like Chastant is going, at least.
I would consider going, except I don't work in engineering, and I don't
like Chastant.

You can convince me if you are definitely going and I can show up around 7.

Dear Jason Wolfe,

This letter is to inform you of some NETeller updates:

Secure ID Added

As an added feature and to ensure your security, the design team at 
NETeller.com has instituted the NETeller Secure ID feature into its signup 
process.  The Secure ID will provide an additional layer of security to all 
NETeller.com members and will ensure that no one other than the authorized 
account holders can have access to their NETeller.com accounts.

How it works

All NETeller.com account holders will be emailed a 5 or 6 digit Secure ID.  
This Secure ID will be unique to each individual NETeller.com account holder.

Your new Secure ID is: 885892

The Secure ID will be changed and updated approximately every 4 months and 
this change will be emailed to all account holders at that time.

Upon successfully entering the users Account ID and Password, each user will 
be prompted for their Secure ID code.  By entering the Secure ID, users will 
gain access to their account page.  If you forget or lose your Secure ID code 
you may contact our customer service department at 888 258 5859 to retrieve 
it. 

NOTE REGARDING PASSWORDS

You will NEVER be asked to reveal your NETeller.com password by a 
NETeller.com representitive.
You should NEVER give your password out to any unauthorized user.
Passwords should be changed regularly and often.

Thank you

The NETeller.com Development Team

Subject: Gas Performance Testing TODAY - April 5, 2001
Importance: High

The Unify Migration Team would like to thank you for your participation in 
the gas performance test on Wednesday 4/4.  Based on our observations, system 
monitoring, and your feedback we have identified several areas for 
performance improvement.  We have attempted to fix some of these issues and 
need everyone's help again on Thursday 4/5 from Noon until 2:00, to test the 
modifications and identify other areas for improvement.

The purpose of this test is to continue to measure Unify's performance on the 
new platform and find new areas for potential improvement before the 
application is delivered into production.  Identifying performance issues at 
this early stage is extremely important to all of us and beneficial to the 
successful completion of our migration efforts.

Thursday 4/5 Testing Agenda (Same as Wednesday 4/4)

Retest Day 1 Items - Use April 3rd & 4th Gas Day in the Unify2K PT Gas 
database.  Your floor contacts and phone numbers will be the same as Day 1.
  
DO NOT PERFORM TESTS FOR DAY 2 - These activities will be addressed in the 
next round of performance testing beginning 4/18.

Attached are the documents that were distributed in Tuesday's meeting.



Thank you again for all of your help and support.

Jason-

Beth and I went to dinner and a movie, very traditional, on Friday.  It
was good fun...have not seen a chick flick in a long time.

Are you asking me if Matt can come out and play on Friday?  Yes, I think
so...if he does not have to be in McAllen for work.  He has been going there
a lot lately to check up on the drilling for work.  I will tell Matt that
you are trying to get a game together.

Kleenex box shoes...if you keep reminding me, I may actually make them, so
mind what you say.

How is work, are they still shamelessly profitting from you hard core
work ethic?

Later,
Tamara

  Jason,

   I am having trouble doing your expense report.  SAP is telling me to have 
a tech fix
   the problem but it is a big process and I am switching over to Windows 
2000 tomorrow
   so I hate to go through all of that when everything will be different 
tomorrow.  Do me a
   favor, go in to XMS and change my name to Alex Saldana.  That way she can 
do your
   report for me.  Try to do it today before we change systems.  Let me know 
when it is
   done.  Sorry for the inconvienience.

TEST.
http://personality.familywonder.com
According to us, he has a lot in common with SCAR from the Lion King.

Are you surprised?

And what about you?  Are you too introverted? Too outgoing? A thinker or a
feeler? A gossip?  What famous character do you resemble?

To find out, take FamilyWonder's Personality Test right now!

It reveals tons of stuff about yourself and how compatible you are with all
your friends and family.

Dear Jason Wolfe:

Thank you for choosing Ameritrade as your discount broker. We have received 
your account application and have opened your account.  Through your account 
application you requested margin approval.  In determining which customers 
will be extended margin privileges Ameritrade considers, among other 
criteria, the following information:

- Employment Information
- Financial History
- Minimum Equity Requirements

Our review of your application revealed that you did not meet the requisite 
criteria for opening a margin account with Ameritrade.  Based on the 
information provided on your account application we will be unable to extend 
credit to you through the use of a margin account.  Your account has been 
approved as a cash account and you may trade accordingly.

We want to assure you that the information used in making this determination 
is proprietary in nature and is for Ameritrade use only.  We have not 
reported the fact that you have been denied the privilege of trading on 
margin to any credit-reporting agency.

On behalf of Ameritrade, we thank you for believing in yourself and choosing 
us as your discount brokerage.  We look forward to providing you the best 
possible trading experience.

Sincerely,

New Accounts Department
Ameritrade, Inc.

Josh,
I guess you've been too busy to lace up your basketball shoes and get out
of the office.
It hasn't been too hot out, and I am ready to get back out on the court and
