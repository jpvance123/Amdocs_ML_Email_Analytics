Fyi: The PA and ETA have been with Jim Petrie of UBS legal for several days, but we still do not have UBS legal approval. I have been hassling Mark Taylor, who has in turn been hassling Jim.

As a result, I am anticipating we cannot begin marketing to our Top 50 customers on Monday. The Splash page will be ready with full functionality Monday night, so I am hoping we get approval on Monday for a Tuesday Top 50 marketing launch.

All,

Louise has asked me to coordinate across all departments on the Enron side for the integration with UBS and to be the point contact for the person who is leading the UBS side of the integration.

Accordingly, please send me your launch timetable and top issues lists.

Thanks,

Dave

Louise,

Kevin Presto has some concerns about doing transactions with brokers and is thinking maybe on the power side that we will not do any broker transactions either over the telephone or online and he would like to talk about his ideas with you and the gas guys as well.

I won't start marketing to brokers until I hear from you or we meet on the subject.

Do you want me to organise a meeting?

Fyi:  Copy of email I sent to Pat O'donnell.

Subject:	Product Name

Pat,

I remain concerned that we should proactively promote a short product name.

I realise this is not consistent with Group's position.

Some considerations:

- If we do not promote a short name, the market will do it for us. Noone is going to refer to the system as "The online trading platform for UBS Warburg Energy". They will find something 4 syllables or less.

- This is a system which had a very high profile and unique identity within the industry. Downtime is reported in the trade press. Numerous general news articles referenced it. Whether we want the "Product" to have a unique identity or not, it will have one, and we should control it to the extent we can.

- EnronOnline was more than just a means of doing business with Enron. It was recognised by many as a kind of "marketplace", which provided a unique combination of liquidity, pricing and ease of transaction. The market will look to our new system as the replacement for this marketplace and the marketplace needs a name.

- Some segments of the market are already starting to use their own short form during informal conversation. They have selected "UBSOL". As discussed, I think it is in our best interest to aggresively provide the market with a replacement for this. To do otherwise means we will shortly be stuck with this name and it will be very difficult to "unstick".

- There are significant volumes of online and offline documentation (Help, etc.) for which it is helpful to have a name by which to refer to the collection of people, processes, internal trading tools, reporting applications, administration applications, and website. It is important to note that the website, though the most visible part, is only one part of the overall "system" which was EnronOnline.

I understand how an extremely large corporation such as UBS would be concerned with the proliferation of product names, which could be confusing when looking at all of them on a single list. However, many of our customers will have exposure to only a few UBS products, and for the individuals at those companies, most will have exposure to only one: The trading system.

No redirect currently in place. Pat O'donnell was unsure whether or not Mike Hutchins would object to a redirect or not and was going to bring it up with him, but last time I spoke to Pat, he had not connected with Mike on the subject.

Subject:	Marketing Issues

Louise,

1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . .

2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name.

Dave

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

Dave

Louise, 

I am intending to start getting brokers signed up as soon as we know our new company name and have the PA and ETA forms authorised.

Do you think we need explicit buyer authorisation before we start signing up brokers?

Subject:	Online Launch Plan Update

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Louise,

Am working with the Marks to resolve our issues. I have a feeling this email of a few days ago may come up now or in the future, so here is a copy if you ever need it.

The email covers the use of www.ubswenergy.com and the "conditions" around it.

Hi Dave / Kal

Looks like we can use the ubswenergy.com domain name for a few months 
then integrate you guys into the ubswarburg policies over time.  Can 
you send back an email confirming that this works for you.  I think 
this is the best compromise we can reach for the moment which allows us 
to not waste any more time in discussions!

Stuart

Following our conversation this morning I just want to confirm what we 
have agreed. 

Pat - please can you read through the points below and send Stuart an 
e-mail confirming that you agree with everything, particularly the 
'Conditions' section, and that all the UBS Warburg Energy staff will 
comply with the conditions as laid out below.

Decisions:
=======
1) The brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from 
Enron will be UBS Warburg Energy. 

2) The domain name will be www.ubswenergy.com and we will also point, 
but not market, various other domain names to the site, eg 
www.ubsenergy.com, www.ubswarburgenergy.com

3) The new entity will follow all UBS Warburg corporate identity rules 
in terms of font, imagery and colour usage for all printed and online 
material.

Conditions:
========
1) That in 6 months' time (week beginning 29 July 2002) our position is 
reviewed. If this venture is successful and we plan to continue with 
it, the branding position will change and the entity will be fully 
incorporated into UBS Warburg and any changes necessary with regard to 
branding will be made.

2) The domain name will change, will follow corporate guidelines and 
will follow the format of www.ubswarburg.com/energy (where the 
'/energy' part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate 
name is used.

3) All printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand 
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have 
a relatively short shelf-life as it may have to be re-printed.

Louise,

In the Governance email which you sent, Mike Bridges was identified as a member of the Operational Restart Sub-Committee. I assume you meant Mark Bridges.

I suspect this might have lead to Mike receiving a phonecall today from UBS asking him for information.

An excited Mike called me to ask if he is invited to join UBS. I told him that I thought it was a mistake, but that I would confirm it with you.

Couple More:

1) I heard a rumour that we will not be sending confirms when we relaunch. Is this correct? (I hope not)

2) Have you thought more about the PA's without Buyer name issue?

Louise,

I have received a copy of a priority list which you had forwarded to credit.

This list is very similar to the Top 50 gas and Top 50 Power lists which we put together with Commercial - there are only a handful of companies different. 

Credit are asking for a prioritised list which has the specific legal names with whom we wish to trade.

The Top 50 lists already have the specific legal name. We will add the specific legal name for the handful of companies which were on your list and not on ours, and forward to credit.

Dave

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

Attached please find the proposed Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application for Netco.  I have included a clean copy of each document as well as a red-lined copy marked against the version sent to Mark Taylor by Dave and Carl. 
 
You will note that I have made a number of changes to the original EOL documents.  
 
1.  The Password Application.
 
The Password Application contains no substantive changes.  I advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the "purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities (including derivative products)".  The description is sufficiently broad to cover any potential expansion beyond the original gas and power products, as well as third party product offerings.  After a brief discussion regarding the auction platform with Louise, I revised the PA to reinsert references to the auction.
 
2.  The Electronic Trading Agreement.
 
There are numerous revisions and additions to the ETA.  I outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration:
 
a.  I added a sentence at the end of Section 1 to make clear that in the event the ETA conflicted with any other agreement between the parties, including any terms posted on the Website, the ETA controls.
 
b.  I added a new Section 2(h) to address Counterparty content posted on any public area of the Website.  To the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future, it may be a good idea to include such a provision.  If we do include this section, do we want to limit our license of the content to use on the Website and related materials, as proposed here?  If you do not want to include such a limitation, we can add the word "worldwide" to the first sentence before the word "royalty-free" and delete the balance of the final sentence after the phrase "not distorted by displaying only a part)".
 
c.  I revised Section 3(e) to clarify that Netco is not required to send written confirmations of on-line transactions and to provide that electronic records are admissible as evidence of the transaction.  The last sentence of the section is intended to make clear that to the extent the master agreement requires a written confirmation, such master agreement controls, provided that the failure to send a confirmation will not invalidate the transaction.
 
d.  I added a new Section 4 to address transactions posted by unaffiliated third parties.  (This issue was already covered in the last paragraph of the original PA.)
 
e.  I revised Section 5(a) to clarify that Netco is not liable for any direct damages and to expressly cap its damages to amounts paid by Counterparty for accessing the Website.
 
f.  I revised Section 5(b) and (c) in response to issues raised by many counterparties when I negotiated EOL ETA issues. 
 
g.  Section 6(a) has been revised to expressly provide that Confidential Information excludes counterparty identifying information, as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form.  Please let me know if you disagree with the scope of this exclusion.  If you don't want to exclude counterpary identifying information, we can merely delete the phrase "the identification of Counterpartt as a user of the Website and shall also exclude".  I added a 1-year term following expiration of the ETA to the confidentiality obligation in Section 6(d), reasoning that most of the confidential information protected by this Section belongs to the Counterparty, not Netco, and thus desiring some cut off point for our obligation to maintain confidentiality.
 
 
A number of our counterparties enter into transaction by and through service companies or agents.  I have prepared a revised Password Application, side letter to the ETA, and Consent and Acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well.
 
Please give me a call with any questions or comments.
 
Regards,
 
Leslie

Victory

We have a definitive statement from UBS that we can brand our product as UBSWenergy  (OK, so the "w" still sucks, but I'm looking on the bright side).


Setback

We still have not started marketing to our Top 50, due to a) Not having phone numbers for Connecticut until about 4:00 today and (b) Not having an approved cover letter from legal (It turns out everyone thought someone else was doing it - despite repeated calls chasing this up).


Plan

As of minutes ago, I have a Lou Eber approved cover letter, which Lou specified requires approval from Mark Taylor and Claudia Robinson. I assume I will have these approvals by morning and will start marketing then.

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		
Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Louise,

Carl and I have done a quick once-over on Leslie's GTC. I think the format she has chosen is doable, but I need clarification from her on some points.

It is possible that the market might accept an amended EEI more quickly than they would accept our simple GTC - I don't know.

It is interesting to note that the EEI amendments in Leslie's GTC are 5 pages long (excluding the elections sheets). Our original GTC was 8 pages long.

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

I have spoken to or heard from Mark Taylor, Bill Bradford, Mark Haedicke, Leslie Hansen this morning. Here is the update:

- Mark H. expects all documentation (templates only) to be complete and signed off this week. UBS legal is now apparantly also feeling the heat.
- Bryan Murtaugh will be on site tomorrow night. They will work on getting Bryan's approval on final contract forms for all documents (physical, financial, GTC, Master, Adoption) through Thursday and Friday.
- Bill will have credit clauses and headroom identified for Master and GTC for the Top 30 customers by end of this week, and for the entire list you gave him by beginning of next week.

- My interpretation of this is that we will be in a position to start assembling custom Master Agreement early next week.

I have stressed the importance of getting this finalised quickly, and pointed out that the commercial teams have been assigned to customers and are waiting only for legal documents.

Hello Louise,Dave,David,

Is there any reason why we should not get started with the process of 
getting business cards and Amex cards for all folks that have signed 
up to join the new entity?

Louise -- If you think appropriate, could you help escalate the my request below through a call or e-mail to someone in the legal team.  I am trying to finalize some FAQs so that we are ready to communicate our plans with people internally and externally after the judge ruling.  I've written answers to most, but there are some holes that only legal can fill in.  Thanks.

Louise,

We tried to find a way around the $250,000 portalbuilder charge for content which I emailed you about before. 

Looks like there isn't a way - and in fact, the total charge will be closer to $1,000,000, including all of the components needed for content.

So, the official question is: Do you want us to spend this much to preserve the ability to carry EnronOnline content, or do we revise the Quotes page to exclude content?

I am personally having a hard time finding value for money in this expense - but you mentioned before that UBS were keen to preserve existing functionality.

Dave

I imagine you may have already taken care of this, but just in case, here is the original email I sent you, with the ETA and PA from last night pasted in:





Louise,

As discussed, there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new Buyer as soon as possible, in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of EnronOnline (NETCoOnline) without delay.

Two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA), which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on NetcoOnline.

Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.


Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.


Password Application:  

 
Electronic Trading Agreement:

Following is the text of an email announcing the simulation, which I intend to send out first thing in the morning to all UBS Warburg Energy employees (i.e. Houston-based UBS employees), as per John Lavorato's request. If you have any comments, please email me by 8:00 am CST.

Thanks,

Dave



We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Kal came up with a couple of suggestions:

	"TraderKey"
	"QuotesKey"

	- Consistent with other UBS products (like Swisskey)
	- Few syllables
	- Doesn't use the UBS name, so shouldn't be as sensitive to the name police
	- Is generic enough to survive UBS name changes or other companies posting products on the site in the future.
	- Are available as a URL

I especially like "Traderkey", which has positive connotations and provides potential for some interesting marketing campaigns.

Louise,

- UBS do not want us to show "UBSWenergy.com" - they require "www.ubswenergy.com" (no caps) or "ubswenergy.com" (no "www").
- This means that for the homepage to look right, we will change the name to "UBS Warburg Energy" beside the globe graphic.
- Currently anticipate starting Top 50 marketing for PA's by tomorrow morning (UBS required changes on Splash page).
- Some traders in the market have started to refer to us as UB SOL. Although the low-profile approach we discussed made sense, on further reflection, I think we need to aggressively promote a positive short name for the system, to avoid the "SOL" connotation. Even "UBS Energy" is a lot of syllables. We are working on finding some alternative (perhaps which don't use "UBS" in the name, as that seems to be a sensitive point). If we are to do this, we will need to lobby at a level higher than where I have been so far. If you agree with my concern, some higher level contact might be in order; perhaps with some of the people you have been meeting?
- Will work with legal today on Master Agreements and GTC's, to try to get template approval AND to draft Masters for the Top 50, with specific credit terms.

Dave

I'm thinking 3 and 4 are not as nice as 5 and 6, but that this would be OK, and preferable to moving to the North Tower and that we should be trying for a longer lease, with breaks we can exercise at our option. We should be in a good negotiating position.

Thought?

Subject: Real estate issues re: UBSW Energy, LLC in Houston


Hello Pat, Louise, Dave

The UBSW real estate department is reviewing the current/future lease 
terms for UBSW Energy LLC, in Houston.  According to Brian Dugan, our 
lead real estate guy on the bank side, the building owner has offered 
a nine month lease to stay in the South Tower on the 5th and 6th 
floors.  After the nine months we will be offered the option to sign 
up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3 
and 4.  Is this a significant issue?  I understand that the 3rd and 
4th floor foot prints are similar to 5/6.  

If UBSW Energy is willing to relocate to the North Tower, they can 
get a lease for 5-9 years but this tower may be less suitable.  What 
are the issues here?  

The integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with 
the Bank's outside legal firm we use for real estate issues.  We have 
a target date of this Friday to try to resolve all real estate issues 
in order to meet the DAY 0 legal integration date of 2/6/02.

Your thoughts please.

Mark

Louise,

As you know, we were told during today's Integration Committee call that Marketing's and Legal's text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today. Following the call, however, I was told that the noon deadline was firm, but
we could make minor text changes on Thursday. Based on that information, we forwarded partial comments to Kal Shah by
noon. In a late afternoon email, I found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live.

We appreciate the pressure and long hours people in Houston are putting into getting the site up and running. We applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden. I tell you this only to make you aware of our situation, should
any problems arise because of the unedited text. Hopefully, if anything does arise, problems can be easily and quickly
corrected.

Please call me at 212-713-8508 if you have any questions or if I can help you in any way.

Thank you,

Claudia Robinson

Louise,

I was doing a last pass through these documents, when I noticed that the last sentence of the 2nd to last paragraph contains something similar to what you had removed from the ETA: "UBS may give Counterparty's name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty". This wording was changed in the PA in Sept. so was not redlined in the changes you and I reviewed earlier.

I'm OK with this staying in. Please let me know if you want it removed.

Dave

Please review the attached PA and ETA. These are the final versions of the documents that we plan on using. The PA might go out to the top 50 customer as early as this afternoon. We are preparing the UBSWenergy 'splash page' and will upload this version of the ETA unless otherwise advised.
The entity is officially named UBS AG, London branch (collectively "UBS") and the Website is UBSWenergy.com. If you are not in agreement with this, please advise ASAP.
I encourage everyone to read both of these documents very carefully. I have looked them over several times and everything looks to be in order but your 'fresh' review is appreciated.
Thanks.

Re: the HSR waiting period issue:

We can proceed with our plans, but all correspondence will be handled through the UBS call center in Connecticut. 

I plan to start doing this tommorrow morning, assuming we get the Connecticut fax and phone numbers tonight.

Detailed changes:

	- Fax number will be in Connecticut, and will roll to here.
	- Connecticut call center person will answer any Help Desk calls, which will then be transferred here.
	- Connecticut call center will send PA faxes in accordance with instructions from here.
	- Cover letter will have UBS letterhead, but will be unsigned and will specify Connecticut numbers
	- Splash page will be modified to show Connecticut numbers
	- Once we reach Closing Date, the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here.
	- All future correspondence (and the bulk mailings) will specify the Houston number

The concern is that during the waiting period, we need for UBS people to represent UBS interests on all official correspondence with customers.

Please call me if you have any concerns. I plan to put out the revised Splash page and start the Top 50 marketing efforts at about 10:00 am tomorrow morning.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Greg W. wants us to use new phone numbers for the Help Desk, etc.

Unless I hear otherwise from you tomorrow, I will proceed with preparing our documents with the new Help Desk number.

Dave

P.S. I realise I have been emailing you a lot. Please let me know if you would like me to cut down - I'm never sure whether I'm overcommunicating or not.

Mark -

At Louise's request we have added some "disclaimer" text at the bottom of the splash page that will be released when we are ready to start re-signing customers. The intent is to assure customers that their registration forms, etc. will not be used should the deal btwn. UBS and Enron not go through.

Please review the disclaimer (below, or you can view the entire splash page via this link - https://hyperion.eoltest.com:8143/new_jsp/marketing/temp_register/index.html) and send your comments to Kal or me.

In the event that the above-mentioned transaction between UBS Warburg and Enron is not closed, all Customer Registration Forms, Password Applications and Electronic Trading Agreements received by UBSWenergy will be considered null and void and will not be transferred to any subsequent entity.

Thanks,
Erica Bess Duncan

There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions:

?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

The Master User ID is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant.

Louise,

1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . .

2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name.

Dave

1) Do you know if NetCo is going to have similar arrangements in Canada to what we had before bankruptcy? (e.g. trader in Houston trades Eastern Canada on behalf of ENA, but trader in Calgary trades Western Canada on behalf of ECC)

2) Looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve Reuters content. I'm assuming this is no big deal, as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel.

Louise,

1) Has there been any resolution on whether we focus on marketing UBSenergy vs. UBSWenergy?

2) Is our launch date confirmed for Jan 29? (did you find out the actual date of filing for Hart-Scott?)

3) I am chasing the final, punctuation-correct name for the contracting party for GTC, ETA and PA purposes, but as yet do not have a definitive answer. 

4) I am also chasing Articles of Incorporation so we can proceed with the Verisign application.

Louise,

There seems to be some confusion over this, but I would like to proceed as follows. Please let me know if you disagree:

1) For all contracts, "UBS AG, London branch" will be used (online/offline, license applications, regulatory approvals, etc.)
2) For all marketing purposes, UBS Warburg Energy, LLC will be used (letterhead, brochures, etc.)
3) When using UBS Warburg Energy, LLC, we will include small print along the lines of:"UBS Warburg Energy LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG, London branch" (I am confirming the wording and concept with legal).

Thanks,

Dave

Looks like they are pushing back on the "w".

We are just about ready to start changing site name references. Please confirm whether you want us to proceed with the originally discussed UBSenergy or if we should in fact change references to UBSWenergy.

Hi Dave / Kal

Looks like we can use the ubswenergy.com domain name for a few months 
then integrate you guys into the ubswarburg policies over time.  Can 
you send back an email confirming that this works for you.  I think 
this is the best compromise we can reach for the moment which allows us 
to not waste any more time in discussions!

Stuart

Following our conversation this morning I just want to confirm what we 
have agreed. 

Pat - please can you read through the points below and send Stuart an 
e-mail confirming that you agree with everything, particularly the 
'Conditions' section, and that all the UBS Warburg Energy staff will 
comply with the conditions as laid out below.

Decisions:
=======
1) The brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from 
Enron will be UBS Warburg Energy. 

2) The domain name will be www.ubswenergy.com and we will also point, 
but not market, various other domain names to the site, eg 
www.ubsenergy.com, www.ubswarburgenergy.com

3) The new entity will follow all UBS Warburg corporate identity rules 
in terms of font, imagery and colour usage for all printed and online 
material.

Conditions:
========
1) That in 6 months' time (week beginning 29 July 2002) our position is 
reviewed. If this venture is successful and we plan to continue with 
it, the branding position will change and the entity will be fully 
incorporated into UBS Warburg and any changes necessary with regard to 
branding will be made.

2) The domain name will change, will follow corporate guidelines and 
will follow the format of www.ubswarburg.com/energy (where the 
'/energy' part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate 
name is used.

3) All printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand 
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have 
a relatively short shelf-life as it may have to be re-printed.

Louise,

Some further clarification on the HSR waiting period:

- We will receive a letter indicating when the waiting period will expire. The actual expiry is anticipated to be midnight on Thursday, Feb. 7th.
- It is possible that objections or problems could be raised during the waiting period. This we will not really know that we are cleared until sometime on Friday, Feb. 8th.

Accordingly, I will plan on a tentative launch for Monday, February 11. 

I am still waiting for UBS legal approval of the PA and ETA. Once this is received, we will be ready to start our PA marketing efforts to the Top 50 customers. I intend to do this as soon as the documents are approved. If you need me to check with you before we start contacting customers, please let me know.

Dave

Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.

Louise,

In the event that some of the people who are being offered positions in UBS do not take them, but instead resign, and we therefore keep someone in UBS who otherwise would have gone to the estate, I thought we should agree potential bonuses.

To be clear: these bonuses would be paid ONLY if the individual wound up going to UBS instead of the Estate as currently planned.

If you agree, please let me know and forward to Amy Fitzpatrick. This should allow us to respond quickly as events develop.

Louise,

Attached is the list of Top 50 counterparties. 

As mentioned in my prior emails, and mentioned by credit in our meeting this morning:

Credit have a list (the one you previously supplied), but have been frustrated in that the list shows only group names and does not show the specific legal entities within the group name whom we need to approve (e.g. Aquila Risk Management Corp vs. Aquilla Capital and Trade). 

Attached is a list which we put together which was taken from the Top 50 Power and Top 50 Gas customer lists, based on online transactions.

Further work needs to be done to add back the actual power ranking and prioritise based on total value of business between both gas and power, and to prioritise the sub-entities, but this should give you an idea of what we hope to have ready to send to credit tomorrow.

I'm trying to reconcile how giving them this list helps at this late stage, but they have requested it, so I intend to provide it tomorrow, unless you have any objections.

I have met with John L and most trading heads and back office heads.

Concensus was to have the simulation next Thursday morning (9-11).

We are in the process of assembling documents for the simulation. You don't need to read them, but if you are interested, they will follow in the next email.

- Agree on EOL group responsible to point of clicking. EOL Marketing will be responsible for contacting customers and getting signed PA's returned, but we plan on getting phone call assistance from Origination/Trading, where they already have a relationship with the individual at the customer company.

- The ETA which you sent had the section removed which would have allowed us to distribute customer names. (Clause 6a used to read "Confidential Information shall exclude the identification of Counterparty as a user of the Website")

Sorry only just got to read this.

I sort of see EOL group as getting the customers to the point of being able to click and our marketers doing the masters.

Looks like we will not get approval anyway - see you Monday morning.

What did we send - it in or out??

Louise,

Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:

1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.

2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:
	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.
	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.

3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?

Thanks,

Dave

Louise,

Although our actual content contracts are under conrol, it looks like we may need to spend $250,000 for infrastructure (Portalbuilder license).

I will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives. 

Do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content?

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Louise,

- UBS is planning to tell all of those who are offered positions to come to work at the Houstonion on Friday, not at the Enron building. At the Houstonian, they will have a series of presentations on the new company. I raised concerns about this last night:
- Having the UBS offerees offsite means that everyone left in the building is effectively told they are not a first-round pick.
- Those who remain in the building will have little to do but sit and feed off each other's discontent.
- Some of the initial offerees may refuse, in which case we then have to go back to a discontent Estate person to offer them a position. This makes it very obvious to them and all their peers that they were a second-round draft choice.

I have suggested that they either accelerate the contracting process so we know that we have everyone before Friday, or else delay the Friday meeting. The Friday meeting was stated as necessary so that everyone could understand their benefits before signing. This doesn't sound like a good reason to me.

- I am told I will be approached today by someone from UBS HR. I assume this is what you warned me about and that my "real" contract/meeting will be with you.

- UBS wants me to sign before they offer positions to others within EnronOnline. This doesn't make sense, but if true, can we meet as soon as possible? I'd like to make sure my people have their offers ASAP (for the above reasons), but I'd also like a little time to think about the offer you have in mind for me.

- I remain concerned that the people who were previously offered retention bonuses will be in a position to walk away at the end of Feb. We are in a position where the critical people will be free to go, while the less critical people are incentivised to stay for 6 months.

Louise,

We are happy to do this.

Shall we shift marketing efforts to support UBS Warburg Energy LLC, where appropriate? (e.g. letterhead, logo, etc.)

I sent revisions to the FAQ's and the cover letter to Kal Shah and
Leslie Hansen last night.  Kal assures me that all of the changes I
suggested (including the deletion of any mention of ubswenergy other
than as part of a web address) were being made.  Accordingly, I think
the message is getting through.  Also, in conversations with Mark
Taylor, I stressed that no trademark registration was to be made,
pointing out that the use of the url was intended to be temporary.
Mark had not had anything to do with a possible registration of the
mark, other than receiving a phone mail message.

We will see how things go, however, I believe the message has gotten
through for now.

The broader issue perhaps is that they appear to be naming/branding
the
on-line trading system UBSWenergy and using that as a marketing name
for their business.  For example, I had heard they wanted to
trademark
the term.  Even if they have approval to use the website name
temporarily, does it make sense to go out with a marketing name that
might be killed in 6 months - and for which we may not have approval
to
trademark?  Maybe not a popular position if Costas is behind this -
but
we should be sure everyone is clear on the possible ramifications.

Just so you know, there are some intellectual property considerations
behind this.  In order to best protect the UBS and UBS Warburg names,
group does not like us to weaken them by using UBSW.

this is the response that we have just received from group marketing.
all relaunch efforts have now had to be put on hold as switzerland
control the naming of the DNS servers.  pls could John or Mike put in
an urgent call to Heidi Baumann to square this one away.

fyi - the individual in UBSW Comms & Marketing who originally signed
off this request (Stuart Hepburn) has since left the bank.

Hi Isabelle,

On behalf of group marketing (Heidi Baumann) I have to reject this
request:

- www.ubswenergy.com must not be visible (but may be used as a hidden
technical
url).
- e.g. "www.ubw-w.com/energy" would be OK or old-style:
"www.ubsw.com/energy.

Hi Judit, hi Robert

We set the DNS servers temporarily on what the customer ordered as it

be very time critical. It should be seen on the internet by tomorrow
at

Nevertheless this activation needs to be signed-off. Please do so
asap.

Subject: ubswenergy.com: Changing authoritative servers



It is crucial that the DNS servers for ubswenergy.com be set as
follows (as soon as possible):

 dns0-ext.ubswenergy.com        192.216.57.100
 dns1-ext.ubswenergy.com        192.216.57.101

It is entirely possible that the names dns0-ext.ubswenergy.com
and dns1-ext.ubswenergy.com will be rejected because the
IP addresses associated with those names are already associated with
dns0-ext.enrononline.com and dns1-ext.enrononline.com.  If this is
the case, it will be necessary to use the enrononline.com domain
names
for the DNS servers and then change the server names later, once
ubswenergy is on-line and ready.  As long as the servers provide
information about both domains, this should be possible.

Dave,

I left you a voice mail about this.  I like version 2 and it will be the one which is the most likely to go with the activex control and require the least number of site changes.  I don't have a problem with the UBS colors in general.  I do not believe we have enough time to make their colors work correctly.  In the next version, we can do it right.

Let me know what you think on this.

Attached please find copy of the 6 designs that we came up with.

         
-  UBSengergy2 will be the best one that flows well with the rest of the site.
-  UBSengery5, and UBSenergy8 will complement well with the orange navigation on the trading page.

Heather has asked us to come up with 6 and 7 with red navigation.  This color absolutely will not go with the active-x.  As we discussed yesterday, we will not being able to make any changes on the active-x.

Please call me if you have any questions.  We will need your decision by the end of the day today.

Here is the list with the final names, showing 8 people moving to Estate, 1 resignation and 30 left with NetcoOnline.

They can be sent from Houston, but I think you will need UBS AG, 
Stamford Branch stationary.  Have you gotten a supply for this purpose?

We are in the process of preparing Master Agreements to go to customers.

Can these draft contracts be sent directly from here?

Obviously, each pack is quite large - it would be nice to avoid having 
to ship them to Connecticut just to have them forwarded from there.

Louise,

I think I may have made an error in selecting Heather over Erica for UBS. It has become apparant that, though she has kept a lower profile, Erica has made a larger contribution to the system and has a broader skillset than Heather's.

Accordingly, I would like to exchange these two for receiving an offer letter. If I am able to do this on the UBS side, do you object?

Please advise as soon as you can.

Thanks,

Dave

This is the list which was sent out on Saturday, updated to show full legal name in all cases along with the old Enron CPID.

Since Saturday, I have also removed a couple of the names which did relatively little business and could be processed as 2nd priority customers.

Louise -- Here are the designs that Mike G. is using to finalize developement of the web site this week.  They maintain the color scheme you requested and have been modified slightly to meet with UBS branding requirements.  The secure area screen will not have the MyContent section since we are not launching with Portal Builder.  I hope this meets with your approval.

Subject: Re-cap of branding decisions



All

In order to be clear about all the discussions that have taken place
on
the brand issues I've been asked to summarise the final decisions:

1. Website: the url is www.ubswenergy.com

2. E-mail address: firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com

3. Company marketing name: UBS Warburg Energy

4. Company legal entity name: UBS Warburg Energy LLC

The first three are to be reviewed after approximately 6 months.

Notes:

1. When referring to the new company in text, the website should
always
be referred to as 'UBSWenergy.com' and not just UBSWenergy - case can
be either upper or lower

2. The corporate identity rules of UBS Warburg are to be followed
when
producing any company material either for internal or external use.

The above was agreed with Heidi Baumann, Pat O'Donnell and John
Costas.

Rgds

Penny

Louise,

About 1 month ago, the process was initiated to disconnect the direct connections.

Experience showed that we were spending money on something which provided little benefit to the customer.

There is a chance that this process was not completed for every company (I am checking).

I intend to ensure that the direct connections are all converted to regular internet connections.

If you want the direct connections maintained, please let me know.

Dave

Louise -- FYI.  I received the following e-mail from UBS.  I think their IT group is putting together some recommendations for the domain name.  It seems UBS has registered 1)ubswenergy.com 2) ubswarburgenergyonline.com 3)ubswarburgenergy.com and 4) ubswenergyonline.com.  I know you registered UBSENERGY.COM.  I like that over the ones UBS registered.  As we get closer, I'll assume I'll find out which domain name is approved for the launch.  

Thanks

Hey Penny

Need your help urgently to pull together a short one or two pager for 
us to present to the business first thing tomorrow.  The one urgent 
issue that has not yet been resolved in regards to migration of enron 
systems is the domain name and how we direct traffic to the site.  Jim 
has registered the domain names below, in the absence of any direction 
from the business.  

To give a bit of context, the site will contain power & gas trading and 
third party feeds.  It will not have any intermingled content with the 
rest of client portal.  It will have its own electronic client 
contracts and disclaimers.  It will have a distinct team responsible 
for allocating client passwords, assigning entitlements, ehelp, etc.  
So in summary the whole site will be run and managed completely 
separately from rest of corp & institutional content.

I have copied Kal Shah on this email, who is the business person 
responsible for rebranding EOL.

So I guess the paper needs to cover the following:

1.	Branding decision (need to provide a high level summary of 
corporate center guidelines to tell the business what they should and 
shouldn't do in terms of domain names etc).  Need to refer to the names 
already registered below, but indicate that we can register any name we 
like.

2.	Options for client access to NetCo web site (ubswarburg.com or 
ubswarburg.com\domain_name or client portal\domain_name or 
ubswarburg.com\clientportal\domain_name or whatever

3.	Similar options we need to consider for internal access by 
traders

4.	What else????


any chance i can have a first draft by 2pm UK on Tuesday????

Thx honey
Ursula

Louise,

As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP:

1) PA and ETA approval
2) Agreement on new company name ("Netco" replacement) and new online system name ("NetcoOnline" replacement)
3) Approval of Press Release

I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase.

Thanks,

Dave

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

I had planned to call Per Dyrvik this morning (at Lou Eber's suggestion). Can I proceed? (Don't want to get in the middle of something you are working).

Dave, as per previous discussions, I am very concerned with Canada not using UBS AG as the contracting party. Additionally, Lou Eber has confirmed with me a number of times that UBS AG does not guarantee subsiduaries but rather UBS is " good for it". This will not work.

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

Anne,

I received your voice mail. We are working with each vendor to assign the contracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that content is available on relaunch of the system.

Affected contracts are:

Intelligence Press - no agreement required.
Accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Dow Jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Reuters - working on new month-to-month contract with them.

We will work with Leslie on getting written consents.

Thanks,

Dave

Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

Just a quick heads-up:

UBS is intending to give everyone in Houston an email address in the format: firstname.lastname.ubswenergy.com.

Obviously, this conflicts a bit in that we are promoting the online system as ubswenergy.com.

I don't see this as a huge issue, but wanted you to know before it happens.

Louise,

Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:

1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.

2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:
	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.
	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.

3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?

Thanks,

Dave

Dave/Bob -

I've attached a marked up version of your FAQ's.  I suggest we use this as a starting point for initial customer contact as soon as the buyer is known.  One of the power marketers will make the initial contact, but I suggest that you have one of the EOL marketers in on the conversation.

The attachment is meant as talking points for the marketer to use during the initial conversation.  I understand that you are scheduling a meeting tomorrow to discuss the EOL timeline/process.  I suggest we try to come up with answers to each these questions during that meeting.

Mitch
