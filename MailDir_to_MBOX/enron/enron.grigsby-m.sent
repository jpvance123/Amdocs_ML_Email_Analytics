Anne,

Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?  
I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association 
with Socal curves.  Let me know.

Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would 
be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.

Mike

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
Network Neighborhood?

Thanks,
Mike

I received a notice to provide feedback on Jose Marquez.  My review is brief, 
but very favorable.  The west desk is very pleased with Jose's contribution.  
He has gone out of his way to assist each of us.    Jose communicates the 
weather and its impact very clearly.  Let me know if you need additional

The Rockies index language looks good.  We need to separate the southern 
border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.  All 
Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and 
southern border - socal wacogs, while the PG&E topock/southern border - PG&E 
trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.  Please make the change to 
the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.

Thanks,
Mike

Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more 
positive income to the transport.  The position at topock is short.  I am not 
sure if this is the problem from Friday.  Let's get together in the morning.  
Thanks for the email.

Thank you for the summary.  Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas 
cost mechanism?  Are we confident that it is an average of all border points 
into CA?  If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, 
then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?  This 
avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, 
since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby

I am sure that you are aware of the move to daily basis from monthly.  The 
west desk will be trying to phase out monthly for daily in the next month.  
We have created term gd basis vs. the HHub gd through apr-oct 01 for all 
index points.

Thank you for the email.  It sounds like everything is going well for you.  
We are in Portland this week hanging out with the boys.  Planning to go

The Gas Daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the 
monthly basis desk.  We are making markets on GD basis for every term and 
index point.  This creates a nice market for term gd index.  Let us know how 
you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us.  The real opportunity for 
gd basis is at socal, where the monthly index is so unreliable.

We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in 
sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to 
book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to 
index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale 
to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the 
cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside 
Ferc?


Thanks, 

Mike

We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.

buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.  Also, run a report of all my term

outage work, or if there will be an effect on our outage bonus. He said
we'll be of line for several weeks. I'd say at least that since our turbine

Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet 
and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if 
they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They 
claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be 
penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.

Thanks,
mike

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Mike

Anne,

After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the 
LIQBasis tab in NCD.  The positions will include basis, physindex and gd 
index positions.  We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my 
risk will be to index postings.  This will be a huge benefit.

Gracias,
Mike

Okay, I think the tds tab in newcurrentday was wrong.  It is showing a jan 
pos of 269.55 lots, but TDS is showing 539.1.  False alarm.  We will fix 
newcurrentday.

The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.  

Thanks,
Mike

I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with 
restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West 
physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two 
months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am 
managing all physical positions.

Thanks for the update.  Try to stay flat on all gas dailies tomorrow.  Our 
length is good for now.  Let's stay flat for now in the oct index. I will be 
working from home in the morning.  Please have Matt email the ops reports to 
my lotus.  Also, please have Patti email her sheets also - the pipeline 
summary and flow reports.

Download the hearme.com software and login on my pc to use the mic, or the

Subject: Cash books, etc.

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.  


Mike

Greg,

I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of 
mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with 
Enron.  If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to 
possibly set up a meeting.

I work on the west gas trading desk.  You can reach me at x37031.  Thank you

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,

The position sheet from yesterday afternoon, close of business, is quite 
different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 11/29.  What do you 
think the difference is?  The SJ, Perm, and Socal don't match.  Are we 
booking them correctly.  Let me know.  

Ask Anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab.

Thanks,
Mike

Anne,

We need to delete the two trades listed under rockies that are priced 13.90 
and 14.00.  Please move these trades to Sumas and resend the data to the 
publications with an explanation.  The index for rox should be 5.9125 after 
you make the changes.

Thanks,
Mike

Jay and Matt,

We should get together and build a gas consumption model for the new 
generation in the west.  We should identify the delivery point and then 
continue to monitor their status.  This will provide us with more information 
behind our Socal/Rockies spread. 

Thanks,

Grigsby

Hutch,
 
How is everything at home?  We would like to come by this week to see the 
three of you.  I am sorry we couldn't come by last weekend, but we were all 
sick.  Jake continues to be a walking virus.  Talk to you later this week.

Thanks.  I don't think that there should be a fin gd swap position of 12 lots 
in the mojave index column.  Please check to see how the deal was booked.

Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another 
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in 
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and 
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in 
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a 
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets 
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas Trading

Dear Tom,

I am glad you like the website.  When you go into the personalize myquotes 
filter, select the commodity, region, and products.  You will need to scroll 
down the products list and select the US GAS phys index points of interest to 
you.  Please call me if you have any problems.  Your filter can then be 
sorted by right clicking on the filter at the column heading.  You can sort 
by five different groupings.  

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

I think the Proxim solution is the way to go.  Compaq has partnered with
these guys.

You need: an ISA card for your desktop and a PC card for your notebook


Here is the link that gives an overview of the product:

http://www.proxim.com/symphony/learn/costben.shtml


Here is the best deal I found where they were in stock.  I believe you need
the last two items listed on the page.

Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in 
sitara?  I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San 
Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in 
April).  The Baja transport is through March 2002.  80000/d to Citygate and 
20,000 to KRS off-system.

This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.  
Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,


Chase Belew

Steve,

Let's discuss all of your new rox products for EOL.  I would like to know 
which products to roll out on EOL for April bidweek.  I would also like to 
discuss creating a south of Muddy Creek product for Kern gas.  I would assume 
that it would fall under the IF Kern index.

Text of Gov. Gray Davis' energy speech
The Associated Press


   , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised
speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:
   "Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most
difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.
   "Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too
high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But
no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And
that's what I'm doing.
   "The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also
cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall
and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we
consume.
   "Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant
was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed
12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this
without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.
   "Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power
plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal
regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.
   "This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the
roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.
   "In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California
stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong. That's not all:
   -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower
prices.
   -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts
the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.
   -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.
   -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of
power plants.
   -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.
   -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.
If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs,
we'll build them ourselves.
   -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us
off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal
conduct.
   "We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real
progress.
   "Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates.
It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our
economy strong.
   "But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive
rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan
that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and
motivate the biggest users to cut back.
   "Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the
rest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,
rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see their
rates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've all been
paying since last winter.
   "But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.
   "Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more you
conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon
against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll help
secure our energy future.
   "Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to
financial stability -- if they agree to three main conditions:
   "They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.
Agree to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuits
seeking to double your electricity rates.
   "My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,
stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.
   "Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through the
summer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.
   "Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, and
reduce consumption in office buildings, schools and government facilities.
   "Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We are
34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimize
disruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We've
withstood earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.
   "Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'll
get through this as well.
   "Thank you and good night."

Hey guys.  Let's try this.  Take the data from 2000 and change the 
following.  Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the 
new gen numbers posted below.  You will need to add this demand to the EOC S 
ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).  We should use the 
2000 waha west volumes for now.  You should end up with reduced ehrenberg 
volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New 
Gen demand.  Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.  We will 
then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.  Also, add 
columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.  We 
should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased 
NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.  Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers 
and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  I would like to 
avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to 
reduce gas demand.  Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.  We may 
have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW 
electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.  We 
will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes 
between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.  
Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.  Let me know where my errors in approach may be.

This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 2001.





Thanks,
Mike

Barry,

I would like to focus our deal flow on Apr-Oct or 1 yr San Juan and Rockies 
supply.  Our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 2001.  Let's 
get together with Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, and others to set our supply goals 
for the mainly the apr-oct period.  I would like to work on buying every 
mmbtu of Opal, and all points included in the IF NW Rockies index.  Our goal 
should be to purchase at least 400,000/d of rockies supply and 500,000/d of 
San Juan Blanco and Bondad.  we have been buying these phys index points at 
+.01 in the rockies and +.005 in the San Juan.  You may need to coordinate 
with Fred Lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts.

Thanks,
Mike

Please create the following monthly for daily swap.  IF GD/D CIG (N SYS).  
The GD index is listed under CIG (N. Sys) on page two.  The monthly index  is 
listed as CIG Rocky Mountain.

Craig,

Did you ever follow up with Kim Ward and the desk on the contract language 
for the deal or deals you did with CA endusers?  We need to make certian that 
the customers are signed to the correct contract for balancing, etc.  Please 
get with me to discuss.

Are your reports still available for EOL that you created months ago?  I 
would like to turn them over to the fundies group ( Matt Smith) tomorrow.

I told you Friday that I would make 2.5 million.  The actuals came in right 
around 1 million due to a correction to the Sumas GD curves and an 
overestimate of $450,000.  Sorry about the mistake.

Mark,  

Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport 
this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this 
point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, 
then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.

A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be 
nice. 

Thanks,

Mike

We need to run regression on this load profile for Palo Alto.  We should back 
out the industrial class and run their residential load.  Can you find 
reliable weather for Palo Alto?  Kim Ward is signing a full requirements deal 
with Palo on PG&E.

Thanks,
Mike

Anne,

We will need to add a message to the email that we send out to the 
publications this bidweek.  Let's get together to discuss the text.  We have 
added new products that will need to be matched with their respective Index 
postings.

Thanks,

Anne, can we add the new pg&e topock curve to the basis transport tab?  Also, 
the LT transport section is showing the transport positions through 2002, 
which is incorrect.  Please review the transport deals in the model and 
delete the positions.

Thanks,
Mike

Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will 
need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to 
ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we 
have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job 
and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited 
staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline 
allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost 
impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the 
basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with 
an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential 
penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to 
the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be 
requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our 
counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take 
place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our 
counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price 
implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in 
regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.  I 
would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be 
above the "pipeline average".

Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our 
control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations 
that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to 
ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know 
which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at 
Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational 
information sooner.

Sincerely,

Mike

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.

I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this 
weekend.  Call Dale or Melba to activate.  Keith and I briefly discussed how 
we would handle the new responsibility.  I am fine with managing the prompt 
month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.  I will be back in the office 
this week and we can talk about the products.  Would we handle the monthly 
the same way?  When do we plan to phase the monthly out?  Have Phillip manage 
the perm and waha basis until I return.  

Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.  We can 
roll these out for all terms as well.

See you this week.

We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow 
constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock 
delivery points are 50%.  I would like my P&L to show this risk.  Please find 
a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set 
in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.  

Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.  Our 
transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave 
instead of Socal topock.  I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as 
SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.  The 
risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 
2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave 
topock.

Sincerely,
Mike

Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to 
work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on 
pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the 
desk to use.

Please set up the product as Gas Daily Basis GD/D HHUB - SCAL.  We will use 
this until we decide to create a subgroup of daily basis products.  Thank you

Ina,

Passport will probably need to be set up on Mike's desktop by an IT person. 
Most of the time they have to copy the application from my desktop
to make it work. For Gasselect, I will check with Mike and see if it is 
working. I believe all he needs is the login ID and password to make that 
work.
If you need anything else, let me know.

My address is 6201 Meadow Lake 77057 and my home phone is 713-780-1022.  The 
horns looked great last week.  Chris Simms is alive.  The best quarterback 
performance I have ever seen in Memorial stadium since Peter the Great.  Just 
think if we had Phil Brown running the ball.

We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E 
topock.  Please create your new basis and gas daily products for these 
indices as soon as possible.   Mattt will need to create the gd index 
products as well.  Let the brokers know about the new indices  I have the 
back office setting up new curves to book these deals.  You will have two 
curves for Socal now.  The curves will show your risk on the old index, as 
well as the new index.  The new Socal index is the same as the old except 
that excludes KRS.  

I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.

Matt,  

Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and 
by pipe in CA.  Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be 
shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.  Let's discuss 
the impact on sendouts.

Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen 
outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days 
gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from 
the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on 
Thursday.

Tom,

See the email below for the ID and password.

Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any 
questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need 
to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).  
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of 
setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our 
posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted 
average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.

Thanks,

Mike

Anne,

I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD.  
Please have all of the positions in the BasisTransport tab, section transport 
model, added to the phys index position totals.  Please look at the PG&E CG 
positions for May-Oct, I added the transport positions already.  I would like 
to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d 
transport that we have.  Also, please have the new transport index positions 
at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the 
physindex tab.  We can review in the afternoon.

You are doing a great job.  I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank 
you recently.  The market is distracting me.

Sincerely,
Mike

Sorry.  The topock curve should be marked as Socal flat.  Remember that we 
show the differentials in index spreads.  Please make certain that the pg&e 
topock curves are flat to socal in the future.  Can we run a report showing 
the curveshift spread between the two points since Jan 1, 2001?  Thanks.

That was the main factor.  The cash market also had a difficult time trading 
higher than 14.50.  The basis curve was on its way to contango, when it has 
lived in backwardation for some time.  This created resistance on the basis 
curve.  The PG&E announcement pushed it over the edge.  Market is back up 
today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement.

Start buying N-M citygate index this week.  Pay as much as necessary to get

Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up 
correctly for market prices.  Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to 
Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc.  The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next 
month, does the transport work at these spreads?  

Please make the changes before prebid.

Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month.  Please 
prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.  

Thanks,
Mike

Hello JJ.  The Clark family will have me traveling to Abilene on this day.  I 
hate to miss the highlight of the X-MAS holiday.  Let me know what the plans 
are for New Year's Eve this year.  Will you guys be in Houston?  I hope 
Dallas is treating you well.  We can't wait to see Michael.  Clark and Jake 
are doing great.

Hello.  The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers 
regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.  
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid 
physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and 
greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now 
accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.  This will allow us to 
trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.

Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?  
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.  We would 
like it to be very upbeat and funny.  

Thank you for your assistance.  I can be reached at x37031.


Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas trading

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

Dear John,

I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it 
seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my 
mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked 
properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners 
and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the 
options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as 
schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift 
as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index 
curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  

The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him 
concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and 
financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one 
within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than 
I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen 
at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go 
to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  

I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it 
is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and 
discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It 
may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until 
this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I 
will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my 
added responsibilities.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

maint on washington ranch will have a bullish effecst on the basins.  I will

After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think 
we have decided on a plan.  Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term 
basis.  This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, 
ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products 
are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the 
index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.    

With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no 
secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and 
the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for 
the baseload phys.

Thanks,

Mike

Let's continue to go long sep swing on Socal.  I am willing to as long as we 
can each day.  The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies 
because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.

I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.  Please 
refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these 
indices.  We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we 
currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the 
database.  I would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following 
points.  El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal 
Gas, large packages.  We will need to add electronic to the product title to 
differentiate between the two gd swaps.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

Please review the transport positions in sitara for next month.  We should 
have the Baja transport included.  100,000 short for PG&E topock, 80,000 long 
Citygate, and 20,000 long KRS.  The sj to socal transport should be broken 
out to like 24,000 topock, 14,000 mojave, and the balance to pg&e topock.  
Also, please check on the kingsgate to malin and stanfield to malin for next 
month.  What about sj to waha?

Patti, please run a report showing all of the sitara transport deals.  Thank 
you!

Please read the following email from EOL.  I have asked them to assist the 
West desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers (utilities, producers, 
industrials, and some IPPs) notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum 
volume accepted on all of our EOL products.  Start thinking of which 
customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present 
this to our customers.  EOL has asked us to provide them with the text of our 
message.

Also, let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products (primarily all 
phys and gas dailies) this week.  We are attempting to capture all of the odd 
lot flow in the market.  I would see this service as a clear advantage over 
the other web platforms.  

Let's get together on Friday afternoon at Ninfa's to discuss our ideas.

Thanks,
Mike

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.  

Thanks,
Mike

looks much smaller than it did today.  Please check to see if Patti made

Thanks. It looks like the phys transport volumes were added to socal and 
citygate, but could you add all of the transport model positions to the 
physindex tab.  PG&E topock, san juan, mojave, krs, etc.

I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.  We should have 
Anne fill this spot. I would like her to keep track of New Current day and 
all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your 
group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.  She can also 
put physical deals in Sitara.  Let me know what the desktop PC will need to 
be loaded with.  Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to 
accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You 
can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.

Thanks,
Mike

There is another problem on the invoice.  According to the PG&E
transportation billing Newark Sierra Paperboard used 72758 mmbtu and
California Paperboard used 14650 mmbtu.  The total mmbtu invoiced should
be 87408 mmbtu not 87800 mmbtu.  Please bill California Paperboard 14650

into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that 
to work and then VPN into Enron.  That also did not work.  I spoke to SWB 
tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was 
unsuccessful in those as well.  I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.

I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me 
to believe that there was something wrong with the line.  SWB said they were 
going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.  
At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team 
that is more familiar with these setups than I am.  I do think it would be a 
good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange 
a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.  

Regards,
KG

Dear Tom, 

Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to 
discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.  I think the market 
requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with 
respect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a 
divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The 
marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has 
proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting 
daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas 
during these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the 
Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places 
downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock 
gas.  Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to 
the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's 
interconnects.  Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   

There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of 
liquidity.  Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport 
contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. 
The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.  The overwhelming 
demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.  Although Ehrenberg is the 
marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream 
capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at 
Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf 
of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg 
simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One 
transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller 
buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This 
illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. 

Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha 
basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because 
of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on 
EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These 
molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, 
all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery 
interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on 
the SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas 
going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on 
the EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does 
the EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the 
EOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG 
Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south 
mainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available 
historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg 
demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may 
have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone 
West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the 
max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available 
capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate 
transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the 
maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not 
know.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are 
above historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for 
the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There 
simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn't 
enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the 
market in all cases.

I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern 
California border.  The market would  be better served with supply being 
included in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG 
Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market 
will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in 
the future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an 
index for the Socal citygate as well. 

Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.

Sincerely,   

Mike Grigsby
Director of West Trading

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use

I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas 
fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower 
hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.  We need 
to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that 
may increase gas consumption in 2001.  

Let's discuss in the afternoon. 3:30 meeting.

Please make certain that all physical positions are loaded correctly in NCD 
for term.  Have Patti Sullivan load all transport from the transport model in 
sitara so that the physical index positions will be recognized in NCD.   This 
would include SJ/Perm to Socal through OCT, Baja through MAR 20001 (100,000/d 
short PG&E Topock, 20,000/d long KRS, and 80,0000/d long Citygate), Kingsgate 
to Malin(Barry), Steve South's latest transport deal from Kingsgate/Stanfield 
to Malin, and any SJ to Waha transport.  

Anne, did you get a ticket from Steve on the transport mentioned above?  
King/Stan to Malin.

Also, let me know what the status of the transport deal from Kingsagte to 
Malin with Barry.  

Is the gd index for Perm position loading correctly in NCD for Apr-Oct?

Mo, please carry out the physical positions in NCD through Mar 2001. 

Thanks!

simply designated associates on the trading floor?  No big deal - just

Ina, I can't seem to find the expense deposit for the SW Bell charges in my 
account.  Will you please contact them again and ask them for a copy of the 
check?  Thank you so much.

Frank,

The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get 
the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am 
pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis 
market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal 
through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the 
future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the 
same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know 
in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.

Thanks,
Mike

Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to 
discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the 
market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, 
storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and 
that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think 
we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?  
Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, 
etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?

Let's discuss in detail.

Mike

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Thank you for contacting me.  The new baby is doing great.  I would like to 
add you guys to the box if you are interested.  I would also like to have 
your west physical guys on my box.  It has been brought to my attention that 
APB has great fixed price physical flow.  If you are not aware, I am running 
the physical desk as well.  Let everyone know that it will based on one 
condition - All numbers or no numbers.  We do not wish to participate in a 
closed market. 

Call me later.

The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.  
How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?  Anne, we will need to come up 
with  a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the 
publications.  Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the 
future.  It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported 
accurately each day.

Please make a few minor changes to the Scal product.  I would like it read 
GD/D SCal - HHUB.  I apologize about the mistake, but SCAL is a premium to 
HHUB.  We also need to take a look at the description, fixed and floating.

Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this 
product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus 
nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled 
out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going 
forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, 
as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be 
out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.  

We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to 
market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be 
considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to 
participate until their numbers are audited.

Thanks,

You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.  I have been 
asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out 
on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner 
that you manage your cash products each day.  We have been asked to have one 
a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market 
depth.  You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade 
mid functions.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding 
this request.

Thanks,
Mike

Your replies are brief and extremely vague.  I will assume that you are not 
interested.

Is this a real product?  Do we need Larry May to price these spread options?

Are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in 
my newcurrentday position sheet?  I know that Phillips triggered their 
volumes back to GDA equivalent and that Matt Lenhart bought some GDA malin 
gas.  How do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk?

Dear Jeff,

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and 
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for 
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few 
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for 
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month 
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an 
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can 
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact 
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west 
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get 
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Dale,  

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood 
on-system spread -   GD/D Malin vs. PG&E Citygate.

Call me to discuss.  Thank you.

Mike Grigsby

I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.  Please run a new P&L 
early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will 
be.  I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves 
before we decide to book these tomorrow.   Please run a report from the 
transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.

Thanks,
Mike

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  Thank you for the invite the other 
day.  I just had my second child, so I am little busy.  We will be turning on 
the box with natsource gas daily today.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  
The information reported internally warranted suspending business with 
Natsource for a few days.  I am not interested in hearing your side of the 
story.  Business as usual here forward.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby

Will you please set up the 100% flow SJ product?  I would like the title to 
be just like the current EP product -  no mention of 100% flow on the title.  
I would like to avoid making this a separate index posting.  Let's make this 
available to the entire market.

This is the data that we will use to build our Socal growth estimates.   Take 
a look at the file and then we can discuss how to combine this with current

As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.
