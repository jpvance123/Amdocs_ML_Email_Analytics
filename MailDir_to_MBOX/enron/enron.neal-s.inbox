Charles & Scott,

I wanted to circle back with both you with respect to employment
opportunities at Enron.  I am in the process of narrowing potential
opportunities.  As such, is there currently an opportunity to move forward
with Enron?  If so, please feel free to contact me.  In any event, I
appreciate your consideration.

 Subject: confidentiality agreement






Kelley,

I am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding
disclosure of counterparty names for price verification purposes.
Can you give me the name and contact information for the person within
your company that would work with us to put a Confidentiality Agreement
in place.
Jeff Hodge is our lawyer who will work on this for Enron.  Jeff can
contacted at 713 853-6911 or by email at jeffrey.t.hodge@enron.com.

Thanks for you assistance.

Scott Neal

Scott ---

I put this together to sort of summarize our activity to date on New England points.  As you can see, the volumes are moving up pretty steadily and we're at least getting a presence up there - with no assets, virtually no transport.  At the same time, we've taken pretty minimal risk.  Also of note, we are getting alot more calls for multiple month pricing on these points as well.

Please see attached spreadsheet....

 

Scott

I want to pass on some work information for you to share with the members of your team please.
     
Enron has partnered with Ford to provide special discounts to Enron employees on top of the rebates and discounts that normally apply.    The plan is called the Ford X Plan.   

Here's how it works: 

To get this discount you need this partner Code XB981 or either call 877-975-2600 or go to https://www.fordpartner.com/index.asp and enter the required information. 

Name
Address
Company
SSN
Etc. 

Upon providing this information you will be given or sent a PIN number.  Then you can go to any Ford dealership, tell them your an XPlan member, give them the PIN and tell them what car you want - no negotiating no haggling.  Any rebates and discounted interest rates still apply to this price. 

Regards
Frank

Due to some problems with my email yesterday, I may not have received your RSVP.....please excuse any confusion this may have caused.


RSVP REQUESTED!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy Meeting" on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

WHEN:  Friday, May 18
TIME:   10:00 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided

Tanya,

This is a follow-up to my two calls this morning.  I have talked to Pat Ebert at Ashland.  I asked her why they refuse to pay their October 2001 invoices.  She said that her management wants to speak to someone in upper management at Enron.  I asked to speak to her manager and was told that she was in a meeting.  I asked her to get her out of the meeting.  She did not comply.  Her managers name is Sherry Tackett.  Her phone number is 614-790-6941.  I left her a messsage.  I told her that I expect payment for the ENA upstream, for 559,000+, and for ENA for 374,000+.  I also told her she received to commodity so the payment is due.  I told her  expect it today.  I left my phone number and told her to call me as soon as possible.


Thanks,
Tom McFatridge

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal (2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  Sorry for the trouble.

Hey Patro,

You are still my idol. Ever since I first saw you disco dancing in front of
the
car headlights I knew you were mentor material.
Hey, is anyone going to homecoming?

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

Scott,
Nice chating with you yesterday. I am in Chicago today.

It's going to be interesting if we can grow the Ag. Group for Enron on the
Grain/Oilseed side. Think I can bring good value for them from the start,
they want to go global too,

Fyi, the guys that I met where Ted Noble, Darren Maloney and also Elsa

Saludos,

Pablo

PS: Thanks for leting Elsa now my references.

Due to the sale of HPL we will be modifying  the General Terms and Conditions ("GTC") governing all North American physical natural gas transactions on EnronOnline, on Nov 5th. This will require all Counterparties' not having a Master Agreement governing Physicals to accept the revised GTC in order to continue transacting in these Physicals.
In order to ensure minimal disruption to trading we are taking the following steps.
There will be a pop-up announcement to this effect on EnronOnline on Monday Oct 29th 
There will be a ticker with the same information all week , next week on EnronOnline.
The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.
The EnronOnline marketing group will be contacting customers who had previously accepted the GTC to make sure they are comfortable with the changes. 
If you need more information or have any questions please call me at X 31787

Scott,

As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.

Just to give you some facts:
We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper. 

We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it.
Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.

Credit: Trey Skelton @ 918-573-5662 and Tim Neuman @ 918-573-4880
Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278

Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.
If you have any questions, please call me x54099.
Many thanks for your help !
Best Regards
Ellen

Hey Patro, thanks for coming over and talking to me at the Astros game the other day. Were you afraid I would see you with your girlfriend.  Whatever....you're still a short fuck with no wrap. 
Middletones....Is that what you were playing all those years?  I thought that you were making crude noises with your stomach.  Are you still in Temple? 
Yeah this is Trammell.....living in Houston, have two little girls and Lisa's still married to me.  I'm getting my ass kicked by them daily. 
Let's get these e-mails rolling....

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

                       COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                  MAY 29, 2001

Notice ID: 2435
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED

REMINDER - The notice posted below is still in effect.

                 COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY
                  NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                        JANUARY 19, 2001


SUBJECT:  NOTICE TO PARTIES DELIVERING OR CAUSING GAS TO BE DELIVERED TO
   COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY

Pursuant to Section 25.2(a) of Columbia's tariff, Columbia is providing notice
of the imposition of the following additional gas quality specification on all
shippers, interconnecting pipelines, producers, and receipt meter operators,
and all other parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into Columbia's
system:

     All gas tendered under Columbia's tariff shall have a gross heating value
    of no more than 1050 Btu per cubic foot.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days
after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.


In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all
parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated
Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on
the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence
to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant
to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating
value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be
required upon Columbia's request.

Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set
forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas
processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in
Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding
redeliveries.

Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any
party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from
its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set
forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of
the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering
Columbia's system.

Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing
this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its
reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may
occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas
quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional
gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being
received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's
pipeline system and its operations.

You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and
seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu
gas.

Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761,
or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.

I think that a mid year promotion with a year end bonus will get her comfortable with the system and then she will sign an employment agreement going into next year.

I definately support  a promotion.  I have not given up on the contract, although I have not figured out how to make it more palatable for her while ensuring 
she is committed to Enron.

Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.

Scott,
I overheard you talking about NY City studies earlier.  The two files attached were work in progress that I although not completed and a little rough I thought may be useful in their current form.  I am working with Sabina Rank to take over and complete all of my projects and daily fundamentals duties.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Sean
 
 
If you have problems with the links when opening this file, I also put a copy in O//_Dropbox

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors.

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.   The deadline to register is Monday, May 21.

EPA has announced that it will move forward in publishing a proposed rule to guide states in setting "best available retrofit technology" (BART) requirements to comply with new Regional Haze standards.  The proposal was approved on Jan. 12 by then-EPA Administrator Carol Browner, but current Administrator Whitman was reviewing that decision to see if EPA should change course.   It is now clear that EPA intends to move forward.   The compliance deadline will be around 2008, but companies will be making decisions in the shorter-term about installing technologies or other compliance strategies.

The BART requirements will primarily affect coal utilities as well as industrial boilers, refiners and steel plants built between 1962 and 1977.   While the rule will apply nationwide to facilities affecting national park areas, the main target of the rule were sources in Western U.S. states affecting visibility in the Grand Canyon.

In addition to technology requirements, an emissions trading program could become part of the compliance regime for the Western states, but only if the BART requirements are not providing the targeted reductions.

The AP story below provides a good summary of the rule.  Or if you're really adventurous, you can access the original 148-page proposed rule at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/fr_notices/bartrule.pdf

Please call if you have any questions regarding the regulations or the impact on Enron businesses or customers.

Note -- I have included you on Environmental Strategies' current distribution list for "Regional Haze".  If you would like to be removed, or if others in your area should be added, please let me know.

EPA Adopts Rule to Cut Haze in Parks
By JOHN HEILPRIN, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration will not challenge a proposal
approved in the last days of the Clinton presidency to clean up hazy skies
over national parks and wilderness areas, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman said Tuesday.

The proposed rule, requiring states to impose pollution controls on
hundreds of older power plants, was approved by President Clinton eight
days before he left office. It would require coal-fired utilities,
industrial boilers, refineries and iron and steel plants built between 1962
and 1977 to be retrofitted with new pollution-control technology by 2013.

However, some could meet the requirements by swapping pollution credits,
which companies can earn and trade by reducing their overall emissions.

``Part of the President's commitment to protecting national parks includes
protecting the views that draw us to these parks year after year,'' Whitman
said. ``We intend to clear that air. This rule will help ensure that people
will be able to see and appreciate these national treasures for many years
to come.''

That would cut sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter and
directly improve the air in 156 national parks and wilderness areas, the
EPA said. Haze is caused when light hits tiny particles, such as soot,
sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxide emitted by power plants, refineries or
natural pollution sources, such as forest fires.

Whitman said the visibility in some national parks, like the Great Smoky
Mountains, is reduced by as much as 80 percent on the haziest days.

Environmentalists said Tuesday they worried the administration still might
try to delay or weaken the Clinton-era proposal before a final rule is
issued. The proposed rule already was studied by several federal agencies
under former President Clinton.

``The concern is that the White House or the Office of Management and
Budget or the utility industry would push for a weakening of the more
aggressive approach reflected in the Clinton proposal,'' said John Walke,
director of clean air programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Meanwhile, a group of utility companies has been fighting in federal court
for the past two years to block the EPA's regional haze program.

The proposed rule, amending part of EPA's 1999 regional haze rule, tells
states which of the older industrial facilities that emit more than 250
tons of view-impairing pollutants annually must install ``best available
retrofit technology.''

But it also gives states flexibility to consider economic factors, energy
impacts and the remaining useful life of the facility. The new requirements
also could be met through an emissions trading plan similar to one used in
EPA's acid rain program, giving states that take this option more time
beyond 2013 to comply.

States that affect the air quality of the Grand Canyon - Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming -
also would get different time frames to work with, the EPA said.

In Western states, the pollution cuts a 140-mile view down to 33 to 90
miles on average, the EPA said. In the East, 90-mile views often are
reduced to 14 to 24 miles on average.

Scott-
Don Miller would like for me to get together with you to discuss several gas storage transactions that have been originated recently (in MI, LA and TX).   I have been meeting with Jean Mrha and Laura Luce and their respective teams, but want to better understand a trading perspective on these assets.   I'm more interested in your macro views than specifics related to each particular project. 

Please let me know a time that works for you (tomorrow or Friday would work best for my schedule).
thanks,
Jeff

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement "prior to April 1" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more "Transco-like" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified "why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days," said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that "Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue." But the commission went on to say that it "may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that "it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded."

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to "remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system," FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas "has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided."

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices "may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637."

The order went on to say that "a less draconian measure" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism "that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price" if it wanted to provide "an incentive for shippers to remain in balance," FERC said.

I need ten minutes of your time to review the discussion database concept that was requested by Frank Vickers back in Febuary.  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the merits of the project, make a decision on whether we move forward and if we do move forward whose budget this would impact..  Find attached a description of the project with a cost estimate ($10,560).
I have scheduled EB3259 at 5:00PM 4/24/01, if you cannot make it please let me know.
Thanks,
Sean

Our move date is set for Friday, 11/9/01.  At this time they will be moving the gas trading group to the 6th floor and the gas operations group to the 5th floor.  They will follow with the power groups on the following Friday, 11/16/01.

Assistants: Please be ready to submit a churn on this Friday 10/5/01 for your individual groups (I will let you know if this changes and once I am certain of the seat numbers for your groups, I will give them to you). I will also need to give you your mail stop locations at the new building, which I am working on now with the mailroom.  In the meantime, from now till we move, please start cleaning up your areas and your groups areas and discarding anything that isn't needed.  It has been requested that only 6 boxes per person be moved because space is limited.  So we need to decide what can be sent to archives.  I will send you some forms for this. Please come to me with any questions.

Deskheads:  Unless, there is any changes from the office of the chair, I will set up a meeting with each one of you on Thursday to make sure you have no changes to your seating.  Once the churn is submitted there can not be any changes other than new additions to the group or deletions from the group.  This is to prevent there being any mixups when installing equipment at the new building.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under "The Office of the
Chairman".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money to
be reserved at the "Chairman" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement payments
were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the bad news.
After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no reserve at the
"Office of the Chairman"  for these additional funds.  Now, the good news.  Georgeanne 
will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that we can
quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.

If you have questions, please give me a call.

Hi Scott,

I just wanted to let you know that have been in Houston for a while since the office in Bogota closed down at the end of last year. I am currently working in the DSM Desk in EES and I would definitely like to speak to you whenever you have some time. Please let me know when would be a good time for you.

Best regards,

Pedro Fernando

Scott:
 
As discussed, here's the particulars on the Bee County  Ranch:
 
795+ ac, lots of oak trees, one of the higher hills in Bee  County.  Good mix of pasture and sage brush.  There's a water well and  tank.  
 
A real "honey hole".  Lots of quail and prime dove  hunting. Deer, hogs and supposedly some turkey.
 
Owner's name is Colton Brinkoeter.  Asking $675/acre, no  minerals.  Negotiable.  I think for that price you ought to get 1/4 -  1/2 of the minerals.
 
Ranch is three miles west of Mineral (NNW of Beeville about 15  miles).  His number is 361-358-2582.  I found out about it from a  mutual friend of ours, Bryan Key, also from Beeville.
 
P.S.  I've also attached my resume.  It looks like  our pipe deal fell through, and I am looking hard for a job back in  international marketing.  Let me know if you hear of anything.

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Recently, EnronOnline has changed direction in regards to 3rd party access to EnronOnline and our technology.  We want to make sure that we are working closely with each of your desks to ensure that both of our interests are aligned.  Please be informed of two initiatives that we are working on.

Creating private label e-market places for other companies 
	- We are utilizing the technology that we've created for EnronOnline to create similar platforms for other companies (real time trading to inventory management).
3rd Party price posting on EnronOnline
	-Essentially, we are selling licenses that allows 3rd parties to post their products onto EnronOnline.  We are targeting products that complement the current product 	set listed on EnronOnline (i.e. pipeline capacity).

Please pass this along to members of your group.  Any discussions involving our core commodities would require prior desk approval.  We are available to speak with any of your groups in more detail.  If you would like to discuss these initiatives, feel free to contact myself at 713-853-9673 or Brad Richter at 713-853-4893.

Thank You,

Dan Diamond

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

To all,

I spoke with Jan Aspuru (OUC) this morning.  He indicated the max volume they would take summer would be 60,000 mmbtu/day ten year term.  He went on to say that a winter drop to 50,000 mmbtu/day would help put our proposal in line with what they are currently looking at.  We should assume winter to be November - March.  

Items to consider:

Scott - Is their a price drop to entice them into 60,000 baseload to gain access to the winter economics on the 10,000 drop.  i.e.  Do we offer Hub plus .53 for sixty baseload?  Something to consider and your call.  When LNG comes up, notice I said when, we can sculpt.

FM - standard natural gas industry language?  If LNG becomes cover, doesn't allow for any shipping delays, etc.
LD strategy - do we put caps on penalties or an out clause if nondelivery occurs for a certain number of days, presumably a number of months consecutively.

Timeline - We need to get a proposal to them by mid-month.  It appears a short negotiation period to close ends can be had after the previously mentioned July 1 deadline.  Short means about a month.

During our initial discussion, OUC suggested preferred pricing would be Gas Daily Zn 2 plus $.55.  We suggested with our risk management abilities we would consider any pricing they preferred and further suggested Index with the right to convert to Gas Daily or others.  Does the desk have a preference? - Gas Daily exposure seems better for us - but conversion could still be had even under a Gas Daily contract - need your thoughts.  In this regard, I have set a meeting with credit, Phil I'd like you to attend, at 9am tomorrow to begin the process.

Give these items some thought and I will schedule a meeting for Wednesday, June 6th at 4pm in 3259 to discuss.

Phil and I will continue to work toward that meeting.

Thanks for your assistance as we move forward to this agreement.

Regards,

Jared

Hey Scott
Realize the timing is terrible for a sit-down conversation.  But, I'm sitting on the 6th floor now in the new bldg now: 6193- and am guessing you're not far.  If you're around today and have time, let me know and I'll stop by to say hello.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.

Hey Bob, 
We've already discussed the hurricane ranking issue at our last staff meeting.
I discussed rankings with Scott and we're ranking per the attached schedule with exceptions/interzone same priorities being handled on a pipe by pipe basis between the scheduler and the trader.  We also have a spreadsheet saved on the O drive to track supply/market cuts if any occur and Sabra/Clarissa will update depending if they are NE or SE cuts.

The file is O:\Common\Logistics\Gas\2001hurricane.xls.  It also includes a weekend contact checklist on the first page that will be updated if there is cut potential during a weekend. 


  
Let me know if you require additional information

THANKS
Victor

As discussed in our staff meeting, please make sure we are ready for the hurricane season by having your schedulers review and maintain rankings with their respective pipelines. Make sure this is discussed with the appropriate traders so there are no surprises when/if we experience supply shut-ins. In addition, you probably want to have a spreadsheet structured for the desk in the O drive where your team can access and update information on supply cuts. I will have the inclement weather plan updated. Also I believe we are in good shape with the laptops for remote access if we have local problems. 

Let me know if there are other things we need to be doing. I would also like an email from each of you letting me know that you have done your homework and are ready.

Tks - Bob

only beach football game.

Winners will dine on:

Crab Stuffed Jalape?os
Barbacued Shish Kabobs in a spicy mustard sauce
Mixed vegetables, salad and garlic bread

Loosers will cook.

Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of "modules" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

Tom

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

On a serious note, I got a call from Larry this past week and he told me that Lee Christie's mom past away last Sunday. She was only 61.  I've been playing phone tag with Lee to see how he's doing.  
I don't think he has e-mail either or you could send him a note. Lee doesn't believe in the new technology.   
If any of you on this list have other Phi's e-mail addresses send them to me and I'll compile a master list.  We can trash talk all we want.

Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that she does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.

John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.  I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the "East Desk" does not have to accelerate the payment of its "debt" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction. That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.  The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement. If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.  I need to understand our position this week if possible.

said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who mi=
ssed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this seas=
on, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers w=
ill likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a v=
ery risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - F=

Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati E=
nquirer . "If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to ge=

en , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken ha=
nd, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Bro=
okins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job=

lay in a deeper league.  M! o! e Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/=
27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason =
Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running bac=
k, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post =
great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL =
- Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a frac=
ture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four =
weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens'=
 starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deepe=
r league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did n=
ot practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York News=
day reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K=
 BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. B=
uffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND -=
 JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to r=
epair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  M=
ora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a =
team physician. "I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well=
," Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee wh=
en he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He wa=
s placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to=
 take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts =
offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James =
will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Mat=
ty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't rec=
over from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, a=
nd perhaps the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coac=
h Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster =
spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day go=
es by, it gets a little bit closer."      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday,=
 a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after agains=
t the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks befo=
re the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to=
 action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to b=
oth Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you=
 play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim =
, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle =
injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catc=
hes for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/0=
1 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapol=
is. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't reall=
y sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is lis=
ted as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him =
on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffe=
red a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankl=
e. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boo=
t as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but=
 he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. =
  Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a =
hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice o=
n Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve =
tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR G=
B - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three str=
aight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His stat=
us for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy=
 team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Da=
vis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find =
out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his he=
alth, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cu=
t him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewar=
t, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, i=
s expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting goo=
d Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of dept=
h at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batc=
h , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Pres=
s , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groi=
n injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He pra=
cticed a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) trea=
ted...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose =
snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky prop=
osition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris miss=
ed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran t=
ight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Upda! =
te! d 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 i=
s still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who i=
s dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the wee=
k.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will =
likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful=
 that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Wei=
nke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 i=
nterceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "Ther=
e've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gon=
e through times like this," coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observe=
r. "Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out a=
nd there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be=
 more beneficial than not." While he may be the starting quarterback in Car=
olina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sa=
nders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's gam=
e against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for =
the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he=
'll be available for the game. "I'll be there," Sanders told the Arizona Re=
public. "They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - n=
ormal wear and tear." In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a =
good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Marti=
n Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light runni=
ng last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a =
lot of progress," coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. "We're goi=
ng to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision." Moore,=
 who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the inj=
ured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commiss=

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Mark

David,

I was reviewing the 7 page summary of the longer term muni bonds that I
recently bought.
This summary is very helpful.  I would appreciate it if you could also
provide me with the following:
1)a summary of the short term municpal bonds I bought about a month ago and
2) a combined summary of all the municipal bonds I recently purchased.

Please call me should you have any questions at 713 853 4723 or 713 503
3466.


Thank you,


Scott Neal

In delaying implementation until COB Wednesday, I was trying to get past AGA's announcements.  I've been told that they may not be able to liquidate immediately after AGA's are released.  (If market collapses, then buying shorts would be easy, however if market rallies, the impression is that they may want to sell into the rally.)

The short version is that they like their positions.

Immediate desk head feedback has been to delay these factors, perhaps implementing over the weekend.

Importance:	High

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.

Scott - Attached are my notes of the OUC deal that Jared thought you would like.  

Dan - We need to incorporate the terms and conditions that I have mentioned in the summary below into a confirmation sheet.  I'm assuming we have a Master Firm Agreement with Orlando Utilities, but if we don't, we need to get a contract drafted as well.  I will check in with you to discuss.

Thanks.

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project


The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

	I submitted the Parking Provision outline to Bay Gas last week after our meeting.
	
	I need to circle back to determine where we are relative to getting pricing pulled together
	for the gas portion.  I've been in need to put a hard offer in front of this customer for several
	weeks now.  They are in the process of making a critical decision & I would like to have
	something in hand that values the Parking optionality.  

	Thanks
	mk

	Team,
	I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this 
	concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their decision any day now 
	and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our 
	dependence on the minimum load factor.  

	I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
	I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum.  
	I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today.  

	I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving ASAP.  

	Thanks,
	mk

Western Electricity Prices Rise With Weekend Risk, Hot
Weather

     Los Angeles, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
for Sunday-Monday delivery in the Western U.S. increased
today amid weekend risk premiums and warmer weather
forecasts in the Southwest, traders said.
     In its seven-day outlook, Belton, Missouri-based
Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would
average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the
Southwestern U.S.
     The Bloomberg index price for Mid-Columbia day-ahead
heavy load power increased $17.00 to $55.00 a megawatt-hour
amid trades at $50.00-$60.00. The off-peak index gained
$19.67, with trades completed at $40.00-$43.00.
     "There was a buying interest today which caused prices
to have gains for the day,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California,
the Bloomberg index for peak power climbed $20.45 from
yesterday to $61.88, with trades completed at $57.00-
$65.00.
     Traders said power prices were rising with the return
of heavier weekday loads and uncertainty over whether or
not all generation currently available will be operating
after the weekend.
     "Even though temperatures have been near normal, they
should increase next week, which will boost air-
conditioning load in the Southwest,'' said one Southwest
trader.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California,
peak power increased $15.56 to a Bloomberg index of $63.44,
with sales completed at $55.00-$69.00
     In the Southwest, power prices jumped an average of
$22.86 at the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average
of $75.00 amid trades in the $67.00-$85.00 range.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp., temperatures in Phoenix were expected to
peak today at 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Soar Ahead of Warm Weather Forecast

     Philadelphia, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Next-day power
prices rocketed to monthly highs throughout the Northeast U.S.
this morning on anticipated higher weather-related cooling loads,
traders said.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection,
power scheduled for Monday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $39.60 per megawatt hour, up $9.22, or
30.3 percent, from yesterday.
     Traders said early morning deals were executed as high as
$41.75, before trailing off to lows of $39.00 prior to daily
options expiration, or 10 a.m. local time.
     According to Weather Services Corp. of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Philadelphia and Baltimore, two of
the regions primary load centers, will peak at 82 and 81 degrees
Fahrenheit Monday, respectively.
     Next-week packages also sold higher in anticipation of
increased cooling loads, though traders said the market was very
volatile, representative of continued skepticism about conflicting
weather forecasts. Parcels for June 11-15 traded as high as $47.00
and as low as $43.50.
     "Some people are still feeling skiddish about these
forecasts," said one PJM-based trader. "Weather's not an exact
science. A lot of people are buying into the hype, but others are
holding out until the heat actually materializes."
     In the New England Power Pool, for-Monday power was assessed
$4.95 higher at an index price of $41.70. Trades spanned a tight
range of $41.50-$42.00, with most deals completed on the lower
end, marketers said.
     New England traders cited strong real-time prices and rising
temperatures as the primary reasons for the climb.
     "In spite of healthy generation in the pool, we've seen
comparatively strong prints [or real-time prices]," said one
trader. "While temperatures have yet to do anything impressive, no
one's willing to short themselves. This early in the season, you
can afford to go flat to long."

Warmer Monday Forecast Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Higher

     Cincinnati, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Prices for peak
power delivered Monday in the Mid-Continent U.S. climbed today as
warmer weather boosted demand from the South, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered into the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $10.04 to
$41.44 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $45.00 down to
$35.00 after options expired.
     East Central Area Reliability Council traders said the
Cinergy market opened at $44.00 on the strength of yesterday's
next-week market, then rose to the day's high amid buying
pressure from marketers.
     Traders said once prices hit $45.00, players began selling
excess power to the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, where hot
weather forecasts boosted demand for imports. As utilities in TVA
filled positions and buyer interest lessened, prices plunged.
     Concerns about weather-related demand also pushed short-term
over-the-counter prices up, as power for Tuesday-Friday delivery
next week was offered as high as $46.50. However, traders said
with recent inaccurate weather forecasts, the market could either
rise or fall next week.
     "It could get hot. That's the main concern," an ECAR trader
said. "There's a lot of variables though. If the weather comes in
and we get into the gas stack, we could see $60 power. If not, we
could see $30 power. It's going to be interesting."
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, for-Monday power
at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub again traded at a
discount to Cinergy, climbing $9.60 to $35.00-$44.00 as
temperatures weren't expected to be as high as in Cincinnati.
     "We've still got 50-something degree lake water, and if the
breeze blows off the lake into the city, its definitely going to
be cooler here than at Cinergy," one trader said.
     Power in lower MAIN sold $10.84 higher on average at $38.00-
$46.00 amid heavy demand from the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp.
grid, where Monday parcels sold $10.72 higher at $41.00-$51.00,
traders said.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool day-ahead power sold higher
again today, though transmission problems limited volume in the
region, traders said.
     For-Monday parcels traded $13.17 higher on average at
$37.00-$42.00 in northern MAPP and $11.93 higher on average at
$38.00-$45.00 in the southern half of the region.
     "It's going to be warmer down in SPP (the Southwest Power
Pool) than it is here, so everyone wants to export," a MAPP
trader said. "The problem is, we don't know how transmission will
hold up, so no one is selling as much as they'd like."

Most Southeast Power Prices Climb With Weekend Risk, Weather

     Nashville, Tennessee, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot
electricity prices for power delivered Monday rose throughout
most of the Southeast U.S. because of weekend risk premiums
associated with forecasts for warmer weather, traders said.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted high temperatures would be 89 degrees Fahrenheit in
Nashville and 91 degrees in New Orleans Monday.
     Electricity parcels for delivery Monday into the Tennessee
Valley Authority transmission grid traded at $37.00-$47.00 a
megawatt-hour, with the Bloomberg index price at $43.06, up
$10.89 from yesterday.
     Traders said strong prices at the Cincinnati-based Cinergy
Corp. grid, a primary source of import power, caused TVA to open
with high trades. As utilities filled positions, prices dropped.
     On the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. grid, for-Monday
power sold $10.72 higher on average, with the market opening at
$51.00 and trading down to $41.00 after options expiration.
     Market conditions at Entergy were similar to those at TVA,
though traders said transmission problems complicated their
attempts to import power from the north.
     Although prices at both the TVA and Entergy hubs fell during
the day, traders said the market could recover and trade up
Monday if temperature forecasts are accurate and typical
transmission problems occur, limiting imports from the Midwest.
     "The last time you had a lot of people in the Southeast
buying from Cinergy, TLRs (Transmission Line Loading Relief
measures) kicked in when delivery started," one trader said.
     "If that were to happen again, things could very well take
off, because we'd be getting into gas to meet the load we're
expecting," he said.
     The exception to higher prices was the Florida-Georgia
border market, where peak power for Monday delivery sold $6.00
less on average at $37.50-$38.50.
     Traders there said transmission problems eliminated the
ability to move power into Florida, causing prices at the border
to separate from the in-state market.
     With imports unavailable, peak in-state parcels traded up
$2.50 at $62.50-$63.50 because of increased reliance by utilities
on high-priced, gas-fired power to meet heavy cooling demand.
     Temperatures in much of the state were forecast in the low-
90 degrees Monday, according to Weather Services.

U.K. Power Prices Little Changed in Limited Activity

     London, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K
were little changed today amid lackluster trade ahead of the
weekend, traders said.
     August baseload traded 5 pence lower at 17.65 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Winter 2001/02 baseload remained unchanged following trades
at 21.28 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     In the spot market, week-ahead prices gained ground following
heavy buying interest by few counter parties indicating a
potential power plant outage, traders said, although this could
not be confirmed.
     "It was a very thin market, and buying seems to have come
from one particular direction," one trader said.
     Week-ahead prices gained 40 pence following trades at 18
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Moreover, forecasts for colder weather also boosted weekend
prices, traders said.
     Weekend traded 10 pence higher, following trades at 16.85
pounds a megawatt-hour.

Nordic Electricity Prices Tumble on Unexpectedly Abundant Rain

     Lysaker, Norway, June 8 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed
lower today after above-average precipitation yesterday renewing
expectations of increased hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2, 2001 traded 297.00 megawatts at 222.25-224.25
kroner a megawatt-hour, down 0.70 kroner. Winter-1, 2002 also fell
after 127.00 megawatts were exchanged between 228.25-230.50 kroner
a megawatt-hour, 0.25 kroner lower.
     Yesterday, rainfall amounted to 2 terawatt-hours, exceeding
most forecasts, a trader said.
     Saturday's system area average price fell less than expected
to 200.37 kroner a megawatt-hour, only 8.08 kroner lower than
today's price. A "much lower'' spot price was anticipated for
Sunday to compensate for tomorrow's "wrong price,'' an Oslo-based
trader said.
     Renewed selling interest also came after marketers sold
previously bought contracts in an attempt to profit from higher
prices earlier this week.
     "Although forecasts are drier for next week, it's a good
opportunity for participants holding an excess of contracts to
sell them at very profitable prices,'' a Stockholm-based trader
said earlier today.
Across Scandinavia, below-normal rainfall was anticipated
over the next 5 days, according to Weather Services Corp. in the
U.S.
Shorter-term contracts also fell. Week 24 shed 0.50 kroner to
close at 208.25-211.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 285.00
megawatts traded.
Total trade volumes were little changed today at 2,819
gigawatt-hours generation, compared to yesterday's 2,827 gigawatt-
hours.

We exited the Rydex Tempest Fund. We would advise you to do so as well. It's about time for a bounce and we shouldn't be greedy. Rydex trades these funds in the morning, so there should be little difficulty exiting. The Gold stocks are looking a bit toppy, so we may take a profit on strength tomorrow.
Our managed tracking account is up 16.98% for the 18 months since June 30, 2000. This is a very conservative approach (~1/3 the risk of the market), using both long and short funds as well as the occasional favored sector/stock idea. All performance is net of fees, commissions, and interest. Your results may vary, and standard disclaimers may apply. We DO use discretion. For further information, call us now.

**********************************
Last time, I said that a rally could materialize, but i didn't have absolutely compelling reason to expect it to occur or that it will be much to write home about, as yet. That was probably about the best one could call it. The market is not giving us much help, but it certainly seems to be lack lustre.
The market can still rally, and a rally of some sort is due right about now, but so far, nothing is getting going. Oversold indicators are now starting to get up to levels that bring rallies. The same is true with shorter-term sentiment. The VIX is up at the top of it's Bollinger Bands, which usually brings some buying (the bands define the likely range of an indicator--right now the VIX shows pessimism at relatively high levels). The Rydex Ratios show a significant excess of Bearish fund buying as well. The problem is, nothing is showing any really fear. All I am seeing is a bit too much Bearish consensus among aggressive traders
If we get a terrifying collapse tomorrow, early, we would be inclined to buy any solid reversal for a quick trade. I would definitely cover up shorts. If the market opens strong, I would be very inclined to look for a failure. Considering the damage that has been done to this market, I'm a bit surprised that we don't have more folks scared. If we get that fear factor, however, we can look for some higher prices for at least a few days. If we don't see that fear, I'll be inclined to load up on the shorts.
Big picture, there's no reason to go long. Seasonally, however, it makes sense to take quick profits in shorts, as it is usually hard to get a big down move that isn't met with serious buying along the way. If I am making money on the short side during the positive seasonal period, I know to not be greedy.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

If there is any movement of these people between groups can you plese keep me in the loop.

Kind regards,

Joe:

The description looks fine to me.  What it says to me with respect to penalties is that the Seller may be responsible for penalties for failure to deliver.  I may be wrong, but what I thought you were trying to say is:

		Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in the event that penalties or
		charges (in cash or in kind) are assessed as a result of Seller's failure to 
		nominate and deliver the Daily Contract Quantit;y, Seller shall be responsible 
		for paying such penalties or charges.

As you may have heard, Dell is voluntarily recalling certain batteries from some of the Dell Inspiron laptops.  The recalled batteries were sold with the Inspiron 5000 series notebook computers, comprising both the Inspiron 5000 and the Inspiron 5000e models (please see the bottom of your computer for model ID).  The systems and/or batteries were shipped to customers between January 7, 2000 and March 21, 2001.

As a result, you will have the opportunity to return your battery in exchange for a new one.  We appreciate your patience through this process.  Dell is committed to your continued service and is sincerely apologetic for the situation.

Please visit  http://support.dell.com/i5000battery/, or call Dell at 866-220-3355 for further information.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hi Scott,

Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading Track,   as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a step down.   From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the trading track as a manager?   I am meeting with him today to discuss the TT in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you have time.

Thanks, Karen.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management
Factiva, a Dow Jones & Reuters Company

Hello all,

In an effort to make rate information more accessible, I have created Rate Cheatsheets for Transco, ANR and Transwestern.  The chestsheets include rates for basic Firm and Interruptible transportation service as well as fuel percentages, surcharges, cash out provisions and overrun information. 

More pipelines will be added in the near future.  Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

John Hodge requested some information from Scott Neal.

He would like to see the # of counterparties we did physical trades with in the year 2000 and the volumes by month (sales) in New Jersey.

There are two Notional curves (locations) that are in New Jersey.  IF-TETCO/M3 and TRANSCO/Z6NONNY.


I cannot find any old files from Nagesh but I just need to see the volumes for the year and the number of counterparties.  I don't need to see the counterparty names just the number of counterparties for the year.

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference.

thanks,

Scott

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John

Scott,

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Kim

John/Kim/David

Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlier - vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a scheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.

They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)

Does the 23rd work ?

I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.

Neil

	Andy,

	This will update you on this matter.  You may recall that it is a collection matter for about $1,800,000 for breach of spot gas purchase contracts by Triad.  We tried to arbitrate, but Triad wouldn't answer the arbitration (even though I got calls from Purnell afterward, who asked if there was some way we could settle the arbitration).  We then filed suit in the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against both Triad and Purnell, to see if that would smoke them out.  

	As you know, after filing our original petition, we found an inadvertant technical error in it that required correction, and at no charge to you refiled a first amended petition that corrected the error.  Since then, we served the first amended petition and citations on the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, as is allowed by law under such circumstances.  The Secretary of State then forwarded the first amended petition and citations to the addresses we gave them, by certified mail, r.r.r.  At this time, which is long after the expiration of the answer date, no certified mail receipt has reportedly been received by the Secretary of State from Purnell or Triad.  No answer or other pleading has been filed by Triad or Purnell.

	This is not unexpected, given that Triad dodged us during the attempted arbitration.  The caselaw supports the position that we have made effective service on both Triad and Purnell, although there is some room to argue that the Secretary of State has to receive a green card back, even if it is marked "refused".  If we wanted to try to nail this point down by going to the additional expense of personal service on Triad and Purnell, we could, but if Purnell is not going to respond to registered mail, he will likely attempt to dodge personal service as well.  I am not recommending it.

	We will shortly receive from the Secretary of State the so-called "Whitney Certificate" and file-stamped copies of the citations, which we will file with the court, along with a motion for entry of default judgment.  I will make sure you see a draft before it is filed.

	We will need to set a hearing on our motion, and produce evidence of our damages.  I would not expect the hearing to take more than an hour.  We previously filed an affidavit signed by Bryce, as well as a matrix for computing our prejudgment interest (given that there were many spot gas sales, and prejudgement interest as to each would start at different times) prepared by Shielah Castro.  I will follow up with them to see if they would be willing and available to come with me to testify at the hearing, and will of course fully prepare them beforehand.  Also, I will need to testify regarding our attorneys' fees in this matter.

	Parenthetically, given the length of time this matter has been on file, it has been routinely set on the dismissal for want of prosecution docket.  As you know, it is merely a formality and I will file the appropriate motion to get this taken care of.  I will send you a draft of that if you wish.  A hearing is set on this docket for October 23, at which time I presently have a conflict, and Bonnie has kindly agreed to attend in my place if necessary.  No one else need be at that hearing.

	Please let me know if there is anyone else who needs to be in the loop on this.
	
	I will keep you advised.

Scott - 

I think we are going to move the afternoon start time to 4pm rather than 3pm.

I would love to still come down and sit with you one morning...is there any day this week that works for you?

Thanks so much!

Adrianne

I think most of you know that we gave Jeff a gift certificate for Forno's,
which came with a free night of babysitting, by me.  We also gave trophies
to the assistant coaches.  I know some of you have reimbursed me.  If you
have not and would like to do so, (naturally, it is purely voluntary),
please send $10 to:

	Team,
	I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this 
	concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their decision any day now 
	and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our 
	dependence on the minimum load factor.  

	I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
	I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum.  
	I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today.  

	I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving ASAP.  

	Thanks,
	mk

Subject:	Structure for Storage Loans / Deferred Payment Deals


The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,
Edie

Forward to FL distribution list.

Note:  The Florida legislative session ends May 4.  It is highly unlikely that any action will be taken on wholesale electric deregulation this session. 

I spoke to a staff member of the House Utility and Telecommunication Committee yesterday and she informed me that they are starting the process for an interim legislative study to expand on the interim report prepared by the 2020 Study Commission (specifically the "stranded benefits" issue).

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Pre Flight Checklist for 2/07/02
Wednesday 2/6
Intermediate-term Outlook (weeks):
Seasonal Cycles: Positive.
Coppock Breadth Indicator: Negative.
Weekly MACD: Negative.
Conclusion: The only thing favoring longs is the Seasonal Cycle The trend is down, breadth is negative, and we remain in a Bear Market. Shorts are favored with the caveat that declines during this part of the cycle are likely to be choppy. Don't be shy about taking quick profits on shorts. We remain Intermediate-term BEARS.
Short/Intermediate-Term
ITBM: Negative.
Tuma Ammia: Neutral. Pending Buy.
VIX Daily: Neutral. Pending Buy.
CCI Daily: Buy.
10-day ARMS: Positive. This could be more important. Keep an eye on this.
MACD Daily: Negative.
Senticator: Neutral.
Conclusion: Shorts are favored by the trend, and the ITBM. The CCI suggest a bounce is coming, and so does the daily stochastic. We are nearing bounce time. The sooner it comes, the weaker it will be.
Short-term
Tuma Ammia Turn Spotter: Still Neutral.
VIX 30': Neutral. Chopping.
MACD 60': Neutral.
Moving Averages: Negative. Watch the SPX 1100-1103 area.
Conclusion: Shorts are favored. The VIX 30' hints at a turn but it's mighty flat. Hourly MACD is close to a buy, but it can turn right back down. Use care if you probe for a low.
*******************************
Last time, I said that the market could collapse or rally, but if it did, it would likely not be too impressive.
We said we were looking for the lower risk pattern of a hard down and then a high volume reversal. We just can't seem to get it. We still are looking for it, however. If we get a hard down tomorrow morning, and it scares enough folks, we'll probably see a tradable low. If the market starts a rally without a hard sell off, we'd view it VERY skeptically.
 
Our problem child, JILL rallied well today, and is now nearing a double top formation. The stock has relative strength, so being short isn't much fun or perhaps even a good idea. If the double top is exceeded, it's probably time to cover. We can always revisit.
*****************
OPTION TRADING SUMMARY:
Trading action: None, but be alert for a PUT Credit Spread idea, if we tank hard tomorrow.
Current Positions: None.
Past performance is not an indication of future returns. Options trading is not only risky, but also entails unique risks. Traders can lose a significant amount of money trading options, and should discuss this with their broker before taking any trades.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport:	transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:		write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:		Kam to review and explain
Annuity:				Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:			Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:				As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be transferred for the
				account of Jared Kaiser
				 	      Bank of America
					      ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too long.

Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.  As well, please reply if I have not covered all issues.


Regards,

Jared

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Scott,

As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.

Just to give you some facts:
We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper. 

We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it.
Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.

Credit: Trey Skelton @ 918-573-5662 and Tim Neuman @ 918-573-4880
Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278

Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.
If you have any questions, please call me x54099.
Many thanks for your help !
Best Regards
Ellen

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

October 12, 2001

Re:  DTI Changes Effective 11/1/01

On September 21, 2001, Dominion Transmission, Inc. (DTI) 
filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-632 in order 
to implement its Settlement which was approved by the 
Commission in a letter order issued September 13, 2001.  DTI 
anticipates an effective date of November 1, 2001.  Included 
in DTI's filing are revised rates under its Rate Schedule 
GSS which Transco uses to render service to its customers 
under its Rate Schedules LSS and GSS. If accepted as 
proposed, the revised DTI rates would result in the 
following changes to Transco's current Rate Schedules LSS

The filing reflects a phased conversion of Rate Schedule

effective date of November 1, 2001. Included in DTI's filing 
are revised rates under its Rate Schedule GSS which Transco 
uses to render service to its customers under its Rate 
Schedules LSS and GSS. If accepted as proposed, the revised

Cost Adjustment.  Included in DTI's filing are revised rates 
under its Rate Schedule GSS which Transco uses to render

On September 28, 2001, DTI also filed revised tariff sheets 
in Docket No. RP01-626 in order to update its Transportation 
Cost Rate Adjustment.  Included in DTI's filing are revised

DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal (2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  Sorry for the trouble.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.


Thanks,

Kam

	Becky,

	This will confirm our conversation.  You will make the redrafting changes necessary on the petition and attachments to file in Harris County court, and have everything ready for us to file on Monday. Once service is ready, we will then serve the Secretary of State  of Texas (I may go ahead and have a process server do that for us, to prevent any questions about proper service later on).  Keep your fingers crossed and let's hope that Sherwood Purnell doesn't try to dodge the Secretary of State.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.--Lee, we already have the check cut to pay for filing, etc., but get with Becky today and take a look, just to make sure it appears to be in the proper amount.  If it is not, let's order a check in the right amount today.  Thanks.

PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its
latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx)
RECLAIM Market."  On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District
Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx
RECLAIM market at least until 2004. However, their actions to date have left
the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an
ongoing, extremely tight market balance.

A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit
Market will be released shortly.

Non-EMIS clients interested in the latest RECLAIM report can purchase it for
$2,000. The annual fee for quarterly EMIS reports is $4,500 for up to 10
users at one client site (office).

For more information, please contact Victoria Watkins at (212) 686-6808,

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of me.  Thanks.

Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!

Kelli

Please respond to Thanks, Barry. We have all been too busy to get up there. I went ahead and
filed misdeamenor charges against John Cloud.
Let me know how much we owe you for supplies such as gasoline, window
materials, etc. Thanks again,

BQ - 
You're still in Houston.  There hasn't been a sighting of you in years. Do they have you down in the cellar and only let you out once a week.   
By the way if Bolger had e-mail he'd tell you he's divorced, gets drunk almost every night and needs a job.  Some things never change.

Please review. =20


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =
 =20

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
 same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=
er.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen   =20

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Do you have a package on this property or pictures?
Are there any improvements on the property - house, barn, pens?

Thanks,

Western Spot Power Prices Sink Amid River Runoff, Mild Weather

     Portland, Oregon, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S.
peak spot power prices for delivery tomorrow plummeted as
hydroelectric operators were forced to generate power, traders
said.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
declined 38.4 percent from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$140.55 a megawatt hour, with executed trades between $135.00-
$150.00.
     "Run-off is increasing hydroelectric supplies," said one
Northwest trader.
     Traders said that smaller dams in the Portland area don't
have the capability to store excess water from mountain snowmelt,
so they have to generate power or spill water.
     "The weather is mild in the Northwest, causing snow melt to
run off into the reservoirs," said one Northwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Portland, Oregon were expected to
reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 65 degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power sank
$106.67 to a Bloomberg index of $140.00. Traders completed trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.
     In the Pacific Northwest, federal power marketer Bonneville
Power Administration offered up to 200 megawatts of delivered
energy for tomorrow at the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia and California-
Oregon Border firm electricity index price.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power slipped
$72.20, to a Bloomberg index of $150.92 as traders executed
transactions in the $140.50-$150.00 range. Traders said they sold
off-peak power as low as $21.00 and as high as $40.00.
     Traders said that Arizona Public Service Co.'s 1,270-
megawatt Palo Verde 1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona,
increased production 20 percent from yesterday to 70 percent of
capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage
that began March 31.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power slumped $73.33 to a Bloomberg index of $139.67 amid trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Steady Amid Idle Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power prices
in the Northeast U.S. were little changed this morning, amid
expectations for continued increases in available generation and
stagnant cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demands 89 and 97 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Thursday delivery was assessed 65 cents
higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $33.80 per
megawatt hour.
     Traders said tomorrow's projected load requirements and
generation outages were virtually unchanged, leaving little room
for movement in the day-ahead market.
     The Interconnection projected loads for the first six on-peak
hours of tomorrow to average just 100 megawatts greater than
today, and increases in available generation were estimated at
only 23 megawatts.
     The next-week market was volatile however, as revised weather
forecasts, calling for cooler temperatures, left many marketers
scrambling to readjust positions.
     "The weather forecast for next-week has been drastically
revised," said one PJM-based trader. "Anyone holding excess power
for that period was looking to unload it this morning, and the
market just fell out of bed from there."
     Traders said early morning trades topped out at $48.00,
before trailing off to lows in the $40.00-$41.00 range.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead power sold 25 cents
lower amid trades in the $51.50-$52.50 range, with most deals
executed at $52.00.
     Entergy Corp. said it began the process of restarting its
670-megawatt Pilgrim 1 nuclear reactor at 3:07 a.m., although
traders agreed the additional megawatts didn't affect tomorrow's
market.
     "It's not a very big unit, so a minimal increase in
production isn't going to make a noticeable difference," said one
Northeast trader. "I'm sure it will be reflected in tomorrow's
day-ahead market, when output will be closer to capacity."
     Next-week packages traded heavily in New England, as they did
in PJM, though prices for the 5-day block there remained firm at
$55.00. Traders said heavy purchases from one of the region's load
serving entities might have helped support the market, by
offsetting forecasts for cooler temperatures.
     Temperatures in Boston, one of New England's primary load
centers, are forecast to average less than 60 degrees through the
early part of next week.

Southeast Demand Again Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Continued high
weather-related demand from the Southeast and a combination of
unit outages and transmission problems in the Midwest drove Mid-
Continent peak power prices up again today, traders said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council prices rose for the
fourth consecutive day as heavy weather-related demand from the
Tennessee Valley Authority grid continued, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for day-ahead power delivered into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $6.11
to $46.25 a megawatt-hour and has gained almost $19.00 this week.
Trades ranged from $44.50 up to $50.00 after options expiration.
     Cinergy traders said the late price rise came as marketers
oversold to TVA and had to buy power back from there to cover
short positions.
     In contrast to the daily market, short-term over-the-counter
prices dropped, with power for Friday delivery offered $2.00 less
than yesterday's price for Thursday-Friday parcels at $41.00 and
power for delivery from May 21-25 offered $7.00 less at $40.50.
     "There's a new weather forecast out, and it's going to be a
lot cooler next week now than we originally thought," one trader
said. "I wish I'd sold myself way short on the next week package
yesterday, but what can you do?"
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.46 higher on
average at $40.00-$46.00 and power in the lower half of the
region $2.79 higher on average at $46.00-$52.00.
     MAIN traders said transmission constraints all but
eliminated the ability to sell power west into the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, causing market focus to shift to the South and
East.
     With several unit outages and transmission problems,
continued hot weather and imports from MAIN unavailable, day-
ahead power prices in MAPP were the highest in the region again
today, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.00 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $50.00-$55.00 and 33 cents higher in the southern half of the
region at $50.00-$55.00. Traders said activity was limited, as
most utilities had no excess power available.
     "It's still in the 80s (degrees) here, which is much hotter
than we're used to this early in the year," one trader said. "Add
to that these unit outages, and you get what we have right now; a
pretty big mess."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Recent Heat Moderates

     Atlanta, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as several major regional
population centers expected cooler weather tomorrow, while
others expected weather to remain hot, utility traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose an average of 39 cents a megawatt-
hour from equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today,
to $47.77, amid trades in the $36.50-$60.00 range.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit,
unchanged from today's projected high.
     In sections of the Southwest Power Pool, tomorrow's
projected highs for Topeka, Kansas, were expected to decline to
the high-70s to low-80s tomorrow, utility traders said.
     "There was not a lot of trading done in the next-day
markets because we expect to see a break in the weather," said
one SPP-based utility trader. "Our temperatures, which are
expected to hit the 92-94 degree mark today, will decline to
about 10 degrees below normal tomorrow."
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about normal over the next week.
     Over the next 6-10 days, temperatures in the Southeast are
expected to average 3.1 degrees below normal, the forecaster
said.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power for tomorrow
traded in a "broad" range of $40.00-$53.00, though the majority
of energy trades were reported at a Bloomberg index of $44.57,
24 cents more than yesterday.
     Expectations for continued warm weather on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and troubling transmission line loading relief measures
between sections of southern Mid-Continent Area Power Pool and
the northern SPP, kept Entergy Corp. prices from falling,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg day-ahead peak Entergy index fell 2 cents
from yesterday to $49.73 amid trades in the $45.00-$55.00
range.
     Traders said prices could dip tomorrow in the Gulf Coast
region because natural gas futures for June delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange were slipping. June futures declined
28.3 cents per million British thermal units to $4.38 per
million Btu.

U.K. Winter Power Contracts Little Changed in Heavy Trade

     London, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Winter 2001 power prices
in the U.K. closed little changed today, although the contract was
unusually active, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload was last assessed 10 pence lower at
21.30-21.40 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although Winter 2001 traded over 60 times, one trader said
the contract traded "range-bound'' throughout the day, as
participants purchased and sold the contract in an effort to
create liquidity in the market.
     "Its unprecedented for over 800 megawatts to have traded and
we've seen little change. It's evident a player out there is very
keen to get liquidity going in the market,'' another trader said.
     Traders said the two major trading houses that have been
trading the contract aggressively over the past week were the main
market participants again today.
     Day-ahead prices tumbled today even though reports of outage
problems persisted, traders said.
     British Energy's Sizewell B nuclear plant was reported to
have shut for maintenance last Friday because of an acid leak,
although this couldn't be confirmed.
     "The spot market continued to be volatile. We are still
seeing a lot of panic buying and selling,'' one trader said. "It
seems people must have overbought in preparation for these planned
outages and now need to sell.''
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 23.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before plummeting to trade at 18.00 pounds a megawatt-hour,
5.00 pounds lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Scott,

Here is the unwind structure for 7500/MMBtu of the Boston Gas deal.  Could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal.  I would like to include Gerry and Howard from our Calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of Cal pine.  Below is a couple of slides that show the unwind.

Regards,

Jon

After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I appreciate it.

Steve

this program, Manager assessment, Direct Report
assessment, or Colleague/Peer assessment) will be
combined with the input of others and used by the
program participant to develop an action plan to
improve his/her management styles and practices.  If
you are providing feedback as a Manager of the

identified in the summary report.

It is important that you complete this assessment NO
LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS on Tuesday, May 1, 2001.

To begin the online administration process, you will

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________
To download the software:
1)  Visit the ClickAtHome Portal at www.clickathome.net from your ClickAtHome PC.
2)  Logon to the Portal with your personally created Portal User ID and Password, or create a new account if you have not created a user ID and password by selecting "Create a NEW Account" at the top left corner.  The Portal User IDs and Passwords are created by you.  The Enron Help Desk is not able to assist with Portal support, but if you need any assistance, please send an email to "clickathome@enron.com".
3) Once you have logged on, select "Tools" from the top menu bar.
4) Under the "Secure Download" heading, click on "BlackICE" or "Norton" and log on to the download page using your SAP ID and Date of Birth.
5) Follow the directions provided on screen.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

Joann ---

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and update it daily?

Scott
