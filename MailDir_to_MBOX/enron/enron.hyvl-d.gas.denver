Dan

Could you review a couple changes I made to Yates' Gathering Agreement (due 
to some operational differences of this area vs. their current area)


Thanks

I'm forwarding these comments to the Mortgage Agreement from Quantum for your 
review.  I'm not very familiar with Mortgage/credit - type issues, but let's 
discuss our responses at your convenience.

Thx

Subject: Bonepile:  WHGGS Mortgage 



Dan,
Per our discussion this am.

Mortage concerns:
 B. Recitals:  we want to make clear that the term loan amount can be
"up to" $750,000 as opposed to "is" $750,000.

 1.1:   Mortgagors need to be defined as all working interest owners
in the leases and not the royalty or overriding
 royalty owners.  Also stipulate that ownership of the Wellhead Gas
Gathering System (WHGGS) ownership is
 identical to the leasehold working interest ownership.  Here again
Quantum will need to sign on behalf of itself and as
 agent for its program investors.  EOW will sign for itself.  The
nonworking interest owners will also need to sign for
 themselves.

 1.2.b:  Again stipulate that RI and ORRI owners not subject to
mortgage or that all leasehold working interest owners
 are bound.

 2.1:  Mortgagee would be the assignee in this provision.   We need
clarification on the ramifications of the assignment
 being absolute.

 2.4:  No duty of Mortgagee to produce rents is too much control to
give Mortgagee even in theory.

 3.1:  Stipulate that lien affects only leasehold working interest
owners.

 5.5.1:  Again mortgagor needs to be well defined.

 5.1.(b):  Enernet of Wyoming (EOW) has granted a mortgage to secure
the operations bond required by the Wyoming
 Office of State Lands and Investments in the amount of $10,000.
This mortgage is a permitted exception hereto.
 EOW has also file of record AAPL Model Form 610RS-1989 Recording
Supplement to the JOA and Financing Statement
 in the ordinary course of business.

 5.4:  The loss threshhold should probably need to be increased in
light of the funding amount involved.

 7.3:  The personal liability language referenced in this provision
appears inconsistent with the in rem nature of the
 mortage and therefore out of place.


Dan, let me know when we can talk with you and/or your counsel on these
matters.

Thanks,
Doug

Dan,

Here is the latest Westport contract with a few changes I need you to take a 
look at.
Also, in Section 8, what are payment securities? They would like this to be 
defined.
They also would like Section 9 to be bi-lateral.

One other question Westport has is - If the delivery point (screw compressor 
meter) is off the acreage lease, can all the fees be charged back to the 
royalty owners?
I told them you may not want to give an opinion on this and they are alright 
with that.

Let me know your thoughts on all the above.

Mike

Dan,

Attached is a redlined version of a purchase agreement for True Oil Company. 
Please review and let me know what's good and what's not.

NOTES:

True Oil will probably become an LLC sometime this year.  Does that change 
anything?

In Article 3.2 - True would like to know why that should be in there if we 
are not lending money to them and they do not owe us money.

Article 3.4 - I added this. They would like some language added that gives 
them the right to put compression in at their expense and the purchase price 
re-negotiated should this article come into play.

Article 5 Force Majeure - Why is force majeure here and in the definitions? 
Can one or the other be deleted??

Article 7.3 - True would like to know why there are set-offs here if we owe 
them.

Article 7.4 - Is this paragraph necessary? Supposedly, True has not seen this 
paragraph in any other contract.

Article 7.5 - filing of the Notice of Gas Contract - Where would this be 
filed and why?

General Provisions - Seller's Representative Matters - I assume that the 
first sentence, "authorized agent.....", takes care of the Committed Reserses 
that True does not have 100% ownership to. In other words, they cannot commit 
ownership that they do not have.

Exhibit F - I added this Exhibit. The very last sentence about pulsation. If 
ENA is purchasing the gas at the inlet of the screw compressor....we are 
supplying the compression, should this be deleted.


Call with any questions, comments, concerns or if you just want to say HI !!!


Take care,
Mike

Dan,
The Campbell county clerk refused to record the State of WY Lease because it
does not contain an acknowledgment.  The clerk, however, said that they
would record a certified copy.  The State Land Office no longer provides
certified copies of their oil and gas leases, ergo, we could not record a
certified copy of the lease.

If you want to record the lease, I'll have Gregg Colton at Pioneer Oil and
Gas send the original lease to you to be recorded as an attachment to an
affadavit of identification.  At this stage of the process, I think it more
expeditious for you to control that process too.

Short of recording the lease, you can confirm the ownership of the lease
through the WY Office of State Lands and Investments, Phone # 307 777 7331;
fax 307 777 5400; email slfmail@missc.state.wy.us.

EOW can send it for recording also as an attachment to an affadavit but the
recording process is slow in the county because of the tremendous volume of
recording transactions ie., 2 weeks plus.

Your call.

     Can you please forward to me the other recording info that you have on
the Enernet lease so that I can update the info on the mortgage.  My
counsel in Wyoming indicates that they won't get me a response until next
week and I would like to put the mortgage exhibit in final form as quickly
as possible.  Please call me at 713-853-6895 if you have any questions.

Do you have a problem calling Howard Hertzburg (Coleman's attorney) directly 
to answer his questions regarding the indemnity provisions regarding 
preserving the non-jurisdictional status / FERC / etc.?  This will really 
speed things up.

I know you are going to communicate with Coleman's attorney to answer his 
(hopefully) final concerns.  I have attached the gathering services primarily 
to remind you of the remaining change requested by Jim Anderson, my 
counterpart at Coleman.

However, I do have one last item to discuss with you that I hope we can 
handle just in the definitions section, so after your contact with Coleman's 
attorney, give me a ring.

Yates asked us to prepare amendments to the referenced agreements to include 
their West Kitty prospect under the current agreement.  (Of course, if its 
easier, you could create another document).  Here are the particulars:


Reserve Commitment Area  --  Section 36 of 51N/74W 

Gathering Services Fee = $0.21 per Mcf

Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) = 6,000 Mcf/d

Purchase Price  (i) baseload  IFGMR CIG Index less $0.04
  (ii) swing  Gas Daily CIG Index less $0.04

Let me know how you would like to proceed (amendment v. separate contract) 
and if you need additional info.


Thanks.

Dan,
It would probably be better to date the mortgage when signed.
Dan Bump and I talked about the date and it seems that the date here is used
as an identifier of the Enron mortgage.  If it only identifies and has no
other significance, it seems that the mortgage is sufficiently identified by
other references, i.e., GPA, GSA, property description etc, and that a date
is not necessary. Your call.

The description is simple.  There is one lease.  The lease covers all of
Section 16-48N-72W, Campbell County, WY less and except the SW SW thereof.
It would be a simple thing to attach a copy of the lease to all agreements
including the "Enron" WHGGS Mortgage.

I believe Dan Bump has a copy of the lease.  If not, I can send copies to
both you and Dan Bump.

Please email a clean copy of mortgage as modified by your redline version
and I will get the bank to execute, fax you a copy of the executed mortgage
and overnight the original to you.

Let me know by reply email what the plan is for wrapping up.

Thanks,
Doug

Doug,
     Attached is a red-lined version of the lien subordination form which
has been modified by Wyoming counsel.  The document refers to the Enron
mortgage as being dated December 20, 1999.  Is this correct, or will the
mortgage be dated when it is signed?   Also, is the property description
the same as it is to be in the Enron mortgage document.  If so, if will
advise Wyoming counsel to speed up the record search.

(See attached file: result~1.doc)

Dan,

Here is a redlined version from Westport.
I have not looked at it yet, except I see they want to call this 
Transportation service.
I'm sure this is a problem we will have to address.

Let me know what you think.

Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.

Bump/DEN/ECT@Enron 
Subject: FW: Mortgage Agreement



FYI,
The following was conveyed to Dan Bump via a telephone conversation:

 In order to operate in the states of WY and MT, Enernet of Wyoming,
LLC (EOW)
 executed 3 operating bonds (1) $10,000 bond to WY State Office of
Lands and Investments
 (2) $25,000 statewide operating bond in favor of the MT BLM and (3)
a $50,000 statewide  operating bond in favor of the MT Board of Oil and
Gas Conservation.

 BancFirst guaranteed the $25,000 MT BLM bond, $25,000 of the $50,000
MT State bond and
 the $10,000 WY State Lands bond.  BancFirst required EOW to execute
two $25,000 promissory
 notes to secure the banks guarantees.  Enernet, Inc., (50%
owner/member of EOW)and its owners  guaranteed the promissory notes for
the bank.

 EOW can immediately move to have one if not both of these promissory
notes cancelled in order
 not to impede the mortgage transaction with Enron.  Alternatively,
in the very near future,
 EOW will transfer all of its operated properties in MT to the new
operating entity currently  being formed by Quantum and US Energy.  When
the new operating entity is in place, EOW will
 immediatedly transfer operations on all existing properties to the
new entity.  Once  operations are transfered EOW will request
cancellation of all MT bonding, which, will be
 appproved by the BLM and the MT State Board of Oil and Gas upon the
successful transfer of
 operations from EOW to the new entity.  With the MT bonds cancelled,
BancFirst will release
 the mortgage in question.

 EOW owns 2.5% of the Bonepile lease.

This should not be an obstacle in this transaction.  If Enron makes it one,
it can be taken out of
the equation.

The Enron record check in progress should reveal that 97.5% of the Bonepile
lease should be free
and clear of liens and encumbrances but for the JOA recording supplements
filed routinely by EOW and
other operators.

I will await the next communication from Dan Bump or Dan Hyvl.

Gentlemen:

Latest version of subject document attached for your review.

I've been told to advise you that Enron would like to do further due
diligence (e.g. credit analysis, etc.) to get comfortable with Enernet's
existing mortgage(s) to have a good understanding of the situation.  Same
me need to be done for Quantum.  In other words, the agreement below could
be amended based on further analysis.

I'll let you know if anything materializes other than a phone call from
Enron credit to Enernet for information.

Cathie,
Here is a suggested form of mortgage subordination.
Let me know if the form is OK with Ed.
By copy hereof I'm asking Dan Hyvl of Enron to review document as to form
and
requesting that Dan also let me know if the form is satisfactory.

When I get the OK from both Ed and Dan as to "form", I will complete the
agreement and
walk it over to Ed Alexander at BancFirst for execution.

Dan--

I reviewed the latest Quantum docs (on my machine) and I had only two 
revisions.

1)  In the purchase agreement, look at my note re: the definition of 
"Gathering Services" (its related to the following revision #2).

2)  In the gathering agreement, I adjusted the allocation between the 
compression portion of the total services rate and the gathering portion of 
the rate per Quantum's request.  I'm sorry the redlining of my revision did 
not happen, but I feel its correct.

Talk with you this afternoon.

Thanks.

Dan,

We have a customer - True Oil Company - that would like us to gather and buy 
their gas in the Powder River.
They do not want a gathering agreement. They only want a purchase agreement. 
They are willing to commit that the reserves will flow through Enron's 
facilities but do not want to sign a gathering agreement.
We do not want to purchase their gas for an agreed to rate for more than one 
year.
We want the reopener in the purchase agreement.
Their idea is that we would purchase the gas at CIG index minus $0._____ and 
if Enron is not purchasing the gas that a third party will have to 
pay/negotiate with Enron for the gathering.

The minus would include all gathering - field and Ft Union, fuel, shrink, 
margin, etc.

Do you have any thoughts on this??

Mike

Also, on the Appendix 1 of the purchase agreement - Force Majeure - I think 
we can take out the last line that talks about Y2K related problems.
On Exhibit D for Scott Sitter's address, the street number should come before 
Denver, Co - I know I did this!!!

Dan,

We may change the wire transfer to a check.......I am trying to find out why 
they don't want to use the wire transfer option.
On section 5, I do not want to add the proposed sentences.
Section 8, I am explaining to WestPort that this would only be done fo good 
and reasonable cause.
Section 9, Do we have a problem making the assignment language bi lateral??
Section 11, I am trying to find out why they want to add the sentence.

Mike,
 Are we sticking with wire transfer as the method for payment?  I assume that 
we are.
 Section 5 Pressures -  Is there any need to include the two sentences they 
proposed at the end of that section?  I assume there is not.
 I see no need to make any of the changes proposed in Sections 8,  9 & 11.  
Do you agree?
 Assuming you are okay with the above I have attached a revised contract both 
red-line and clean for your review.

Dan,

The breakout of $0.20 for field gathering, $0.15 for compression plus actual 
fuel and shrink, and $0.15 for Ft. Union gathering works for me.

The last line of Section 2.1 is a problem. We cannnot guarantee a Feb 15. 
date. I would like to put that we will endeavor to install the facilities as 
quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron
. 
Section 4.2 - I don't agree with 90 days......I would settle on 45 days.

In the General Terms and Conditions definitions we need to leave dehydrator 
fuel and dehydrating terms in under Equivalent Quantities and Gathering.
Under Quality the 6% by volume of total inerts must stay.

Let me know what you have a problem with.

Thanks,
Mike

Dan,

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Please see the attached which (I think) describes the improvements in Section 
16 of the Quantum deal.

In my (non-legal) opinion, if we include this document with the scematic of 
the collection facilities in Exhibit B or C of the Purchase/Gath documents, 
then will this suffice for Exhibit B of the Mortgage Agreement?

Thanks.

After meeting with Quantum, I have attached some suggested revisions to the

Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the 
money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have 
exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any 
existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are 
subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in 
Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing 
security interest.

Dan,

Westport Oil and Gas Company Inc has agreed to terms for Enron providing 
gathering from the inlet of screw compression to Glenrock.
I am faxing to you a term sheet so that we can get Westport a gathering 
agreement asap. You can use the latest Quantum agreement as a start.
We are NOT purchasing the gas.

Gregg,
We want to attach a copy of the Bonepile lease to the Enron Gas Purchase
Agreement.
EOW has copies of the lease and I think North American Petroleum LC kept the
original lease.
Could you please fax a copy of the lease to Dan Bump and to Dan Hyvl.
Copies made from our copies were not clear enough.

You might need to overnight a clean copy of the lease to Dan Bump at Enron
in Denver.
Dan can let you know if your faxed copy will suffice.

Dan Bump's fax 303 534 0552
Dan Hyvl's fax 713 646 3490

Thanks

Dan--

Quantum & Enernet have verbally agreed to the attached terms.  Per Shonnie's 
suggestion, I have forwarded the proposal to you in hopes that you could help 
to incoporate the terms into the definitive purchase and gathering 
documents.  I thought maybe we could use the latest Coleman documents as our 
"standard" to incorporate these terms...I think its the best one so far.

A couple notes: (1) Quantum and Enernet will both be signatory parties to the 
contract (if this is okay...however, who do we send the money to?...)
  (2)  Ignore the "Gathering System Financing" section for now

Please call me to discuss any/all aspects of this deal.

Thanks!

 2.4.      Begin the first sentence with "Except for the express duty

I forgot one item re: Coleman.  Coleman has a few wells that will be flowing 
thru a 3rd party gathering system into Fort Union.  As part of this bigger 
deal with Coleman, we are going to add this receipt point (Exhibit C of 
services agreement) / delivery point (Exhibit C of purchase agreement) to 
these contracts.

The gathering services fee for this point only will be $0.145 per mcf 
(essentially the Fort Union fee).  The marketing provisions would stay the 
same under the gas purchase agreement.

I will get you the meter # and other details, but for now would you call it 
the "Bear Paw / Fort Union interconnect" and reflect the $0.145 per mcf rate.

Dan--

While you were out of the office, Wellstar called with some (last minute) 
changes; all were relatively minor.  I took the liberty of redlining their 
proposed changes for your review and revision.  Let's discuss the attached 
docs, (if necessary), then I'll send Wellstar final copies upon your approval.

Thanks!

Dan

P.S.  I have changes to discuss from Coleman and Yates...(a lot from Yates)

Dan-

This attachment reflects the initial comments by Coleman's Attorney back in 
September.  Due to the substantial revisions, we did not pursue utilizing any 
of their changes, but instead asked them specify their primary points of 
contention.  Although it took four months, I believe the fax refers to our 
request.

Let's discuss.

Thanks.

 Attached are the following documents:

 (1) re-draft of Gas Purchase Agreement with comments in bold,

 (2) re-draft of Gas Purchase Agreement without comments in bold
(i.e., the same as item (1), but without the bold),

 (3) black-lined copy of the Gas Purchase Agreement showing the
revisions made to Enron's initial draft relative to the re-redraft
without comments in bold (i.e., Enron's initial draft as compared to
item (2)),

 (4) re-draft of the Gathering Services Agreement, with comments
in bold,

 (5) re-draft of Gathering Services Agreement without comments in
bold (i.e., the same as item (4), but without the bold), and

 (6) black-lined copy of the Gathering Services Agreement showing
the revisions made to Enron's initial draft relative to the re-redraft
without comments in bold (i.e., Enron's initial draft as compared to
item (5)).

 With respect to the Gathering Services Agreement noted in item
(4), it incorporates revisions made subsequent to the draft that I
e-mailed to you on September 13.  For the most part the revisions are
too minor to be worthy of flagging to you.  The more substantive
revisions are as follows: (A) Section 5.1 was revised to match Section
9.1 of the Gas Purchase Agreement, (B) in Exhibit A, the Fort Union
In-Service Date was revised to reflect the fact that it has already
occurred, (C) in Exhibit A, Section L.1(i)., the reference to third
party, and the related text, was deleted; and (D) in Exhibit A, Sections
M.2, N.9, and N.10 were added.

 With further regard to the Gathering Services Agreement, please
let me know if you want to use the measurement provisions that I
e-mailed to you on September 13, or just use the provisions included in
Enron's draft of the Agreement.

 As I mentioned to you, these agreements still require some work,
but they should at least advance the process and give you something to
discuss with Enron next week.

 As I also mentioned to you, due to fairly extensive rearranging
of the provisions of the agreements, the black-lined versions may not be
easy to follow.

Dan,

The breakout of $0.20 for field gathering, $0.15 for compression plus actual 
fuel and shrink, and $0.15 for Ft. Union gathering works for me.

The last line of Section 2.1 is a problem. We cannnot guarantee a Feb 15. 
date. I would like to put that we will endeavor to install the facilities as 
quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron
. 
Section 4.2 - I don't agree with 90 days......I would settle on 45 days.

In the General Terms and Conditions definitions we need to leave dehydrator 
fuel and dehydrating terms in under Equivalent Quantities and Gathering.
Under Quality the 6% by volume of total inerts must stay.

Let me know what you have a problem with.

Thanks,
Mike

Dan,

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Yates recently agreed (verbally to Brian) to the terms of the attached 
sheet.  I do not know if or when they will sign an LOU; however, as we've 
been doing with other customers in the interest of time, we would like to get 
Yates a first draft of purchase and gathering documents as soon as possible.  
Please call with any questions.  Thanks.

Dan




P.S.  F.Y.I., As you will see in this term sheet, Yates is installing their 
own first stage of compression (screw) and wellhead gathering, similar to 
Ind. Production.

Dan and Dan,
The Colton group (John Anderson, Don Colton, Gregg Colton and Mike
Pinnell)owns 15% of the Bonepile lease through North American Petroleum, LC
(NAPLC).  The four individuals executed the JOA and participated in all
wells drilled thus far in their individual capacities.  However, title to
the underlying leasehold ownership is technically still in the name of North
American Petroleum, LC.  EOW has received specific authority from NAPLC in
the form of a Seller's Representative Agreement to enter into the Enron GPA,
GSA and the WHGGS Mortgage.

EOW will either need to execute all agreements as Seller's Rep for NAPLC or
EOW can execute a ratification of all agreements on behalf of NAPLC, its up
to Dan.

Doug

Subordination Agreement shortly, but wanted to ask one
question in the meantime--is the legal description set forth in
the Subordination Agreement the correct legal description for
the property--I wanted to give further information to the title
company in undertaking their search of the records.  Let me
know.  Thanks.

Dan / Shonnie:

Please review the attached turn of the Coleman documents.  As you will see, 
their attorney (Howard Hartzburg of Jones & Keller in Denver) made numerous 
stylistic changes and some substantive changes.

I have discussed a few of the substantive changes with Coleman and told them 
that, at this late stage, stylistic changes will slow us down.  Of course, 
they responded that their changes "just helped the contract to be easier to 
read".

Let me know your thoughts. 

Thanks.

Dan,

Delete the other e-mail I sent and use this one.

This is the latest and greatest. I changed Gatherer to Provider and Gathering 
Service to Field Services.

I deleted the last sentence in Section 5 - Pressures.  Let me know if this is 
a problem. This line was added to other agreements at the request of those 
parties.




Hope you had a GREAT weekend.

Dan,  The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in 
the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a 
credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.  I have a form of mortgage 
agreement which works with this type of deal.  I would guess credit needs to 
make that call.  Let me know if you want the form.

Dan,
This a.m., BancFirst (the Enernet mortgage holder referenced below) has
agreed to execute a
subordination agreement in favor of Enron.  This can be completed quickly.
I will forward
the executed subordination agreement to you asap.

Now that the BancFirst mortgage is no longer an issue, we need to get all
agreements signed.
Once I get the subordination to you, when can we get final agreement drafts
to review?

A review of the county records should have taken about 1/2 of a day.  What's
status of this review
of the county records?

Doug

Bob--

First, the air permits finally went to public comment on Feb. 14th (we have
received actual copies from the DEQ confirming this); with any luck, we'll
have air permits issued by the 3rd week of March.

In order to proceed with our deal, Enron would like to request that Enernet
work out a deal with their current mortgage holder wherein Enron would not
be subordinate to the current lender.  Although I've copied Doug on this
e-mail, I hope to speak with him verbally to find out if this can be
completed quickly.  I realize that you need to be constructing your
gathering system, so we all need to get this deal finalized.   I assure you
that I am pushing Houston from my end.  In this regard, I do not know yet
if any additional info will be required from Quantum.  I told Houston that
I need to know by tomorrow.

Please pass on to Paul the air permit info.

Thanks.

Mr. Hyvl,

How the heck are you ???
Thanks for the quick turnaround on the Westport contracts.
I am hoping Bierbach will sign them this week and I will get one of the 
originals back to you ASAP and get the other original to Westport.


I need a draft copy of the latest gathering agreement and purchase agreement 
so that True Oil Company can start to review them.
We do not have a deal done with them YET but they would like to start 
reviewing the contracts.

Let me know if this is a problem!

Mike

They won't go away.
Westport feels that they need the agreement amended.
Therefore, I have prepared the attached for your review.

Let me know what you think.

Dan,

The agreement you sent me was not the final agreement signed by Westport. The 
one they signed - see attached - was a Field Services agreement, not a 
Gathering Services agreement.

I made the changes to the attached in Section 4.1. 
Let me know if you are ok with them.

Do we need to have the whole agreement signed or can the one page just be 
changed ?

Mike

Dan,

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Dan -- Attached is a redlined and clean version of the form subordination
agreement regarding Enernet which you sent to me.  I have made some
suggestions, several of which deal with beefing up the consideration for
the subordination for enforceability purposes.  The form of
acknowledgment that you forwarded to me is fine, as long as the
subordination agreement is signed (and the acknowledgment taken)
outside of the State of Wyoming.

Please call with any questions or comments.

For your review and suggestions.....

F.Y.I., there are two partners in this lease --  Enernet and Quantum.  
Enernet operates the wells, but the parties have not worked out a JOA yet, so 
each party wants a term sheet.  I guess I'll send them both the same terms, 
however I'll need to indicate that the MDQ is for 100% of the lease and 
therefore, each party will only get their % of the MDQ based on their 
ownership.   Actually, after typing all this, I hope they do a JOA and we 
contract with only one party.  

Sorry to waste e-mail space.....Thanks.

My mistake....I told Coleman that the Notice of Contract in Exhibit E was

Subject: Petrogulf

Sorry, I forgot one last point that Bill Whitaker (Petrogulf) mentioned to me 
last nite.  Bear Paw is gathering +/-4,000 mcf/d from Petrogulf's wellhead 
into Fort Union.  Since Bear Paw does not buy gas nor has capacity on Ft. 
Union, Petrogulf would like us to include this gas under the MDQ and purchase 
(or gather) this volume under these agreements.  I guess we could just 
identify this receipt point separately on an exhibit and attach a lower 
gathering fee (i.e. $0.145/mcf to cover Ft. Union capacity).  

I hope this made sense.....Thx.

Attached is a draft term sheet for Petrogulf.  Bill Whitaker has not seen 
this letter yet, however it reflects verbal discussions we have had regarding 
terms of a potential deal.  In the interest of time and to be proactive, I 
would like to send Petrogulf a draft contract with these terms included ASAP 
for their review.  This acreage is adjacent to MTG, so its very competitive.  
Additionally, Petrogulf plans to have +/-100 wells drilled by year-end, so 
could be a lot of early gas coming our way!

Thanks.

Dan

Dan,

Here is the scope of the deal with Citizens Utilities, there are a couple of 
things we will have to mention in the contract that are not addressed in this 
letter:
1)  That all load balancing will be handled by injection and withdrawal from 
storage, and that these incremental costs (i.e. variable charges) will be 
paid 
      by Citizens.
2.)  I need to work out a predetermined load profile with Citizens, and that 
profile will need to be in the contract.  This load profile will be used as a 
guide
       and the contract language will need to be able to accommodate 
nomination changes on a daily basis, at our discretion.

I'm sure you will need further explanation, so feel to call me.  Thanks again 
for all you help.
