Mary and I are recommending the following communication outline.  Most of this is a reiteration of what we've been saying for a while, but it is imperative that we do something now.  Radio silence is damaging where employees are concerned.  We're ready to put this into action and waiting for the green light.  Your thoughts, please.

NOVEMBER 12, 2001
BUSINESS WEEK 
FINANCE
By Mike McNamee


Commentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC


For Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's
investigation into Enron Corp. (ENE ) could hardly have come at a worse
time. The future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities
regulation could depend on how well he handles this case.

Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create
real risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer,
and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's
campaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He
has made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by
rewarding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will
still come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs
of let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.

Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where
most cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed
fines--often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being
tough or lenient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the
Enron case is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the
SEC as any other, less connected company.

For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in
Washington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to
shareholders the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the
company's former chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his
fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they
insist Pitt hasn't heard from the White House or Enron's other political
allies.

TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush,
an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm,
top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its
lobbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year
it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies
heavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric
utilities outspend it 35 to 1.

On Oct. 31, a special committee of Enron's board hired William R. McLucas,
former SEC enforcement director, to represent it. McLucas should know that
any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt, who joined
the SEC out of law school in 1968, "remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC
tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco,"
says an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let
its connections sway his judgment.

              Maria Bartiromo reporting:

              I'm also watching Enron.  Enron continues to trade down.
              There are so many rumors going around that--about that
              company right now, which I will not pass on to add to the
              confusion.  But it has been a tough situation for Enron.
              The stock this week down fifty percent.  And there's talk
              we could see another executive resignation.  (Graphic:
              Enron Corp (ENE) one year stock chart)  Already we have
              heard about the CFO being replaced and, of course, Jeff
              Skilling, the former CEO, leaving earlier in the year,
              which really went from bad to worse with regard to the
              situation of Enron shares.

Gentlemen--We had agreed recently that we would get together with Steve to discuss our crisis management and crisis communication efforts.  I am starting to get my ducks in a row and thought we should move this along.  I have asked Stacy to set up this meeting when everyone can make it.

I talked briefly with Steve today about what he expects from each of us, and have written the attached in an effort to delineate the major items.

--Do you agree with all of these?
--What major items have I forgotten?
--What are your suggestions on timeline?

As you will see, many of the items mesh closely, so we should combine our two elements in one document when it calls for a policy or something.  

Feel free to comment before our meeting and I can revise this, or we can just discuss it when we get together.  Thanks.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

ONCE-MIGHTY ENRON STRAINS UNDER SCRUTINY.
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
New York Times News Service
c. 2001 New York Times Company

(For release Sunday, Oct. 28) 
Is time running out for Enron?
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corp., the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring. 
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. 
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said - especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. 
"We are on the side of angels," Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. "People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way." 
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. 
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. 
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. 
Enron, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper Friday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by using all of its lines of credit. 
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company would retain more than $1 billion in cash. 
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, due to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. 
The company declined to make senior executives, including Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Skilling could not be reached. 
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. 
The slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. 
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. 
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. 
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. 
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. 
"You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?" Verleger said. "It's got everyone scared." 
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. 
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. 
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. 
"The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit," said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. 
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corp. and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 
"They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down," he said. 
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. 
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. 
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. 
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. 
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. 
Deals with partnerships formed by Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. 
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. 
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. 
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. 
Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - Skilling and Fastow - have both left the company. 
In an interview in late August, Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, "You're getting way over my head." 
Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the SEC investigation. "There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them," Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. 
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. "If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets," he wrote in a research note after the call. 
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. 
"We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - and we're working on that," Lay said in a statement. "But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron." 
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. 
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets - including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. 
"As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down," Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to "sell" from "neutral." 
"The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts," Coale said. 
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. 
"The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable," said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. "The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable." 
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, "Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?" Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. 
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. 
"With these guys, they tell us - and all you've got is their word - that they're hedged," said Verleger, the economist. 
In fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. 
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. 
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates - and ability to deliver enough electricity - were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. 
Beginning in the 1980s, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. 
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as "security brokers, dealers and flotation." Before, it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products." 
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Fastow's involvement. 
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. 
Enron Will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. 
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. 
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides / Company says cash will boost confidence

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 
Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.
Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short- term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 
Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 
"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 
"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin said. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management." 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 
"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wrote in a report Friday. "Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off." 
Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 
For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 
Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

Enron says Microsoft breached contract
Staff

(Copyright 2001)

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in Houston this week, claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high-speed Internet service. 
The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would provide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband service. Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas.
Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. 
On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's first phase. 
The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but the 14 states served by Qwest. 
Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was "confident that we have upheld our agreement with Enron."

In order to ensure that our communications with the investment community are consistent, Stephen Moore of Moody's and I have agreed to publicly state the following as it pertains to the Moody's rating action taken today:

Full Review To Occur - The action is intended to be the catalyst for a full review of our business operations to occur in the coming months.  The company's appropriate rating will be determined during this time frame;

Primary Areas of Concern - Moody's will be focusing on the following items during the review:

Potential Future Equity Write downs:
Dhabol
California
Broadband Fiber Network
Wessex/Azurix

Slow Progress in Asset Sales - we have been discussing sales for the past 18 months with limited closings

Material Working Capital/Margin Expansion - has resulting in negative cash flow from operations

The Equity Adjustment - Moody's was unaware of the potential of an equity adjustment of this magnitude

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of the points in detail.

Regards:
Tim DeSpain

Matt Quayle
Senior Producer
Squawk Box
CNBC TV

Dear Matt:

If you read the transcripts from this morning, I think you will see how we would not be out of line in recommending that James Cramer's status as a CNBC guest anchor be questioned.

Shooting from the hip about non-existent Justice Department investigations and unfounded allegations and then, when questioned, defending himself by affirming repeatedly "I am not on thin ice here" is absolutely inconsistent with his role on the show.

The business fundamentals at Enron are sound.  Our earnings guidance has not changed.  At the same time, we recognize that our investor confidence has dropped due to issues involving related transactions.  We in no way object to your candid and professional coverage of this.  We do, however, object to a portfolio manager (with positions in the energy sector) who has been put in a journalistic position "going off" on our company with no facts.  It is inappropriate, if not libelous.  We were, at least, grateful that the CNBC people on the set stopped his wild conjecturing.

We consider CNBC to be the gold standard for broadcast business journalism.  Today's performance by James Cramer was bottom of the barrel - the worst I've seen.  Later in the show, James says, "I'm all fired up."  We think "fired" would be appropriate.

Thanks for hearing me out on this.

Mark Palmer



Vice President, Corporate Communications

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

10/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."

BARRON'S: REVIEW & PREVIEW

Turning Up the Heat: 

Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence. Enron shares have plunged 50% recently, after it announced the probe and reported a $618 million loss. 



BARRON'S: The Trader

Bulls Look To Recovery, As Techs Lead The Surge 
By Andrew Barry 


-- In what undoubtedly will become a business-school case study, Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a full-blown financial crisis last week. 

Enron's stock plunged 10.60 to 15.45, following a 10-point drop in the prior week, and the company's bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around 10%. By week's end, Enron had drawn down $3 billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly $2 billion in maturing commercial paper, leaving it only about $1 billion of net liquidity. 

Enron's big energy trading operation, which accounts for the bulk of the company's profits and most of its equity valuation, now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties. Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies, but the company is likely to remain an investment-grade credit. Moody's Investors Service now rates its debt Baa1, three notches above junk. 

One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades, concerned about Enron's viability, push for settlement of the trades, precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 

Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation, Enron has resisted, refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enron-created partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. 

Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air, but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership, leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly $1 billion loss on that deal. 

Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the company's credit ratings. There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets, including its money-losing broadband business. 

Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its second-quarter book value of $13 a share, but it's worth noting that tangible book, excluding goodwill, was only $9 a share. Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enron's $1 billion asset writedown and its still-mysterious $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships. The third-quarter book value won't be known until Enron releases its balance sheet, which may not occur until its quarterly 10-Q is released. 

The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research. The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth. Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didn't demand it. The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the company's leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts' confidence in management. The Street really didn't provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a $75 billion valuation. That value has since shrunk to $14 billion. 

Enron's woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets. Until last week, Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enron's financial health. 

Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 

Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.

Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 

Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community." 

The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 

Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 

Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed investments".

ENRON STOCK SINKS TO 5-YEAR LOW 

Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its stocks hammered by a potential credit crunch and its chief financial officer's ouster, fell to its lowest close in more than five years on Friday. The fall was sparked by word of a big quarterly loss and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the ousted CFO's links to some of Enron's partnerships. Enron stock closed at $15.50, off 85 cents or 5.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Taps Credit Line; Stock Slides

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 

Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

In drawing down the $3.3 billion line of revolving credit this week, the company put about $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper. 

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 

Investors in commercial paper -- who are actually more like lenders, since it's actually a form of debt -- are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of short-term investments. 

The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit. 

"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin said. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management." 

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 

"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wrote in a report Friday. "Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off." 

Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 

For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 

Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. 

"Frankly, that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity," Feygin said. "Until now, everything that's come out I've at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the company's filings or discussions. This is something I had never heard of before."

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 

An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.

The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 

The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 

Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 

Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 

The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

Enron Decline Continues

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 

The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 

"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People are questioning the credibility of management." 

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 

Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 

Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital."

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading giant, continued to pay the price for financial opacity as its stock slumped to its lowest level since 1995 and its five-year bonds traded at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Page 10.

MOODY'S PLACES ALL LONG TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF ENRON CORP ON REVIEW FOR
DOWNGRADE; SENIOR UNSECURED AT Baa1

Approximately $ 13 Billion of Debt Securities Affected.


New York, October 29, 2001 -- Moody's Investors Service placed all the
long term debt obligations of Enron on review for downgrade following the
announcement by Enron of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting
substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. These
actions affect Enron's broadband operations, its merchant portfolio and
the Azurix water company holdings. The company's Prime-2 rating for
commercial paper is confirmed.

Moody's has previously commented on the challenges impacting a number of
Enron's businesses but the magnitude of the announced charges will reduce
Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat
over 50.0% while slashing earnings. The company's previously announced
sale of Portland General, however, will result in cash proceeds
approximating $1.8 billion which management is earmarking for debt
reduction. In addition, the sale will remove approximately $1 billion of
debt obligations from Enron's balance sheet. Moody's notes that, while
this transaction will go a long way to help restore Enron's balance
sheet, it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year
to complete.

In its review, Moody's will focus on Enron's strategic direction and in
particular on the earnings and cash flow outlook for its core gas and
power wholesale businesses. We will also review management's progress in
dealing with problem areas such as its exposure to the California energy
markets and its Dhabol project in India. In addition, Moody's will
analyze further restructuring efforts and the potential for further asset
write-downs as well as for future asset sales that can generate cash for
debt reduction.

Debt securities under review include:

Guaranteed Senior NotesA3

Senior UnsecuredBaa1

Senior Secured or Conv./Exch. Sr. Sec. Shelf(P)A3 / (P)Baa1 / (P)Baa3

Senior SubordinatedBaa2

Also impacted by the review will be the following issues:

Osprey Trust (I & II)Baa2

Enron is one of the world's largest energy companies with approximately
$63.4 billion in energy assets. The company produces electricity and
transports natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy
facilities, and markets and delivers physical commodities and financial
and risk management services. It is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

The Enron Debacle
Byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit's credibility

Executives at high-flying Enron Corp. (ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =
with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=
s year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect=
 documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=
hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=
ll to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an "ass----." Stil=
l, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=
h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=
nvestments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general man=
ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their=
 investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=
vestors seemed overwhelming. "Internally, everybody said this is not a good=
 idea," says a source close to the company.

But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation'=
s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron reve=
aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=
ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the c=
ompany's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=
estigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =
disclosed them to investors.

Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy=
 trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investo=
rs Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meet=
ing with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is wor=
king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=
s, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up=
 a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=
sts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=
se confidence that it can honor its trades.

"ON CRACK?" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still=
 puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=
y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controve=
rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials=
 of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=
se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, =
soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with ano=
ther 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was "on crac=
k." Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 199=
7. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was=
 talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =
ever. "Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=
lames. This is just awful," says one friend.

On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=
s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron =
claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=
llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partne=
rships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and ene=
rgy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =
thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the compa=
ny, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing=
 it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=
mself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversi=
al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=
king comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that th=
e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and e=
xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=
on agrees: "We had the best lawyers in the world saying, `It looks fine."'

But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problem=
s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =
1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, w=
hen Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, compl=
aints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=
ips. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further=
 by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=
ss release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. "=
We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=
l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =
conference call," says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.

BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=
e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=
kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's =
revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=
nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's ag=
gressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with=
 impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the compa=
ny's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=
nty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't pa=
ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business=
 for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom=
 industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=
zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.

These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=
t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. =
"I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=
redibility of the management team," says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the=
 Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.

It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has=
 used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=
rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk =
in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whit=
ewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to =
get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, fre=
eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=
dband (table).

To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=
hese deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough =
to cover debt. Such "mandatory equity" deals have been used by at least a h=
alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (E=
PG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A. Shipma=
n. "Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below boa=
rd" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=
siness.

Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook fo=
r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting =
its shares by more than 25% at today's prices. Analyst John E. Olson at San=
ders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even =
if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron's balance sheet now, the =
debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June.=
 Such a change would pressure Enron's credit rating but not push it below i=
nvestment grade, says Shipman.

HUGE HIT. Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of anim=
al, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=
nd other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=
JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=
atility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and t=
elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to =
consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2=
 billion hit to equity.

But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with=
 the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly succe=
ssful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to =
weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore=
 up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =
trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =
massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, ri=
val traders are wary. "We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=
e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we'=
re still doing business with the company as usual," says Keith G. Stamm, CE=
O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )

"SPEEDING TRAIN." Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=
ering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the un=
certainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron de=
bt. "No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of surv=
ival," says a credit-derivatives salesperson. "It's really difficult to get=
 in front of a speeding train."

Even if Lay can calm his trading partners, he and his management team face =
a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the=
 stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August, 2000--so=
me even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE C=
apital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would En=
ron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possi=
ble mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell, amo=
ng others. "If they're really worried about liquidity, they might take the =
easy way out," he says.

If Enron does pull through this crisis, some suspect it will be a humbler, =
more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its =
trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising=
 space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That's=
 something some investors applaud. "The company should focus on its strengt=
hs," says William N. Adams, senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capita=
l Management, a major shareholder. But that's a far less exciting place tha=
n Enron's energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.=20

Derivatives Danger?
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757081.htm
Lately, owners of Enron's (ENE) equity, bonds, and loans have been struggli=
ng to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they di=
dn't know about before. Now, as a fuller picture of Enron's entanglements w=
ith partnerships begins to emerge, investors have something else to worry a=
bout: credit default swaps, known as CDSs for short.

That's financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their o=
wners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they h=
ave if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about =
two years, but it's growing fast. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others est=
imate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.=
5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly, big banks with hefty balance shee=
ts such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  ), Merrill Lynch (MER ), and Deutsche Ba=
nk (DB ) dominate the market.

Enron, however, is a player--and the only significant one that isn't also a=
 bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 mil=
lion and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year, it had ambitious plan=
s to offer them online. "They don't belong in this market," says one trader=
. "They don't understand the implications." Enron did not return calls seek=
ing comment.

Of course, neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans a=
nd bonds they're insuring turn bad. Trouble is, this year is potentially a =
doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a recor=
d of $100 billion, says Standard & Poor's, like BusinessWeek a unit of The =
McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 bi=
llion by early October.

If Enron has insured any of the bad debt, it might have to take charges for=
 losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has =
been happening in recent weeks, that's the last thing it needs.=20

Commentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC=20
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757082.htm
For Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's inv=
estigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. T=
he future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation co=
uld depend on how well he handles this case.

Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create r=
eal risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer, =
and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's ca=
mpaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He h=
as made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by rew=
arding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will st=
ill come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs o=
f let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.

Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where m=
ost cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed fines--oft=
en make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or len=
ient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case =
is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as an=
y other, less connected company.

For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Wa=
shington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders=
 the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former=
 chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissio=
ners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn'=

TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush=
, an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gra=
mm, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its l=

it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies h=

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Minor changes included....

There was no recognizable change in the number of counterparties.  While we do not identify our counterparties, no one significant has dropped off.  Our transaction volume remains within the normal range, given normal daily and counterparty variability.  The 30-day rolling average for EnronOnline is more than 5,500 transactions with a notional value of more than $2.7 billion.  

While trading volumes in our core natural gas and power business have held steady, as reported in the 10Q, there has been some decrease in wholesale trading volumes in a few of our non-core businesses.  Additionally, due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we have seen some decrease in the number of long-term transactions.  However, long-term deals are often completed off-line and do not appear in EnronOnline numbers).

Editorial Desk; Section A
The Rise and Fall of Enron

11/02/2001
The New York Times
Page 24, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Earlier this year, most companies would have loved to have Enron's problems. Californians resented the energy trading company's huge profits during their energy crisis, and Democrats in Washington raised questions about Enron's influence within the White House and about the cozy relationship between Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Nobody seemed better positioned to thrive during the Bush presidency than this Houston-based apostle of deregulation. 
Wall Street was impressed with Enron's strategy of swooping into formerly regulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas, electricity or unused telecom bandwidth. The company was celebrated as a paragon of American ingenuity, a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high-tech clearinghouse in an ever-expanding roster of markets. Enron's push to force utilities into the Internet age with its online trading systems, at a seemingly handsome profit, became an epic tale of the dot-com revolution.
It now appears that Enron's tale may be more cautionary than epic. Enron envy has crashed, along with the company's stock price, as serious questions emerge about its bookkeeping. Enron disclosed earlier this month that $1.2 billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Most alarming was Enron's reluctance to shed light on management's wheeling and dealing. ''Related-party transactions,'' as the accountants call them, are fraught with conflicts of interest. Though much remains to be learned about these transactions, their scope and lack of transparency suggest that Enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading. The extent to which company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear. 
Enron has scrambled to dampen Wall Street's concerns, acknowledging its credibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses. On Wednesday it brought in William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, to review the transactions. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched its own formal investigation. Mr. Fastow was forced to resign, following Jeffrey Skilling, the man credited with driving Enron into new cutting-edge businesses, out the door. 
Enron's former admirers on Wall Street, mindful of recent scandals involving high-profile companies doctoring their earnings, and of the spectacular collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, are alarmed. Carole Coale of Prudential Securities summed up the prevailing sentiment when she told The Times: ''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose facts.'' Analysts, as well as the media, are not entirely blameless. Enron did mention, albeit in passing, the troubling related-party deals as early as March 2000. But few analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company's revenues, profits and stock price were soaring. 
Harvey Pitt, the new Securities and Exchange Commissioner, must pursue the Enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as vigilant as his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, when it comes to protecting the integrity of financial markets. Indeed, even if Enron is cleared of any wrongdoing and regains some of its past luster, as it well might, the company that preaches the merits of self-regulating marketplaces has reminded us all of the need for a strong regulator on Wall Street.

I am putting together a comprehensive contact list, but in the interim I wa=

and spent time with the CEO of S&P.  I know him through Michael Lewan, one =
of our DC consultants.  You may know of that S&P is owned by McGraw Hill.  =
Michael Lewan gave the "Steve Kean" (and #3) of McGraw Hill his very first =
job in life.  Glenn then introduced me to the CEO of S&P, Leo O'Neill.  Leo=
 is a very approachable person who readily made acquaintances with me b/c o=
f his great fondness for Bob Rubin and Michael Lewan.  Leo told me several =
stories of how he always "thinks better of" the CEOs who sit down with him =
and engage in honest conversation when S&P is evaluating its ratings of a c=
ompany.  That is how Leo got to know Bob; Leo was very impressed with how B=
ob acted when S&P was contemplating action against Goldman Sachs many years=
 ago.  Second, the recently resigned Head of Enforcement of the SEC is a fr=
iend from my gym.  For several years I spent most mornings with him as we s=
hared the same personal trainer.  I am sure Richard hired most if not all o=
f the current SEC enforcement staff.  I am not sure where Richard landed up=
on his departure, as he wanted to just take time off before starting his ne=
xt career.  These two contacts are small, but thought you might want to inc=
lude them in your thinking.  Hope all is well.

Rick,
As the press seems to be turning worse, I would strongly advise Enron to call George Sard of Citigate Sard Verbinnen at (212) 687-8080.  George is probably the leading crisis communications advisor in the world and could offer them great counsel, especially in distributing and managing the current press release.  We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation.
Hope that's helpful.
Kristin

Thanks Eric -- 

Everyone, Steve wanted to be sure that we had an updated, confirmed affirmative statement with regard to commercial activity.  There have been some recent affirmations by specific counterparties, but we are probably safer staying with broad statements in light of the fluctuating situation.

In our wholesale natural gas and power markets, which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity, our customer base continues to have complete confidence in Enron as the market maker of choice.  Our customers are not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes continue to experience above-normal activity levels for both transactions and notional value.  The 30-day rolling average of daily transactions is at an all-time high of over 5,800 transactions per day with an average notional value of nearly $3 billion.

Steve-

The following are the key Deans and Administrators with whom I work.  There are other relationships at these schools so please let me know what your needs are so I can be of better assistance.

If you would like to make contact with these individuals, I would like to be involved, personally, as these relationships, although business, have been very personally cultivated and any interaction on behalf of Enron will be better served with a personal touch.  As it is, I have been in regular contact with these folks over the recent weeks.

Additionally, given the recent history we have had with these institutions and individuals (first telling them everything is A-OK and a month later telling them recruiting, funding and all relationship activities are indefinitely on hold), I would suggest we proceed cautiously with regard to any requests we make of them. 

Let me know if there is anything else I can do to be of assistance.

There have been 6 small ENW employee meetings over the past week.  I attended each of them and have compiled a set of notes from each meeting.  The meetings have been a cross section of questions from employees, recap of what's going on and concerns from employees.  While we have only been able to meet with slightly over 100 employees, these employees represent a significant cross-section of Net Works and most have a large number of employees under them and were speaking for their employees in their comments.

Four of the meetings were led by Greg Piper, Sally Beck and Mark Pickering.  One of those four included Mark Frevert and the other two were led by Mark Frevert.  The attendees are noted before the recap of each meeting.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.

Eric

Needless to say, I am not taking calls on this subject and am getting hounded by John Edmiston (Dow Jones), Mark Golden (Dow Jones) and Cathy Cash (Power Markets Week).

Today's EnronOnline Numbers are as follows:

	Transactions: 4,398 (down 1,793 from yesterday's 6,191)
	Outside Users Transacting: 899 (down 290 from yesterday's 1,189)
	Counterparties: 241 (down 45 from yesterday's 286)
	Total Products Listed: 1,581 (down 454 from yesterday's 2,035)

All are well below the 30-day rolling average.  Any thoughts on how to spin?

Attached are a few minor comments to the Web Q&A, which I have blacklined.  I am signed-off on the document, but would like Wilmer Cutler to also review the Q&A in the morning.  I will do this first thing.
 
Also, I believe that we should confirm with Eric the bullet regarding Enron's continued trading activity (nothing adverse).  Tomorrow morning should have allowed ample time for the Pipeline financing and S&P downgrade to be digested by our counterparties.
 
Regards,
Robert

Mark --

Here is what Richard is comfortable with...

	"We continue to schedule gas and power deliveries and to the extent that we are able to do so, given current conditions, we will perform on our contracts."

Call or e-mail me your thoughts.

Hi Leslie,
 
As per our conversation, I have attached the graphs and trend data for the "top ten" counterparties. These graphs and data represent the EOL deal counts for each counterparty, by business day, since 9/24 and are based on Activity Reports run from the EOL database.
 
The trends are great, as all of the major financial counterparties are either doing business as usual, or actually increasing their activity with us slightly.
 
I will be in the office by 7AM tomorrow, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

Today's figures are as follows:

	Counterparties		=	302
	# of Users Transacting	=	1,156

This compares to 5,405 on October 2, which was a Tuesday.  All expected counterparties were transacting at normal levels.

FYI -- The following internal statement was sent out this morning to all staff in Europe/Japan/Australia.  We are on standby to prepare any further announcement(s) that may need to be sent out to staff, but at this juncture we do not anticipate any additional updates will be sent out today.  

Alex Parsons is working with Richard Lewis and his team to flesh out an internal Q&A, etc. so that we are prepared for reactive purposes regarding the commercial operations of the plant -- more information to follow on this front as soon as it is available.

Further, the media statement which was distributed to members of the press this morning at 07:45 has been posted on the European website:  www.europe.enron.com

Thanks,
Fiona

TEESSIDE POWER STATION INCIDENT UPDATE

UPDATE 9 AUGUST, 2001

Teesside Power Station remains off line today following the tragic incident yesterday, which claimed the life of a third Enron employee overnight.

Two other members of staff died at the scene and a fourth remains in hospital in a stable condition. 

Our priority is to offer all possible support to the families of these employees and a support team has spent some time with them. Any help and assistance which can be given will continue to be offered over the coming days and weeks.

Steps are being taken to support friends and colleagues throughout the company and Enron's Chief Executive Officer in the United States, Jeff Skilling, has flown to the region to meet with staff today.

Meanwhile, Enron is co-operating fully with all the appropriate authorities - including the Health and Safety Executive - in an attempt to establish what caused the incident.

No decision will be taken for several days regarding future operation of the plant.

More information will be provided as soon as it becomes available.

The Public Relations department is handling all media enquires. Should you receive any enquiries about the incident they should be directed to 0207 783 4004.

=DJ WRAP: Fatal Explosion Rocks Enron Teesside Facility
2001-08-08 14:32 (New York)


  By Geoffrey T. Smith
  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Two people died and another two were seriously injured by
a massive explosion and ensuing fire at Enron Corp's Teesside power station
Wednesday.
  The accident is one of the worst in the U.K.'s electricity sector in recent
memory and the first fatal one in generation for over two years. It will keep
the 1,875 megawatt power station, the world's largest combined-cycle gas
turbine facility, out of action until the U.K.'s Health and Safety Executive
has completed an investigation into the incident.
  "Enron will have to put forward a safety case for us to approve before they
will be able to restart the plant," a spokesman for the Health and Safety
Executive told Dow Jones Newswires. He added that the investigation has begun
but that it is too early to say how long it will last.
  A spokesman for the Cleveland Fire Brigade was unable to confirm television
reports that the explosion which caused the fire, had been traced to
transformers at the plant, which are usually oil-filled. However, he said that
the transformers were "possibly" the source of the explosion.
  The Fire Brigade spokesman confirmed that there were no off-site effects and
that there is no risk of further explosions.
  The Teesside power project is located next to one of the U.K.'s busiest gas
import terminals, which takes up to 10% of gas coming ashore into the U.K..
However, a spokesman for U.K. pipeline operator Transco said that flows through
the terminal had been unaffected.
  "Gas is flowing normally through the terminal," the spokesman confirmed.
  The loss of life adds a tragic dimension to a project which has been a source
both of pride and consternation to Enron in the past. The project is a flagship
combined heat and power facility that achieves extremely high levels of energy
efficiency by feeding power and heat into an adjacent industrial park.
  However, Enron has already in the past had other problems relating to gas
supplies for the plant. In January, the House Of Lords, the U.K.'s highest
legal instance, told Enron to pay $144 million back to the five oil and gas
companies that own and operate the Central Area Transmission System, or CATS, a
pipeline which feeds gas into the north-east of England from a number of North
Sea fields.
  The payment related to witheld payments for gas deliveries that Enron had
contracted to take, largely for use at Teesside.
  Curiously, the accident had little direct effect on either spot or forward
prices in the U.K. power or gas markets, due in part to the fact that low
seasonal demand levels mean that there is plenty of spare capacity to meet the
shortfall in supply.
  Enron said in a statement late Wednesday that "the sympathy and thoughts of
all Enron employees are with the friends and families of the victims."
  An Enron spokesman was due to make a fuller statement in Stockton-on-Tees in
northern England at 1745 GMT. No one else at Enron was immediately able to give
more details regarding the extent of damage to the plant.

Two Killed, Two Hurt in Blast at Enron U.K Plant (Update2)

Two Killed, Two Hurt in Blast at Enron U.K Plant (Update2)

     (Adds no effect expected on U.K. power supply in third
paragraph.)

     London, Aug. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said two workers
died and two others were seriously injured in an explosion and
fire at a power station it operates and partly owns in northeast
England.
     The 1,875-megawatt plant was shut down after the explosion,
and Enron operators couldn't say when generation might resume,
spokeswoman Julie Green said in London. In the U.S., 1,875
megawatts can light almost 1.9 million homes.
     The accident will have ``absolutely no effect'' on U.K. power
supplies, said John Wilkinson, a spokesman for Innogy Plc, which
buys power from the plant in Teesside, 300 miles north of London.
     ``There's quite a bit of overcapacity in the U.K., and there
is not a great demand for power in summer,'' Wilkinson said.
     Two men suffered burns in the blast at the gas-fired plant,
police spokeswoman Michelle Robson said. She didn't give the cause
of the explosion or identify the casualties.
     The plant supplies power to petrochemical businesses on the
Wilton industrial site. Health and safety inspectors joined
police, fire and ambulance workers at the scene, Robson said.
     ``There are no dangers of any further explosions,'' Robson
said.
     The explosion was reported earlier today by Sky News.
     Enron shares fell 78 cents to $42.82 in midafternoon trading.

In case you missed it, here's a transcript from Floyd's appearance this
afternoon on CNNfn.  Also, for what it's worth, our view is that you have
nothing to lose by putting out the word that you've got a 14-day extension
on the $690 million.  It buys a little time if nothing else.

Please let us know what else we can do to help.

===============================

CNNfn-STREET-SWEEP-14
Enron Analysis, CNNfn

    THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL
FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
    CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: Shares of Enron
(Company: Enron Corporation; Ticker: ENE; URL:
http://.www.enron.com/) losing steam again today. The stock closing
down $2.07 at $6 99 cents a share. A nearly 10-year low. Investors
apparently concerned about a potential cash crunch at the embattled
energy firm. Joining us with more on Enron`s troubles is Floyd
Norris, financial editor with ``The New York Times.''
    Welcome to the program.
    FLOYD NORRIS, FINANCIAL EDITOR, ``THE NEW YORK TIMES'': Thank
you.
    ROMANS: This has been a fascinating story and stock to watch
develop. First off, what is the latest that drove this stock down
more than 20 percent again today?
    NORRIS: Well, yesterday, after the close, they filed a report
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as people studied
it overnight, they were quite surprised. And it got worse this
morning. They disclosed that they have $690 million in debt. So
they may have to pay next week if they can`t either come up with
collateral, which will not be easy, or persuade the lenders to
renegotiate. And what was shocking about that wasn`t that the debt
existed, that was known, it was that they had to pay it so quickly.
It turns out, according to what people are telling analysts, that
Dynegy (Company: Dynegy Inc.; Ticker: DYN; URL:
http://www.dynegy.com/), which agreed to buy them only a week or
two ago, didn`t know about this. They had not told them,
apparently, Enron didn`t realize they had this problem.
    ROMANS: OK, wait. There seems to be a lot of things that Wall
Street didn`t know was going on. And every sort of revelation is a
big blow to the stock. Who is watching what`s happening here and
how can there be so many surprises. That`s confusing to a lot of
folks who are following this.
    NORRIS: Well, it`s-the fact Wall Street is surprised isn`t
necessarily surprising, but the fact that Enron seems to have been
surprised is surprising. They`ve had a lot of turnover. It
reinforces the suspicion that Jeff Skilling, the chief executive
officer who quit in mid-year, and perhaps the treasury and chief
financial officer, both of whom were ousted within the last month
as this crisis grew, may have been the only people who really
understood what was going on there; and that makes you wonder what
else might yet come out.
    ROMANS: Well, what about auditors and what about the board
governing this firm. And what about Ken Lay, I mean he is sort of
the statesman of the industry, isn`t he? and he`s running this
company again?
    NORRIS: Well, he`s back running the company. The suspicion is,
and Lay denies it, he says he knows what`s going on, my suspicion
is that he didn`t know the details. He trusted. He understood the
company was overvalued, probably. This is a man who was taking out
hundreds of millions of dollars by selling stock, exercising stock
options and selling stock. But I suspect he didn`t understand all
of the details and now they are coming back to haunt him. The other
thing that is bothering people today is these numbers show the
company is burning through cash at an amazing rate. And Enron has
not really given us a good understanding of why they are burning
through the cash that fast. But it raises questions about whether
the company can continue operating until its supposed to be taken
over by Dynegy by next September. And, of course, the way the stock
is trading, it`s obvious that a lot of people on Wall Street doubt
that deal will go through or at least doubt that it will go through
on the announced terms.
    TRACY EICHLER, UBS PAINEWEBBER: Floyd, my question regarding
shareholder lawsuits. It seems like there`s some validity there.
Any new news on the SEC investigation and the magnitude to those
lawsuits?
    NORRIS: There`s no news on the SEC investigation. There are, of
course, huge shareholder lawsuits. They`re filed against Enron,
they`re filed against the current and former officers of the
company. And they`re filed against Arthur Andersen, which audited
this company. The accounting regulators are already starting to
check in again on Arthur Andersen, which used to be the class of
the accounting business and has had a string of recent
embarrassments.
    ROMANS: All right, Floyd Norris for ``The New York Times,''
thank you so much for joining us .
    NORRIS: Thank you.

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.

Here are the EnronOnline numbers for today as of 3:19 pm.  There has been a drop-off, but it has not been too dramatic.

	Transactions:  4806 (down from 5601)
	Number of Users:  871 (down from 960)
	Counterparties:  229 (down from 256)

The final transaction count will be around 5,000.  I'm still waiting to chat with Louise regarding this information to respond to reporter questions.

Eric

Steve, here is the contact list that you requested.  By NO means is this a complete list, as I was not able to get hold of everyone in our group.  Christie will be back tomorrow and will add/delete/amend accordingly.  Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C, Northwestern, LSU, UT.
 
As an aside, I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and/or communications.  Enron's credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enron's key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they don't already know.
 
Hope this document helps in the interim.
 
Regards,
 
Cindy

The attached press release is the latest draft, which has been approved by Enron and one part of Citigroup.  JPMorgan is still reviewing, as is another part of Citigroup.  The release includes several bracketed phrases and sentences that are still being discussed. 

In the first paragraph, Citigroup wants to use "including due diligence" and delete "final."

In the fifth paragraph, Citigroup wants to use the phrase "in a few days" rather than "shortly."

The quote from JPMorgan may or may not be in the final release.

Once the terms of the agreement are finalized, we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday (6 a.m.).  If you have any comments or changes, please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail.

Thank you.

US Financial Markets

Emergency Site Relocation
The emergency site relocation for firms affected by the WTC bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side. Trading is being relocated largely to New Jersey and Connecticut. There was very significant contingency planning here, and it is being put to good use. The futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems. Bond trading, which will resume in Tokyo tonight (as reported in the press), means that the cash market in the US should start to come back tomorrow.
Forex
The foreign exchange markets have been quiet, as the Fed reportedly stepped in and told people to settle their outstanding issues, but not to initiate new directional positions or large arbitrages.
Insurance
The insurance firms most affected by the crisis are ING Reinsurance and Allianz. These firms may have capital issues from insuring losses related to the crisis - they were overconcentrated in this area.
Transportation/Infrastructure Issues
Telecommunications
Communication issues continue to be the biggest problem. This is the only area where sufficient redundancy was lacking. For example, Citigroup is having problems with e-mail capacity and is cutting back on all non-essential e-mails. This continues to be the chief barrier to resuming operations.
Crude/Products/Refineries
LOOP Terminal now restored to regular operations.
Maritime Traffic
According to Dow Jones, dry bulk shipowners were reluctant to lease out vessels on long-term contracts Wednesday, after terrorist attacks in the U.S. Tuesday brought security issues to the fore

Air Traffic

Midway Airlines announced today that effective immediately it has suspended all future flight operations. Their press release states that "this action is being taken at this time in order to preserve the value available for Midway's interest holders and with the recognition that following the recent terrorist attacks demand for air transportation is expected to decline sharply." 

US-Canada Border  

BC border open but moving very slowly. Delay for trucks at BC truck crossing now up to about 6 hrs. Truckers being sorted into two groups, those with papers and order and those without papers in order.All trucks being checked extensively. Only US residents and those on important business are being let back into the US. 
Rail Traffic
All Canadian Pacfiic Railway (CPR - freight) operations in Canada and the US continuing to operate as normal. All CPR border crossings open and moving as planned.

Politics

Saudi Oil Minister states that Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cooperate to cover any oil supply shortage.

NATO expresses support for US; bolstering likelihood of massive reprisal.

Jim -- 

We would appreciate your blessing on this revised Q&A for the web.  All of the questions previously of most concern to you have been removed.  We have added in a question about related parties and basically put in the broad FASB parameters.  The Q&A enables us to stick in some fashion to the commitment Ken made on the last analyst call while also removing some low-end calls into public relations from people who have no idea what any of this means.

Thanks

Vance Meyer

Attached is the current emergency contact list for the Houston Enron facilities. These are the numbers and contact people that will be used by Security and other Facility Services groups to contact people during an emergency involving one of the facilities in the Houston Area. We depend on the people on the list and the people copied on it's distribution to keep us supplied with current information. Please take a few minutes to review the list and insure that the information concerning your area or department is correct. If changes are needed, please do not make changes to the spread sheet. Forward the changes to me via e-mail, and please reference the line number that needs to be changed.

Your help and cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
Randy

This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  

Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.

Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known.  

Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.  

Jeff Skilling

All,

Further to my earlier email, I thought the following information would be of use to you:

1)  Jeff Skilling and Tim Underdown held a short press briefing at 12.30pm this afternoon -- a transcript from the briefing has been posted on the European website ( www.europe.enron.com ) and a quick, simple note is being circulated to staff in Europe, Japan and Australia advising them how to access the transcript.

2) Paul Lund with Standard & Poors' Infrastructure Financing Ratings division contacted us to advise S&P plan to issue a statement on Teesside Power Finance Limited this afternoon regarding the situation at Teesside power station.  We have run the statement by Richard Lewis and Legal and are requesting two minor changes be made before it is released, but in principle the statement is accurate and we have no issues with it.  See attached amended document: 
 
3) In terms of enquiries that are coming in to us on the commercial viability of the plant, we have agreed with Richard Lewis that we will not enter into any discussions of this nature.  Our focus as a company is on supporting the friends and family of the victims and to cooperate with the investigation into the cause of the explosion -- not to comment on the commercial impact of the plant being off line.

4) Finally, we expect to be in a position to release the names of the four employees tomorrow once they have been formally identified.  We are hoping that the Health and Safety Executive will be able to release, at a minimum, its preliminary findings by early next week at the latest.  More information to follow on both issues. 

Fiona

Market Update:

?	NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX set to open Monday; SEC tests on Sunday indicate that few logistical and technical problems are expected to disrupt trading.
?	NYMEX also set to open Monday from 1000CDT to 1300CDT.  The exchange will be physically accessible by ferry.

Asian/European Markets Overnight

?	Sony Corp., which relies on the U.S. for more than a quarter of its sales, plunged 7.7 percent to 4220 yen. The Nikkei 225 slid 386.80 to 9622.09, its lowest since December 1983, while the broader Topix index lost 3.2 percent to 1001.19, on track for its lowest close since October 1998.  Of shares trading in Japan, 294 stocks reached 52-week lows.  Sony Corp., which relies on the U.S. for more than a quarter of its sales, plunged 7.7 percent to 4220 yen.
?	European equities have recovered after a weak opening.
FOREX
?	The dollar is marginally down against the Yen at 117.13, in spite of the BoJ's intervention. The dollar is down against the Euro at 0.9295, amid concerns US' stock market may fall sharply when markets re-open today.  Markets remain on high alert for coordinated intervention in support of the dollar.

Fed/G7 Activity
?	White House "Working Group on Financial Markets" set to coordinate support for possible market intervention.  Fed will purchase equities from institutional investors in the event of a market panic.
?	Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of Japan officials are trying to accomplish two main tasks: (1) provide a zone of stability through direct liquidity injections, quiet intervention on the currency front and intense discussions with senior banking and trading participants; and (2) conduct monetary policy as appropriate to the economic and market conditions of each country and not in response to the terrorist attacks. Because of the severe impact of Tuesday's events on US economic growth there is pressure from senior officials for an inter-meeting rate cut.
?	VP Cheney warned in a Sunday television interview that the country could "quite possibly" be in both war and recession.

Equity Outlook
?	Analysts expect small "patriotic rally" on Monday opening, driven by liberalized rules for company stock buy-backs, intervention by institutional investors and wealthy private investors, and SEC limits on short-selling.
?	First Data Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. among the firms expected to participate in share buy-back schemes.
?	Airline, insurance, and financial stocks expected to face heavy selling, following losses in those sectors in European trading on Friday.  Some form of government relief for the airline industry is probable.
?	Analysts expect Compaq/HP to be among several mergers that are likely to be delayed or cancelled.

Insurance
?	Swiss Re, Northwestern Mutual, Chubb, and Hartford Financial among leading insurers who have stated that the attacks were not "acts of war" and that payments will have to made.  Payments from the insurance industry are expected to reach $30 billion.

olitical/Security Update:

?	As expected, no overt military action was taken by the US this weekend against Afghanistan or any other target.
?	Expectations continue to center on Afghanistan as the most likely target for military strikes, sometime this week.  Partial mobilization of reserves is bigger now than in early stage of 1990 crisis.
?	A Pakistani delegation will reportedly visit with Taleban leaders to establish a deadline for the handover of bin Laden. 
?	Multinationals were evacuating staff and dependents from Pakistan and other countries in the region.  Japan's Toyota Motor and Honda Motor Co., had begun pulling staff out of South Asia. Japanese trading firms Marubeni Corp., Itochu Corp. and Tomen Corp. are evacuating dependents from Pakistan, while Nichimen Corp. has told its employees' families to leave Pakistan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, BP has evacuated all expatriate staff from Pakistan.
?	The US has secured logistical and political support from both traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere, as well as from less friendly nations such as Iran and Russia.  The coalition could be difficult to hold together as the campaign widens beyond Afghanistan.
?	Strikes against Iraq do not appear to be imminent, but are by no means out of the questions.  Sources report that Iraq has been sheltering elements of the bin Laden network in northern Kurdistan.   US demands that Syria shut down terrorist groups operating on its soil
?	The challenge for the US will be to keep the focus on a "war against terrorism" and not a "war against Muslims", a very difficult line to avoid crossing.  Pope John Paul II, former South African President Mandela, and French Prime Minister Jospin are among those urging the US to show restraint.
A calmer atmosphere now prevails in the Senate. Senators expected the Administration to make those responsible 'pay a price' but were not pressuring the White House to act before it was ready and before it had made a determination of who was responsible. There was no sense, therefore, that Bush was under political pressure to take immediate or premature action. The only caveat was that Senators disliked the idea, being put forward by Attorney General Ashcroft, of bringing the 'guilty parties to justice.'


C.	Infrastructure Updates

Telecommunications

?	Local telephone company Verizon Communications said on Sunday its communications network, damaged in the World Trade Center attacks, passed service tests with the New York Stock Exchange and appeared ready for stocks to resume trading on Monday.

Crude/Products/Shipping

?	Re-insurers are expecting war risk insurance premia would go up by 500%, and these charges were in many cases already in effect. The combination of the Air Lanka airbuses destroyed in the recent Tamil Tiger attack at Colombo airport, and the four aircraft destroyed in the USA this week, implied total losses of around 23 years of premium, according to sources. This was simply the liability for assets and did not include compensation for personal injury or death. Aviation and shipping are closely linked in the application of war risk.  
?	Additional complications are being encountered due to strict rules on inspection, tug requirements and anchorages.  To make matters worse, many of the tugs and barges associated with petroleum traffic have been diverted to support disaster recovery operations.  Sources report that the harbor was completely shut again on Friday during President's visit to New York City.
?	The stricter regulations mean that blending shipments from NY to New England are delayed, and conventional shipments into the NY area are also delayed.  The majors are working to divide product up between themselves in obvious fear of being seen as manufacturing a shortage during a crisis or profiteering at time of a national tragedy. 
?	Helicopter flights to offshore rigs and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) have resumed, albeit under stringent new rules that are reportedly overloading the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), which instituted a no-fly ban after the attacks.
?	Sources report fewer tankers being chartered to US destinations due to higher risk premiums associated with the political situation.  In one case, two shipments of Iraqi Kirkuk from the Mediterranean bound for the US were cancelled after the letters of credit were rejected.  This represents 4 million barrels, whereas the US imports about 63 million barrels per week.  So on the fourth day of the crisis, this factor was expected to have caused a 10-20% drop in crude sailings to the US.  The crucial unknown is the length of the crisis.  If security concerns continue in the weeks ahead, this figure will likely rise.  
?	New York Harbor is open, but operating under strict restrictions.  Ships are being allowed in on a case-by-case basis.  Normal vessel flow of 140 ships a day was only back up to 20 on Saturday.
?	Valdez, Alaska; Seattle, Washington; LA/Long Beach, California all open, but operating under heightened security.
?	Several major refining units in Japan have reopened this week, reassuring local markets amid concerns of an energy supply crisis from the Middle East. The Tonen General refinery at Sekiyu reopened on the 15 September, followed this morning by Idemitsu's Hyogo refinery. The 80,000 bpd Hyogo refinery has been closed since 13 August for routine checks and maintenance. The 335,000 bpd Tonen Sekiyu plant, which is a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, closed a 77,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU) on 1 September, also for routine checks and maintenance.
?	Nippon Mitsubishi Oil has suspended oil exports due to concerns over the possibility of disruption to oil supplies from the Middle East. In August Nippon Mitsubishi exported 818,000 barrels of oil products including kerosene and jet fuel, mostly to other parts of Asia, but also to the US. However it has said that it may be prepared to dip into the country's 20m tonne LPG stockpile if the crisis escalates.  The government has made no official announcement to oil companies to increase stockpiles in the light of last week's terrorist attacks in the US. Other refiners, including Cosmo Oil and Idemitsu Kosan, have announced that they will continue to export their oil products as usual.

LNG

?	River pilots in Lake Charles report that the LNG vessel FINIMA is presently scheduled to arrive at the entrance to the Calcasieu River channel at Lake Charles at 0500 on 9/18, whereupon it will be boarded by a pilot and escorted by at least two tugs run by Seabulk International to the LNG terminal for cargo discharge.
 
Air Transport

?	Washington officials are discussing the conversion of Reagan National Airport from a civilian facility to a military base. The airport remains closed.
?	All major US airlines expecting or have already initiated schedule reductions and lay-offs in expectation of falling demand for air travel.
In Washington's Dulles airport, meanwhile, passengers are being asked to check in four hours before departure. Yesterday saw around 65% of usual flights by American Airlines take off.
British Airways was running 70% of its flights out of Heathrow and 80% from Gatwick.

Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it.

In preparation for this Friday's Bank Meeting, we are in need of a comprehensive Question & Answer List for the Q & A session at the end of our presentation.  If you have such a list right now, could we use that as a basis for ours? Cheryl Lipshutz is spearheading our efforts.

The Bank Meeting is still scheduled for this Friday at the Hyatt, beginning at 8:00 a.m. and all of you are encouraged to attend.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
