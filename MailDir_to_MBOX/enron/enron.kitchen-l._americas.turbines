Brett:

Ron Tapscott and Chris Booth are also moving forward with a US equipment broker, Milt Fyre. Let's work closely on this as we should try to avoid having  a number of brokers working the same buyer. Who can Chris and Ron contact on your side?

Ben

FYI.  It sounds like the developer with whom we are negotiating on the MHI turbines will not be paying us the initial payment today.  We have communicated to him that we will not hold the turbines off the market until he makes a cash payments and we will continue to work with other potential purchasers.  We received a conditional offer from another individual at a price approximately $2 million less than the original offer.  I am going to concurrently move forward on a similar basis with this company and see which one gets there first.  Let me know if anyone wants to approach this differently.

Thanks,
Brett

Let's discuss the whole strategy after this message I just got from Fred.  Let's remember that Fred is worth $2MM more than Davis.

Dear Guillermo,

WE ask that you be patient with us as we are affected by the recent changes
in the State of California.
Where we had an agreement with DWR, the governor. Mr. Davis, cancelled all
LOI contracts issued by DWR as of last Friday, we just learned this today.

However, for us, our IPP, we were given a new LOI this past Monday, good for
a week till next Monday, 27 Aug.,  and, it appeared our agreement was to be
with the new agency, Capa, ( Ca.Power Authority). Now, for our benefit, it
is back with DWR, and we have a PPA, in draft form, our developer is working
on with the State people. They, our dev., has been asked to stay in the
Capital till this is signed off on Monday which they are doing, staying!

I asked if we could get you a copy of this PPA but we can provide you with
the replacement LOI from DWR and we have requested the Draft PPA as well.

The moment the PPA is signed the funds will be wired to ENA, this we have as
a promise from the IPP and the Corporate Funding Group.

We have demonstrated our dilemma  and are doing the best we can.

Keep in mind that our IPP is the only one left to end up with a contract.
Ten others were not extended.

If you can see your way clear please give us until next week to provide the
funds without changing the end date of 28 Sept. Extend us one more week.

Your thoughtful understanding is greatly appreciated. Please feel free to
have Brett give us a call so we can personally bring him up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make our client aware of the need to
produce the funds  we have committed to and they have given us their
assurance that this will indeed be done at the moment of signing.

It's just that the State of Ca. really threw us for a loop with this new
agency and back and forth with DWR, and now we are  back on board as
originally intended.. Just more political posturing.

Best regards,

Fred Lange

Louise:

Apologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning's call.

With respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we're working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows:

1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP.
2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 
3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant.

On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together.

On item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state. I have brought Heather into this deal as well.

On item 3, last week Kevin indicated he has renewed interest in Florida. Duran and I will try to figure out this week exactly what this means.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

See you tomorrow.

Ben

Louise:

Given my dealings with MHI in the past, I think this would be difficult to get at a reasonable level.  That being said, at some level they would agree, but I don't have a good idea of the level.  However, at this point, I don't think we should go in this direction.  I think we should continue to play out the options that we are pursuing and see if they are successful.  Give us a few weeks and then re-assess.

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this?  

How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September?  

As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward.

Louise

Don:

This sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from Michael Kolman (not our Michael Coleman) of Navigant. Was the offering you received from Navigant as well?

FYI, Navigant (again, Michael Kolman) is representing us on the sale of our SW501D5A, and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market.

Regards,

Ben

Dear Guillermo,

WE ask that you be patient with us as we are affected by the recent changes
in the State of California.
Where we had an agreement with DWR, the governor. Mr. Davis, cancelled all
LOI contracts issued by DWR as of last Friday, we just learned this today.

However, for us, our IPP, we were given a new LOI this past Monday, good for
a week till next Monday, 27 Aug.,  and, it appeared our agreement was to be
with the new agency, Capa, ( Ca.Power Authority). Now, for our benefit, it
is back with DWR, and we have a PPA, in draft form, our developer is working
on with the State people. They, our dev., has been asked to stay in the
Capital till this is signed off on Monday which they are doing, staying!

I asked if we could get you a copy of this PPA but we can provide you with
the replacement LOI from DWR and we have requested the Draft PPA as well.

The moment the PPA is signed the funds will be wired to ENA, this we have as
a promise from the IPP and the Corporate Funding Group.

We have demonstrated our dilemma  and are doing the best we can.

Keep in mind that our IPP is the only one left to end up with a contract.
Ten others were not extended.

If you can see your way clear please give us until next week to provide the
funds without changing the end date of 28 Sept. Extend us one more week.

Your thoughtful understanding is greatly appreciated. Please feel free to
have Brett give us a call so we can personally bring him up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make our client aware of the need to
produce the funds  we have committed to and they have given us their
assurance that this will indeed be done at the moment of signing.

It's just that the State of Ca. really threw us for a loop with this new
agency and back and forth with DWR, and now we are  back on board as
originally intended.. Just more political posturing.

Best regards,

Fred Lange

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

FYI on the latest status on the MHIs.  If we don't see some progress tomorrow  from Fred, we are going to need to make a decision on whether to move forward with Genassis.  He had put a deadline of tomorrow for his offer which is approximately $3 million less than Fred Lange.  However, he seems to be willing to move quicker.  I will let you know if we hear anything from Fred.

Subject:	MHI 501F's Sale Process - Status

Brett,

The following is a status summary on where we are regarding the sale of the first 2 MHI 501F turbines:

Our two most firm candidates right now are:

(i) Fred Lange, from Rescue 2000, for a project in California of a company called Intercom:  His offer for the turbines, the already directed change orders and spare parts was US$90,230,000.  He agreed to make a US$200,000 payment for a three-week exclusivity upon execution of the relevant PPA, which is expected for today.  The PPA execution was postponed for a week (from last Monday until today) due to regulatory changes in California.  Therefore, there is no certainty about the PPA being executed today.  We will talk to Fred Lange tomorrow to check where the process is.
 
(ii) Rick Davis, from Genassis, for a project in Mexico, of a company called Empresa Industrial Rio Colorado:  His offer for the turbines, the already directed change orders and spare parts was US$87,000,000.  He made his offer willing to make a US$2 million exclusivity payment, to be refundable "if Enron does not obtain the assignment of the MHI contract".  We will call him tomorrow to inform him it is really up to them to qualify as a Permitted Assignee (they have a copy of the contract with the Permitted Assignee conditions), and will check his position about making the US$2 million payment absolutely non-refundable.

As a back up, we are also talking to a couple of other brokers (Mike Edwards -Belyea Power - and Tom Young - TRY Ventures -), who are running behind the two above mentioned.  

The following table shows (i) the book value of the different turbines components and (ii) the profit Enron would make based on the two offers received so far: 

Base Price						67,817,800
Change Orders		  		  		  6,752,560
Spare Parts		  		  		  4,900,000
Approximate Financing Costs				  2,800,000
Total Book Value					82,270,360

							Fred Lange	Rick Davis
Price Offered						90,230,000	87,000,000
(includes Base Price, Change Orders and Spare parts)		
Book Value						82,270,360	82,270,360
Enron Profit						  7,959,640	  4,729,640

Let me know any doubts or comments you may have.

Thanks, Guille.

Potentially, but we would need to both repermit the site (air, minor site plan modifications, etc.), and have FPL agree to the equipment change without us loosing our position in the interconnect queue. We will do some further investigation and get back to you.

Ben

Louise:

Apologies, but I forgot to mention a couple items on Florida on this morning's call.

With respect to our Florida development book, and the Midway site in particular, we have 4 value propositions that we're working on. We talked about the first one, which relates to the sale of the development asset (with a target gross sales price of $13 million). The others are as follows:

1. Leverage site positions to bid into FPL's recently announced 1,700MW RFP.
2. Leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power. 
3. Leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant.

On item 1, we have been speaking with FPL for some time, and we think we may have a competitive advantage (because of the number and maturity of our development assets) to offer a unit contingent contract to FPL, or simply a sale of one or more sites. If we were awarded a contract, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package (a la LV Cogen). Heather Kroll and I are working on this together.

On item 2, I was contacted by Williams a couple of weeks ago. They indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our Midway site. We have since signed a confidentiality agreement, and are discussing indicative terms. As with item 1, if we negotiated a deal with Williams, we could go in the market, buy turbines, and flip the package. Aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal, as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state. I have brought Heather into this deal as well.

On item 3, last week Kevin indicated he has renewed interest in Florida. Duran and I will try to figure out this week exactly what this means.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

See you tomorrow.

Ben

Louise:

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I'm on vacation this week, and did not pick up my mail until late yesterday afternoon.

Brett and I have been working through our respective groups on finalizing numbers for the Ft. Pierce turbine. I expect that we should have numbers tomorrow. The only issue on this has been to make sure we are properly allocating change orders and spare parts between the two MHI turbines which are presently under one contract. By tomorrow, we expect to have a proposed cost allocation and will then present it to Brett for his review and approval. 

With respect to the second MHI unit, Dave Duran, Ozzie Pagan and I have a call scheduled tomorrow to discuss the Homestead project. On the development side, we will know where we stand with respect to local approvals by mid-May. We are in the process of obtaining permits for a facility of up to two MHI 501Fs. At least to this point, our proposed site has not raised the type of controversy we have experienced in Broward County.

Lastly, I wanted to make sure you knew that we received our final local approvals for our Midway site in St. Lucie County. Greg Krause ( a director in my group) and his team really stepped up to the plate to deliver on this. This project is now one of the only fully permitted merchant peaker projects in Florida.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

As I see it, the information below outlines our current turbine position.  Please could you confirm that the transfer pricing has been completed between North America and South America on the transfer of the Mitsubishi turbine for Fort Pierce, we will be transferring a second turbine across from ESA to ENA for the Homestead project.  

I recognize that there may be a requirement for 2 turbines for Homestead but I assuming that you will come and see me with regard to this before we reallocate further from ESA.

Please complete both transfers this week and let John and I know the numbers at which transfer occurred.

Thanks

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years.

Subject:	An allocated turbine

I think I have found the turbine causing the accounting issues.  It's the Westinghouse 501D5A.  The good news is, is that this from a commercial point of view is being looked after so there are no external issues to worry about - just allocation issues.

I would propose that we notify the accountants of the following:-

ENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward ENA will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.
The nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with 	respect to the turbine. 
The carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME/EGA is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on 	CALME/EGA based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.
The continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.

I think that does it and should clear up the accounting issues and Wes can then deal with sorting out the allocations.

(Wes please sort out unless Jim has any problems with the above methodology).

Thanks

Louise

I'd like to get some time with you tomorrow or Wednesday at your convenience to further discuss Onondaga. We are effectively at a cross roads with respect to monetization activities, and I'd like to get some guidance.

Please let me know if you might have some time.

Also, I hope the site sale information I sent you yesterday for your board presentation met your needs. Please let me know if I need to do any follow up on that, or if you have any questions on the project status information I e-mailed you for today's weekly origination meeting. The meeting Heather and I had with Williams went well, and I can give you an update on that as well.

Louise / Dave:

We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.

Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the "receivable" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.

With your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of Onondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Ben,

Based upon the review of the Cashflow Interest Agreement, Partnership Agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income.  The basis that is carried on our books currently (approx. $7.9 mm) represents a long-term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ENA and OCLP.  In addition, This asset does not qualify for the MTM or Fair Value accounting models.  The payment received from OCLP based on the Cashflow Interest Agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books.

However,  it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce/write-off  $8 million of this long-term receivable based upon the best information available at the time.  As stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been.  This would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible.  This will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year.  This basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as MTM.

A few things need to be noted:

1) Support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset. Please provide this to me 

2) You will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset.  Supposedly Corp took the write down....may cause problems.

3) Somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create.  It is my understanding that RAC and Credit are not involved.

4) We need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year.  We will probably get questioned by AA.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.


Regards,

Billy

Please book the payment received from Onondaga as Q3 income. In this morning's meeting with Louise, I have advised her that our internal valuation and sales efforts support this payment being taken as income.

Please advise as I need to update her tomorrow.

Brett contacted me today by e-mail with some cost detail on the Ft. Pierce unit. I plan to get back to him on Monday, but wanted to know if you have reached a decision on how you would like us to proceed with the MHI turbine book.

To all,

I'm very concerned, as I'm sure you are, about the exposure of holding the Mitsubishi units and the Westinghouse 501D.  With the market for machines getting softer, the opportunity to sell these units looks increasingly slim.

MHI Units:

I recommend that we seriously evaluate developing a project or projects around the MHI units.  To do this, a project may have to underperform financially, but it may be significantly less of a hit than holding the machines for an indefinite time.  When this has been suggested, the resonse is that the economics don't work for this project.   The value of the units is around $160MM and the cost of holding them will only increase.  To avoid a major impact I feel it's important that we consider this issue on a global Enron basis, rather than on a project basis.

One potential opportunity would be to put these some of these units into the mid-west project which Fred Mitro has gotten permitted.  Other potential projects may also be good vehicles.  

W501D5A:

We need to reach closure on this unit.  As a single unit, this unit may be easier to dispose of.  If we can get it out of the legal arena, perhaps we can get Siemens- Westinghouse to take it back for what we paid.  Otherwise, we should go ahead and get it equipped with a generator and either sell it or put it into a project.  As it stands now, the cost of holding it will be going up monthly.  Ron Tapscott is now the lead for addressing this issue.

If the group thinks that the above suggestions have any merit, perhaps we should discuss what has to happen internally to pursue either of these to execution.

Thanks!

Mike

Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market.

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Guys,

Portland General is long a Sep 30 LM6000 Sprint PC.  Their mini-peaker project has died.  They are giving us a first look before they give it to GE to re-market.   Price = $16.8MM +  115kv step-up transformer.   I could see buying 3-4 for QI but I don't have a need for such an early delivery.  East? Brazil?

Subject:	RE: An allocated turbine

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years.

Subject:	An allocated turbine

I think I have found the turbine causing the accounting issues.  It's the Westinghouse 501D5A.  The good news is, is that this from a commercial point of view is being looked after so there are no external issues to worry about - just allocation issues.

I would propose that we notify the accountants of the following:-

ENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward ENA will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.
The nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with 	respect to the turbine. 
The carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME/EGA is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on 	CALME/EGA based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.
The continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.

I think that does it and should clear up the accounting issues and Wes can then deal with sorting out the allocations.

(Wes please sort out unless Jim has any problems with the above methodology).

Thanks

Louise

Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market.

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Steve

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Louise,

We refreshing our turbine purchase agreement to address some transfer liabilities associated with removing the turbines from a third party site.  Other than that, I see no reason that will delay our providing our docs to EOL this week.  In the meantime, we are discussing an auction or offer price format with EOL.

They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

By the way, did you have a discussion with CALME on the carrying costs on the Westinghouse 501D5A?

EEL is now selling its 9FAs (previously mentioned for Arcos), I referred John Sherriff to you to see if you have any potential outlets for these turbines. So in case someone telephones you, that is where the call comes from.

Please keep in mind that as soon as FERC approval is received (which is expected in approx. 30 days), the statement below will no longer be true as the sale of our interest in Doyle to Walton EMC will become effective.

"Enron owns a 50 percent interest in Doyle I, LLC, an approximate 350 MW peaker plant in Walton County, Georgia."

Let me know if you need anything else. See you at our meeting at 10 am tomorrow.

Dear Friends

Naturally the news about Enron has not escaped anyone and I will come back to
his in a while.

But first and foremost I would like to thank you for the great gesture to
receive the ABB delegation late last month. You kept the meeting despite the
turmoil and managed to make the meeting very productive. To me that illustrates
a great company with great people staying together but also staying close to
partner and the business also in difficult times. Our discussions where
productive and for me personally a good illustration of the competence and
knowledge in your organisation.

Back to the recent news I understand that the ownership structure will change
for Enron but we from ABB sincerely hope that the knowledge, spirit and
entrepreneurial spirit that formed Enron will be preserved in the new
organisation. We look forward to opportunities to develop and build projects
together with you for the benefit of both organisations.

If there is anything we can do further to support your business please call Mike
as before and I will make sure he gets the backup needed.

Be Proud and Look Forward to See You Again!

Bo Normark

Louise:

Apologies, but I will not be able to attend or call into tomorrow's meeting. Heather and I are going to Tulsa to meet with Williams to discuss a toll off of Midway and Ft. Pierce. Fred, however, will attend.

I have the following updates on our Q4 deals:

1. AES Haywood - no change in status. Expect to receive final $2 million upside payment in Q4.

2. Doyle - negotiating definitive sale documents with Walton. Expect to sign docs by end of next week. Deal is subject to FERC approval, to be requested upon doc execution. FERC approval is anticipated to take 60 days.

3. Onondaga - have received expressions of interest from two parties (United Capital and Trust Company of the West). Will move toward binding term sheet within next several weeks. Indicative values are $11 million.

4. Midway and Ft. Pierce - have issued investment memorandum to several interested parties, and expext indicative bids in 45 days. Have also bid Midway, Deerfield, and Corbett sites into FPL RFP (short list to be announced late October). Also pursuing potential tolling deals with Williams and Mirant.

5. Georgia - have sent Calpine definitive purchase docs for two sites (Athens and Hartwell). Expect comments back late this week. Will also use sites to bid into Georgia Power RFP due this week.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

The "bid" is for an EPC Contract with the equipment.  The implied bid for the equipment is -$16.7MM.  The implied margin in the EPC Contract is $32MM plus $11MM of contingency.  If the risk/reward on the EPC contract is reasonable, then this seems like a great deal.  At the same time, we will attach a Turbine LOI to the EPC LOI making it clear to Allegheny that we can offer the turbines on a stand alone basis.   Should we offer at the $10MM discount or are you OK with -$16.7MM?  Ben and I would hit a -$16.7MM bid.    This would probably close this in January, but we ould try to get a turbine down payment in December.

I spoke with LeDain in Calgary.  They had a bid for C$3MM w/out the ABB turbines.  They are not planning to pursue because Lavorato commented that it is better to hold onto the site at that price.  The site is permitted for the ABB's.  I have asked LeDain to send me their original info memo for the sale of the site (w/ turbines); it might be worth trying to market that project again - time has passed, the market there may open soon, Ontario just set a new peak and East prices rallied last week.

Can you confirm that we are still talking to the guys in Canada with regard to selling the ABBs with the Moore site.  I only mention this as the 'hotlist' shows that they are planning to sell the site which I am not sure is feasible without combining the turbines.

Thanks

Enron Canada may be close to selling the ABB units for over $35MM.  Please refrain from offering a lower price to brokers, consultants, etc. on these units for a week.  We should still mention them as available and should still work on putting them on EOL (if this party is real, it might be slick to have them close the transaction electronically!).

I think this weekend's Barrons put me over the top.  I'm scared shitless about our turbines.  Can we talk Monday or Tuesday about them.  On the South American ones that we are getting next year.  Can we turn them back for a fee?  We need to be willing to take a big hit and exit this stuff.

We received two financing commitment letters from Hancock.  In general, the letters are good and suggest that Hancock is genuinely in the deal, but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals.  Chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get Hancock to call Ben Glisan to assure us that they are in (Hancock wants a lot of future business from Enron).  In the meantime, we are innovatively stalling GE by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them.  I think we will get both sides of this trade done.

As I didn't see a turbine list attached, just to confirm our conversation, the turbine book to be shared 1/3 by me, Calger, and Wiggs will inlclude the 3 x MHI501Fs, the 1 x 501D5A, and the ABB11Ns coming in from Canada.Please let me know if I've forgotten anything.

I'll get right on this.

Can you three get together and come up with a strategy for all the turbines and let me have some sort of summary document.

I am assuming that you three own the turbine book (33.3% each) and have the following turbines (let me know if I have forgotten any).



I would also like to see the outline of terms under which (i) the transfer of the ABB turbines from Canada and (ii), the terms under which Brett participates in the turbine book.  (You'll need to agree all this by Thursday, I will give you transfer number on Friday for the ABB turbines if one is not included in the report).

You guys need to discuss this together and please get me the information on Thursday (let me know if you want to discuss it or will just email me a copy).

Louise,
We received your note of July 2.  Rather than forcing you into the role of arbitrator at the outset, we decided to try to resolve the turbine transfer issues with Chris Calger first.  Accordingly we had forwarded a proposal to Chris on Friday, and together with Chris we worked out a revised proposal yesterday, incorporating some of the concepts in your note.  Chris will be reviewing the revised proposal with Ben tomorrow to get his input, and Chris planned to touch base with you afterwards.

Louise:

My responses:

1. The carrying costs have been capitalized, and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract.

2. At this time, the turbine value is undetermined. While we have identified one potential counterparty (Montana Power), we do not have a signed deal. In addition, we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse regarding the damaged generator. While we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position, there exists the potential of this going into litigation.

3. Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December, but never got a formal response. I have put in several calls to Elio Tortolero at CALME, but have not heard from him for about a month. He advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal. My group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since December.

4. This unit was initially an ENA unit, but was taken by CALME (David Haug) I believe in December '99 for projects they were considering. I am not aware of the terms of that transfer. 

FYI, I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine.

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Also, I have attached an updated site bank map which includes our Texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous e-mail.

Regards,

Ben

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years.

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Steve

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Louise,

So I can make our Turbine Position Report as accurate as possible, may I join you, Chris, Brett and Ben for the turbine meeting scheduled for later this week?  I also want to better understand some of the issues surrounding the various pieces of equipment so I relay this to Rick Buy prior to the BoD meeting.

Louise:

We are presently working with Jody Pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place, and a turbine report form prepared. We will have this to you in the next 10 business days. The only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for $400k, and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm (Navigant) to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the SW501D5A. Lastly, we are reviewing the possibility of having the Ft. Pierce project use MHI unit #3 instead of unit #1 in light of the apparent market interest in units 1 and 2, and the current Ft. Pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit #3 than unit #1.

Mike Coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor (from a technical perspective) and maintain the 501D5A and the 501Fs.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

Subject:	MHI 501 F Disposition Planning

With the shipment of two of the four units from MHI scheduled for August and no viable place to ship them, our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly.  We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

Sorry I didn't reply last week but I promised myself I wouldn't reply to anyone unless I had had six hours sleep!  

Anyway - how I thought we had left it was that you were going to aproach them on splitting the cost - $1.3m each and that would be it.  Ask them if this is OK - if not let's sort it out next week.

Wes,
This relates to the Calme 501D5A turbine we discussed in your office with Ben Jacoby & Jeff Sommers.  To refresh your memory, Ben has a buyer identified, and is willing to accept the transfer of the costs of $22.9mm from Calme.  However, he does not want to take the carrying costs of $2.6mm Calme has incurred to date.  In the meeting, you said that you would discuss the transfer price with John/Louise.  We are being asked for coding so Global Assets can transfer of the full amount.
 
Please advise,
Jody

Fred Mitro and I just got off the phone with Duncan Croasdale at Enron Canada regarding the 11N1s. He indicated that, although nothing has been signed yet, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.

Duncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada's books for US$38 million, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.

I am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Booth in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending GE7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these units. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them. We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly.

Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.

Regards,

Ben

Discussions are heating up with Montana, and as such we have started to negotiate with Westinghouse a resolution to the generator claim. Please let me know if you have any update on CALME.

We intend to proceed with Montana and Westinghouse and cut the best deal for Enron Corp. Any definitive deal will of course require a DASH and your approval. Please let me know, however, if we need to slow these discussions down until we're fully resolved with CALME.

My responses:

1. The carrying costs have been capitalized, and under the accounting rules will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the turbine contract.

2. At this time, the turbine value is undetermined. While we have identified one potential counterparty (Montana Power), we do not have a signed deal. In addition, we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse regarding the damaged generator. While we hope to resolve this dispute in the context of our exiting the turbine position, there exists the potential of this going into litigation.

3. Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December, but never got a formal response. I have put in several calls to Elio Tortolero at CALME, but have not heard from him for about a month. He advised me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal. My group has had de facto management responsibility for the unit since December.

4. This unit was initially an ENA unit, but was taken by CALME (David Haug) I believe in December '99 for projects they were considering. I am not aware of the terms of that transfer. 

FYI, I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine.

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Also, I have attached an updated site bank map which includes our Texas site which was inadvertently left off the previous e-mail.

Ben

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly related to has been dead for several years.

Progress since your email - We did have a meeting too with the owners of the turbine book (Calger, Jacoby and Wiggs) last Thursday.  Clearly we are pursuing all avenues to sell, mitigate, place as many of the turbines as soon as possible.  I am also suggesting that we look as to whether we could negotiate a cancellation with Mitsubishi. 

Ben can provide you with more detail of where we are with each customer, if you want a copy of what they gave me let me know.  But generally I probably want rid of these turbines more than anyone.

Louise:

We are presently working with Jody Pierce to get the accounting system for the turbine book in place, and a turbine report form prepared. We will have this to you in the next 10 business days. The only recent news is the sale of the steam turbine for $400k, and that we intend to utilize an outside consulting firm (Navigant) to enhance our ability to get some interest going on the SW501D5A. Lastly, we are reviewing the possibility of having the Ft. Pierce project use MHI unit #3 instead of unit #1 in light of the apparent market interest in units 1 and 2, and the current Ft. Pierce construction schedule which is better suited for unit #3 than unit #1.

Mike Coleman is putting together a budget and program to monitor (from a technical perspective) and maintain the 501D5A and the 501Fs.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

With the shipment of two of the four units from MHI scheduled for August and no viable place to ship them, our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly.  We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

We will receive the $2 million when AES and TVA execute an interconnection agreement for AES' Haywood project. While it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month (50%), it's equally as likely that it will happen Q4. AES is currently under construction on their Haywood project, and as such, they need to get this agreement wrapped up ASAP. Our role in this is to utilize our resources (primarily our consultant who is a former TVA Director) to help AES through the process (and in doing so, we will receive our upside payment of $2 million). We are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in Q3.

We can talk about this before our conference call if you like.

Ben

Chris:

With the $1.5 million to ship MHI turbines 1 and 2, the summary of the numbers is the following:



Therefore, we would be about $300,000 over the original DASH.  These numbers do not include transaction and financing costs.  I will do a DASH amendment and am copying Louise on this email so that she is aware of what is going on.  The storeage would be in a bonded warehouse, so no duties would be due at this time.  On leads, we have a couple of new parties, but nothing concrete yet.  Ron has been working with one counterparty and may receive an offer in the near term.

Sounds good.  Couple of questions:

- Were shipping / storage costs included in original DASH?
- Is the amount approx $1.5MM?
- Any leads on the MHI's?

The proposed plan on the MHI units is to ship Units 1 and 2 to the US for storeage at a central location.  The storeage costs are significantly less than proposed by MHI and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be beneficial for a potential sale.  From an economic perspective, it would be better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly.  However, given a lack of any firm sale, the recommendation is to ship them to the US and store.  Let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with the shipment.

Thanks,
Brett

I have summarized the costs associated with shipping and storage of MHI Units 1&2 in the attached file.   << File: Ship_Storage Prop 092401.xls >> 

Other discussion worth noting --

?	Title will remain with original counterparty -- EBPH
?	We prefer that title and risk of loss pass at Port of Import; however; not a requirement if MHI decides to extract a large premium
?	Will require specific storage instructions from MHI (will make a request on tomorrow's call)
?	packing requirements to maintain warranty
?	other requirements (space heaters, etc.)
?	Inspection instructions 
?	Plan to submit a request to MHI that the Unit(s) be readied for shipment (est. Sept. 30 with written notice)
?	Carrier able to be at Port of Export by Oct. 22-31
?	Estimate 32 days from Port of Export to Port of Import


Please review and forward comments by tomorrow morning.  I will formalize for a discussion with Dave Duran and Ben Jacoby prior to the MHI phone call,

Thanks, Ron.

Phil -- I would appreciate if you would take the lead on developing a shipping and storage plan.  The plan should have a timeline w/ a discussion on the appropriate activity.  I would suggest that the first milestone will be our formal notification to MHI informing them to ready the units for shipping will occur on the Tuesday night call.  I would hope we would have packing instructions to them at that time or soon thereafter.  Do we have a preference on the packing or was the plan given to us by MHI appropriate?

Thank you for your input on the storage of the MHI Units 1 & 2.  The following is a summary of charges associated with shipping and storage (discussed this past Monday):

?	Cost for Shipping components located in Kobe, Japan ($500-600k for both units)
?	Cost for Shipping components located outside of Kobe ($200k for both units)
?	Handling from ship to storage (approx. $200k for both units)
?	Storage  ($13k per month for each unit)
?	Cargo Insurance (0.002 charge for the value of shipment, est. $40MM per unit, approx. $80k per unit)
?	Storage Insurance (0.0002 charge for the value of storage, est. $40MM per unit, approx. $8k per unit per [mos., 6 months, year?????])
?	DSU Insurance ($25k per unit per [mos., 6 months, year?????])
?	Custom charges (approx $__ k per unit per _______ (period))

We would propose to MHI that we would set up an entity who would provide the above services on behalf of MHI and the above actual charges would be passed through to E-Next (along with a fee that would be provided for MHI's account, approx -- $200k).  The title and risk of loss would be passed at the Port of Import.  The likely location for the stored units would be in or around Houston or Freeport, TX at a Bonded Facility.  We will continue to modify the proposal to address the needs of E-Next and future project structures.

I would appreciate confirmation from those who have provided the above estimates (and, response on the questions noted above).  In addition, please forward any other items that were overlooked.

Last, MHI has not provided a counter proposal for the storage of the units in Japan, but the above proposal is certainly more attractive.

Thanks, Ron.

As a follow up to our conversation early this week, I will have a draft site status report to you on Tuesday. What we've done is to take the site option list previously provided to you, and add a status column and a cost basis column. I'd like to sit down with you and Dave Duran to go over this, and also other information on Q1 to make sure my group is on track from your perspective. I could have a QBR package to you by late next week or early the following, depending on when you would like to get together.

I hope you have a good weekend.

Sounds good to me.

By the way, I was in Houston last week except Friday (had a meeting with FPL in Florida). Sorry I didn't come up to see you to talk more about this, or follow up with Canada. I guess I got my wires crossed because I thought in our meeting and calls the prior week that I was supposed to wait for further instructions before proceeding on transfer discussions with Canada.

In any case, Chris and I spoke today, and we are going to have a conference call with Brett this afternoon. He has already had discussions with Canada on a transfer price, thus establishing the bid - offer spread. Brett, Chris and I have already had various preliminary discussions on the shared turbine book, and how we think we should set it up. The rest of the transaction on the ABBs is understood from Canada's customer list and your e-mail below. 

We'll be able to wrap up a draft Turbine Book strategy as you requested shortly, and propose a transfer price on the ABB units.

Regards,

Ben

Hello, 

As I didn't hear anything last week on whether we had made progress on the transfer/sale of the ABB turbines (I know Ben was out too ) I thought I would put my thoughts in writing.  I am assuming that we are all on board with the fact that transferring these assets to the Turbine Book is the most efficient mechanism for dealing with the turbines going forward - please let me know if anyone thinks otherwise (excluding arguments about transfer pricing).

Transfer ABB turbines to the Turbine Book (under the management of Jacoby and Calger), capital charges to be picked up by the Turbine Book as of 7/01/01.   The Turbine Book is responsible for the turbines going forward.

Should a sale occur (negotiated by ECC) to any of the customers outlined in the documents, ECC has the right to buy back the assets at any time at the transfer price plus capital charge incurred during the period when the turbines were owned by the Turbine Book.  The call option expires 9/01/01 and can only be exercised for a sale to the counterparties in the document attached with the addition of Calpine for the purposes of a sale combined with the site (the call option for a Calpine sale is valid until 12/01/01).  If  ECC does not wish to pursue the sale to the counterparties in the document attached, then Jacoby can pursue these negotiations and if a sale is completed this year with these counterparties, the Turbine Book will receive a brokerage fee ($1 million) and ECC will pick up capital costs between 7/01/01 and the completion of the sale. 

Please agree to a transfer price for these turbines, if a price cannot be agreed between you, please let me have your arguments substantiating your transfer price and I will arbitrate on the number on Friday.  Let me know if anyone disagrees with moving forward in this way.

Regards

Louise

John:

Louise, Dave and I discussed the management of the MHI turbines the other day, and Louise seemed to be leaning toward joint management by Wiggs, Calger and me. Duran and I would like to know where we stand on this, as our response to Brett on the Ft. Pierce unit will change depending on how the units are to be managed on a going forward basis.

Dave and I would like to meet with you tomorrow to discuss this and our Midway, FL peaker. I will contact your assistant to determine when you're available.

Regards,

Ben

Bob and Wayne,

It appears that our commercial group is discussing whether to suspend payments on the MHI engines claiming Force Majeure, basing this on the recent terrorist activity. Is this a path we want to follow, and is this supported by Enron management?

I'm quite concerned that this will only lead to more confusion, high legal costs, and difficulty with disposing of these assets, similar to the problems that have been created with the Westinghouse D5A.

If this is supported by upper management, I would like to know so I am prepared to deal with the results of the situation.

Thanks!

Mike

As I didn't see a turbine list attached, just to confirm our conversation, the turbine book to be shared 1/3 by me, Calger, and Wiggs will inlclude the 3 x MHI501Fs, the 1 x 501D5A, and the ABB11Ns coming in from Canada.Please let me know if I've forgotten anything.

I'll get right on this.

Can you three get together and come up with a strategy for all the turbines and let me have some sort of summary document.

I am assuming that you three own the turbine book (33.3% each) and have the following turbines (let me know if I have forgotten any).



I would also like to see the outline of terms under which (i) the transfer of the ABB turbines from Canada and (ii), the terms under which Brett participates in the turbine book.  (You'll need to agree all this by Thursday, I will give you transfer number on Friday for the ABB turbines if one is not included in the report).

You guys need to discuss this together and please get me the information on Thursday (let me know if you want to discuss it or will just email me a copy).

Thanks

Louise

With the shipment of two of the four units from MHI scheduled for August and no viable place to ship them, our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly.  We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

No significant good news.

ABB:
- Canada leads still alive but not making any own payments
- Virgo trying to get a bid from ABB for the DLN combustor package and associated technology rights
- Thome got a bid from New brunswick Power which would net us $25K per month for the winter (NEPOOL ICAP less startup and O&M)
- Thome trying to structure a better bid from our desk (EPMI's NEPOOL ICAP bid = $160K per month, but we dont know the cost of transmission to NEPOOL)

501D5A:
- 2 brokers looking at the machines - no general interest

MHI501F
- 6 brokers are reviewing packages with their clients: no tangible bids yet
- Brett looked at MHI contract: can not terminate, but their is a provision for MHI and buyer to cooperate on resales - Brett to explore
- Brett offered these under a Brazil RFP; no response yet
- Allegheny/NEPCO: big news of the week.  NEPCO is bidding on a project Allegheny wants to do in Arizona using all four MHIs.  We are inserting ourselves into the process to ensure that (i) NEPCO prices the turbines and the EPC contract agressively; (ii) Allegheny understands that we can separate the turbines in case they just want to buy them.  Ben, Brett, Ron Tapscott and I to meet on this today.  ENA/NEPCO/Allegheny meeting tomorrow

7FA:
- Calpine finally withdrew their bid (after we mitigated their one concern re the project - BPA transmission)
- Negotiating with NRG: Their verbal bid is -$5MM to -$8MM, but they have been slow because they just lost 2 developers/tech guys.  We are offering them access to Turbopark so their return on equity improves; we are also offering up development/tech people: temporary or permanent as part of the deal; We told them we can discount the EPC contract or the equipment contracts or write them a check for the $5MM discount.
- Other project candidates we are working with include Black Hills, TransAlta, Mirant
- We are also seeing what other sites (in the east) could benefit from the 7FA train

Louise,

Here are the screen captures plus the latest long description version.  On the short desription the option price has been modified to $450k.  The $10,000 number was only a placeholder.

I understand the meeting initially scheduled for tomorrow for QBR and review of the site list will be rescheduled. I have spoken with accounting, and they are preparing final Q1 numbers which should allow us to get together next week subject to your availability. As soon as I have a draft report, I'll contact Tammie to schedule a meeting. In the mean time, attached please find a draft site status report as promised. Please let me know if you would like any other project information included in the report. There may be some changes to the dollars referenced in the report due to Q1 closeout, and I will provide you with any updates I receive.

As a follow up to our conversation early this week, I will have a draft site status report to you on Tuesday. What we've done is to take the site option list previously provided to you, and add a status column and a cost basis column. I'd like to sit down with you and Dave Duran to go over this, and also other information on Q1 to make sure my group is on track from your perspective. I could have a QBR package to you by late next week or early the following, depending on when you would like to get together.

Did you have further discussions with Jim Hughes?  I have consistently held the line with Global Assets that we would take at cost.  Their response has been that they will keep it.  Let me know.

Wes,
This relates to the Calme 501D5A turbine we discussed in your office with Ben Jacoby & Jeff Sommers.  To refresh your memory, Ben has a buyer identified, and is willing to accept the transfer of the costs of $22.9mm from Calme.  However, he does not want to take the carrying costs of $2.6mm Calme has incurred to date.  In the meeting, you said that you would discuss the transfer price with John/Louise.  We are being asked for coding so Global Assets can transfer of the full amount.
 
Please advise,
Jody

Please provide me with the company number and cost element that the Westinghouse Turbine should be transferred to.
 
Thanks,

Louise:

I have a call in to Ben to discuss the idea.  With respect to your message on Steve Pearlman, I worked with him for about a year.  He is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the power industry.  He sometimes has a tendency to over-analyze issues, but I think he understands risks in the industry much more than many people in our organization.  He has closed and can close transaction.  I have a lot of respect for him and I think he will more than pay for himself in the long-run (responding to your question on how much he will make).

Brett

What I was trying to call you about was an idea.  The way Ben and Chris currently run the turbine book is they share everything 50:50 - upsides and downsides.  I thought it might be a good idea to involve you so the turbine book is split 33:33:33.  Obviously there is a transfer price out to projects (internal and Riogen would be included) but this would mean our successful turbine team would have all the right incentives to assist you with the Mitsubishis.

If you think its a good idea - please talk to Ben or Chris (Calger) who have discussed this themselves.

You would need an out for RioGen agreed upfront.

Regards

Louise

Louise,

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

Regards,

Chip Schneider

Louise:

Welcome back.

As I indicated in my voice-mail, I have to go to Knoxville, TN for Wednesday meetings with AES and TVA on our Haywood project. I will call you tomorrow morning to answer any questions you have on the turbine report or other activities. I will also be in Houston all day Thursday and Friday.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,

Ben

Louise:

Regarding the potential for Enron to work on another Vitro type project, the attached email gives the name of the company with whom we were discussing the turbine sale.  We are trying to find out more information on the project and will forward that to you as we receive it.  If you would like me to deal with someone directly in Mexico, please let me know who that should be.  We are also working with Maria Elena Garcia to develop potential customers in Mexico for a straight turbine sale.  She has indicated that she believes there may be some additional potential for cogen applications with these units.

Thanks,
Brett

Brett,

The name of the Mexican company is Energia Industrial Rio Colorado SA de CV. The company is located in the Mexican State of Sonora (Mexico), near to the US border. The project was originally projected to deliver power inside the fence (co-generation) and to the US (California).

I left a voice mail with the broker. I'll keep you updated on any news I may have.

Diego

Louise, 

I would not take a $10MM hit on the Mitsubishis right now - we have just started to market these and there seems to be some interest (even if it appears to be flaky).  If we forced a QIII sale (drop dead date - you are fired if it doesn't happen), I think we might lose as much as $10MM - $20MM.    Although I am not comfortable with our  overall  turbine position, I am comfortable with our current approach.   ABB liquidity is more of a concern even though it is a significantly smaller exposure.   

Regards,

Chris Calger

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this?  

How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September?  

As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward.

Louise
