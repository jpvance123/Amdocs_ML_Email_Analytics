Thanks Charlie.  Except for Enron, Recruiting has gone very well.  I
guess you can't win them all.  I am waiting for one more offer before I
make a decision.  I will most likely end up in Houston back at El Paso.


If I end up back in Houston, we should grab lunch a couple of times.

Keep in touch.

Congratualtions, Will!  May God bless you and your family.  She's a
beautiful baby.

How is recruiting going?   Any idea where you think you will end up.
I'm
sorry it did not work out at Enron.  I know that you will do well
wherever
you go.


Charlie

Sure.  I thought you said Friday.  That's actually better for us, because I
had to turn down an invitation from my sister in brother-in-law on Friday
night.  Do you want to have lunch on Friday?

You still headed down this afternoon?  Where are you staying tonight?  I
plan to head down sometime this evening.  I hope to get out of here a little
early but I've got a hearing this am and don't really know what the day will
be like.  Either way, I don't plan on hunting this evening.  If you aren't
staying out at the trailer, I take it that it is ok if I do anyway.

Chris

Looks like my mom will be staying with Paul both nights at the trailer.
I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.  Apparently Paul did not think about
the fact that you may want/need to stay there.

   Anyway,  I've now put the key under the wooden step platform at the
   trailer so you can free access to the trailer whenever you wish
   regardless of anyone being there (absent this weekend obviously).  I
   told Paul I was going to do this so you and Weldon could have this
   access. ( FYI - Previously, Weldon only stayed there when one of us was
   there.)  There is a slight chance that my mom and Paul may want to use
   the trailer later in the season for a weekend with my sister's kids but
   nothing is planned currently.  That's about the only other scenario I
   can see where it will not be available.

   As I mentioned my plans currently are to hunt:

   Fri, Nov 9th pm - Sun, Nov 11th pm  ((Some decent rutting activity)
   Fri Nov 16th pm - Mon, Nov 19th pm  (Rut should be full tilt here)
   Fri Nov 23rd pm - Sun, Nov 25th am  (May not get to hunt this weekend)

   I should be staying at the trailer most, but not all, of those nights as
   Melissa will likely stay in Cuero some of those nights and I 'll need to
   help her out with the kiddos a night or two.  We'll see.

   As for opening weekend, looks like the weather will be OK.  This past
   weekend, I saw several does and 3 small bucks.  Paul saw a 3.5-4.5 yr
   old 16" 8 pt that was OK but not a shooter.  The young bucks are trying
   to start chasing but that's not uncommon. There still are not an
   abundance of rubs so I now the rut is not about th launch.  I would say
   that the peak rut may be a bit earlier this year but should still be
   somewhere between the 10th and 25th of Nov.  I cannot stress enough how
   important it is to concentrate your hunting during this period.  Chances
   of seeing a large buck at a feeder after Nov 30th are quite a bit lower.

   Let me know what your plans are whenever you make them.


   Good Luck,

   Charlie

I saw a Money news commentator on yesterday morning, a  woman,  she said that the people who invested in the stock market in late  99 through the uprise of the market in 2000 will have to wait decades  for  the market to reach those levels again.  What do you think?  It came  on a 5 yesterday morning, the channel, the name of the woman I do not  know.

Charlie,

Large cap growth stock to consider is Concord EFS.   Ticker is CEFT.
Provides
electronic authorization services for purchases, settlement services,
clearing
house operations, and funds transfers.  Steady uptrend over the last three
years
with little sensitivity to  market swings.   Very highly recommended stock
with
10 strong buy recommendations.   EPS growth in 30-40% range, and PEG of
1.5.
Looks like a good stock to dampen volatility while still getting positives
of the
growing e-commerce volume/dollars/transaction numbers.




Paul

I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
it
is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
- it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
thinking
that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
Love, Margaret

If you can leave the airport by 1:30, make it to dook by 2:00, leave dook
by 2:45 (3:00 at the absolute latest), then you'll probably be alright.
Cameron should take all of about 10 minutes to lose your excitement over,
then you can walk around and check out all the ugly pussy that plagues the
campus, then see a bunch of yankee butt pirates circle jerking in the quad,
buy yourself a championship t-shirt with jiz all over it (but they won it
with heart!), you can be out of there in 45 minutes easy!!  Without any
traffic delays, you'll be east of Raleigh where we can meet at 3:45 or 4:00
at the McDonalds at Hwy 42 and I-40 (write that down, it's about 10-15
minutes east of Raleigh).  If you get stuck west of Raleigh in a traffic
snarl, you could be there for 1-2 hours.  I work in Chapel Hill on
Wednesdays and won't drive back on I-40 if it's after 3:00, I take a back
route.

Let me give you directions to Orton just in case, it's easy.  I-40 from
Raleigh to Wilmington, as you approach Wilmington take a right at a big
light on Smith Creek Parkway (new since your day, it's just before Market
Street), go about 1-2 miles and it will end, take a right on 23rd St, pass
the airport on your right, road will come to an end again, take a left, I
think this is Hwy 133 South which takes you around/through nig-town
Wilmington, cross the Cape Fear River and follow signs to Southport staying
on Hwy 133 South which will go straight to Orton, follow the signs into the
gate and the house is on the right once you enter the gate.  From the
airport without major traffic it will take a good 2 1/2 hours without
stopping, say 3 hours with a pissing 4 year old!!

Gate House phone number 910-371-9240
My work number 919-552-6506
My cell phone 919-662-6711

Wesie and I will try to leave at 3:30 so we can meet at 4:00.  Call me when
you get to the airport and let me know what the deal is.  I'm in Chapel
Hill on Wednesday so you could reach me on my cell phone.  I won't get
e-mail on Wednesday.

Analysts are worried about exposure to California utility receivables if
PCG and EIX go bankrupt.

No, did you?

Hard to believe that its' still falling after today's news:

HOUSTON, Jan. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN - news) today
announced that the company will significantly exceed previously forecasted
 fourth quarter recurring earnings of $0.22 to $0.25 per share. In
addition, the company also reaffirmed that it is comfortable with the upper
range
of current
estimates for 2001, which will represent an increase over 2000 of about 30
percent.

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Bobby
