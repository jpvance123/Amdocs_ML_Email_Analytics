Julie, here is a draft of the itinerary.  I still need to doublecheck times, phone numbers, etc., but this is the schedule.  I'm leaving in a few minutes, so needed to send you this before it is finalized.

Thanks Dan,  Each of my VP's conduct teleconference calls with their field employees every Monday starting after Stan's staff meeting.  Your guys a more than welcome to join them and I'll copy my guys with your memo to let them know.

I am conducting a two day trip to the field after Thanksgiving, traveling to Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle and Central Oklahoma.  I will be meeting with Beaver assets employees.  If someone familiar with the status of Duke can go along that would be helpful.  I have the company plane to get us around and will be spending the night in Oklahoma City.  Contact Amelia and she can get you an itinerary.

Phil,
       Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).  Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.  Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?  Let me know.

Dan

Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

Please note that it was preferred that the TV monitor be the standard size (as we had on 41) and the monitor be on a higher cart/stand so the group could view it from respective areas.  The current TV and stand are rare large and protrude in the walkway in addition to not functioning.  It should be noted the cable is rather short and does not allow flexibility and movement.  Is the cable functioning?  We appreciate the current situation but, would like to resolve in a timely manner.  Please advise.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Summary Risk Data as of 10/25/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	         51	
Active Physical al Deals	         35	
P&L  Daily	-111,355.53	
VaR	 441,917.71

Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

I tired to get you some Gallery Bowl tickets from Reliant but, no luck.
I will pay you back for lunch next week too.  Cheers.  Have a great holiday.

In preparation for your Wednesday meeting with Heath, here are some supporting documents.  Will be calling on Tuesday to answer any questions.

1. This is the main argument and rebuttal document  
2. This is the document Heath presented to his investment advisory board, incl. Lay and Whalley  
3. This is a presentation describing the current skills of the team and ensuing organizational structure of the deal  
4. Some backup numbers on valuation this is IdleAire's   and Xtransco's  note they are based on different business models.
5. Some backup documentation on fuel idling burn  (we are conducting tests with Grady Olson that are yielding the same results) and results from a prelim survey we conducted on truck drivers regarding their views and interest in value prop  (note these results are very rough--you should receive a better version before your meeting no Wednesday.)

I will be in Lake Tahoe starting Wednesday morning, but am reachable 24/7 on my mobile 713-269-1777.

Danny:
This completes your direct reports accomplishments.  Please note that two-online contracts (#42895, #42941) were approved by Craig Buehler.  
Also that I spoke with HR about the termination letters and big mistake.  Apparently many people received the letters due to massive mailing.  Please note that if you receive letter, it halts your contribution to your savings plan.  I will send out notice to your direct reports in case someone else received same form letter.
Dave Neubauer called in to see if there was any news on Northern.  Word is out that Citibank is ready to proceed on Trading deal.
I saw that you called in today but, when I called you were working out.  I spoke with Ben who told me about the electronic scooter (the coolest thing he got for Christmas).  Everything is fine.  Have a relaxing holiday!

Summary Risk Data as of 10/26/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	52	
Active Physical Deals	35	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	78.0	
VaR ($thousands)	450.8	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

The on-line contracts Request 42975 and 42965, Route 1 were approved by Karen Brostad.

The report for Stan was sent to Cindy (only had three reports) to send in.  You were copied on the email.  

FYI on the move.  Pam Daily received information today from Stan and Rod that the people in the 3AC (Lowry's group) have to be moved by January 18th the lease is being terminated early.  Kim Watson called Pam to get status on our move and Pam seemed overwhelmed by this information.  Kim has graciously volunteered to assist Pam in coordination of the move and how the moves will affect our move.  Kim and I discussed and came up with several alternatives.  Kim also suggested that we both assist Pam as we have to get Market Services and the groups placed one floor soon.  Pam wanted to move some of the people on 44 and 45 where our group was to moved and move them again when space opened?  Kim suggested either 47 or the 13th floor.  Mucho space on 47 and I took a rough count of the 13th floor.  10 offices and 82 cubicles.  Some of the cubes are very spacious.

Call me at home or on the cell tomorrow if you need anything.

Danny,

I am sending you our latest presentation.  I am very disturbed by yesterday's events, I knew many traders that worked between WTC and WFC--yet I realize that our work has to continue.  I don't know if you will be flying with Mark this week, at any case you now have the latest version of our business concept.  If you have any questions please call me at 30315 or (mobile) 713 269 1777.

Hamd

FYI - I made my staff burn the midnight oil last night putting together TW/NNG revenue summaries for review by the bankers that Rod/Kevin are working with.  Thought you might me interested in the report.  It gives a nice snapshot of our activity with our major counterparties.

First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).

As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made.  With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.

Poor Performing Programs
The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.  Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.  In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.

Workload Distribution
The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system "bottlenecks".  We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.  Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. 

Improved Close Monitoring
The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.  

Communication Strategy Implement
The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.  This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance.

Summary Risk Data as of 11/26/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	     83	
Active Physical Positions	     38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	    69.7 	
VaR ($thousands)	   147.9 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	      0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Thanks Dan,  Each of my VP's conduct teleconference calls with their field employees every Monday starting after Stan's staff meeting.  Your guys a more than welcome to join them and I'll copy my guys with your memo to let them know.

I am conducting a two day trip to the field after Thanksgiving, traveling to Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle and Central Oklahoma.  I will be meeting with Beaver assets employees.  If someone familiar with the status of Duke can go along that would be helpful.  I have the company plane to get us around and will be spending the night in Oklahoma City.  Contact Amelia and she can get you an itinerary.

Phil,
       Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).  Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.  Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?  Let me know.

Dan

Was this resolved?  You were going to speak to Stan as Mary Landrum suggested that he was interested.  I would think with the recent events at Enron, we would not be interested? Please advise.

Persons viewing this Special  Program will have a better understanding of the following:
Can the industry effectively secure the massive  infrastructure within the United States?   If we cannot, what methodology do we utilize to determine and address  our greatest risks?
What is the REAL threat to the gas  infrastructure?  Do we understand  what companies are trying to protect against?
How to effectively evaluate your current system  security.
Proactive steps in creating alliances with homeland  security, law enforcement and trade associations
Our 'new normal' will not be like the last?but what is  the proper level of awareness we should have?  Should we look to foreign companies as  our 'new normal' what may already be their standard operating  procedures?
We may need to sacrifice "convenience" for the benefit  of better security, but what does that mean?  
To increase security we will need to share less system  information as widely?what information should we begin to hold more  closely?

 The broadcast will be aired in three segments.  Each segment will follow the  model:
 Preparedness, Prevention,  Protection, Response & Recovery
 
 Physical Assets  	 Human Assets  	 Regulatory Response &  Expectation 	
 Risk  Assessment  Existing System  Security  Proactive  Measures 	 The Pre-Event  Process  During the Crisis or  Event  Post Event  Process 	 Increased Facilities  Security  New  Guidelines  Rate  Relief

attached please find two agreements - a draft of a mutual services agmt and an employment agmt.  These are drafts to stimulate discussion and comments.  They need to be cleaned up and tightened and in some cases filled in entirely.  There may well be significant changes in approach so do not become too caught up in the minor matters

Let me and Colleen know your thgts....

Have a great Christmas

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Pam:

Please note that Dave Neubauer requested to move from the 39th floor to EB1354.  The EB1354 office is empty and ready for move-in.  

Danny has approved the move and the location on the 39th floor has been challenging for Dave in regards to administrative assistance and when staff/employees are trying to locate him. 

Please advise when we schedule Dave for a move.  It would be preferred to wait until Linda returns from vacation (week of October 19th) so we can properly handle the move.  

If you have any questions, please call me at x33597.  Thanks.

Please note that it was preferred that the TV monitor be the standard size (as we had on 41) and the monitor be on a higher cart/stand so the group could view it from respective areas.  The current TV and stand are rare large and protrude in the walkway in addition to not functioning.  It should be noted the cable is rather short and does not allow flexibility and movement.  Is the cable functioning?  We appreciate the current situation but, would like to resolve in a timely manner.  Please advise.

Please note that the TV monitor is still not functioning.  Joan advised that someone was to come by Thursday to check out situation and I did not see individual by the time I departed at 5:20.    I was out of the office Friday and not certain of any activity that day.

Tracy and Dan,

Steve and I revised the business development slides for Stan's presentation.  I'm waiting for Kim Watson to update the TransPecos slide and will forward when complete.  Will forward final rendition when completed, probably on Monday.

attached please find two agreements - a draft of a mutual services agmt and an employment agmt.  These are drafts to stimulate discussion and comments.  They need to be cleaned up and tightened and in some cases filled in entirely.  There may well be significant changes in approach so do not become too caught up in the minor matters

Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.



STORAGE STATISTICS:
		Transactions (Bcf)		Annual Revenue ($millions)
1997			  49				$  5.5
1998			  39				$  6.7		
1999			  40				$  6.7
2000			  85				$10.7
2001			119				$21.2

FYI - The current status is that TW faxed Richardson Products a letter from our Credit department informing them they no longer satisfy the creditworthiness standards in the tariff and need to provide security of at least $1.7 million dollars by Thursday, January 3rd to avoid suspension of services.  Paul Cherry's counterpart, Herb Truelove, called back to say that TW should not combine the gas sales with their firm transportation contracts and they should only provide security for their $130 thousand dollars worth of firm transportation.  We countered that regardless of whether the exposure is from transportation services, storage, imbalances work orders or gas sales, we include all potential exposure when  enforcing our global credit policy.  If they do not pay by January 3rd, we will force them into prepayment status and discuss not accepting their nominations.  

Paul, Kim, TK and I are all working this issue hard and I believe we have it under control.

Rick

FYI - 

In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice.  They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues.  We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it.

Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority.  We will keep you informed.

Rick

Jean -

As requested, here is the breakdown of the costs of purchasing the TFT flat panels from Corp.  GSS is still working on the cost of the plasma, and I will get to you as soon as possible.

First Request for Gas Logistics:

50 15" flat panels @ $200.00/unit - $10,000.00
5   18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit -    2,250.00

Total:				   $12,250.00

2nd Request (Mary Kay Miller):

12 15" flat panels @ $200.00/unit - $ 2,400.00
4   18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit -    1,800.00

Total:				   $ 4,200.00

3rd Request (Verbal for Dan McCarty):

10 18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit - $ 4,500.00


As we have discussed, we still do not have approval from the Bankruptcy court to officially sell them to you, but we can "loan" them to you and once approval is gained, we can square away the cost.

Please call me at X58416 if you have any questions.

Have a great New Year!

Regards,

Mike

Danny:
Please see your travel itinerary for SGA Conference.  Note that Sunday departure was required as no Monday flights would get you in time for conference and were connections (example, American flight departing at 6:10 am with arrival into Palm Beach at 11:50.
Note, there is a direct later flight on Sunday night, 6:45 pm with arrival into Palm Beach 10:09.  Please advise if you want to change to later flight.
As you can see it is challenging on the return flight too.  I booked you out of Fort Lauderdale as no direct flights from Palm Beach were available.  The  earlier flight from Palm Beach was a connection with arrival at 7:00 pm into Houston so the  3:04 direct flight out Fort Lauderdale was a better choice.  Fort Lauderdale is about 40 miles from Palm Beach. Please advise if you wish to make any changes.

For your info-  I will be having a tailgate party both pre and post game, regardless of outcome.  It is located at 9th and S on the east side of 9th street towards the southwest end of the lot where there is a large billboard advertising a 30$$ ++  Jackpot ( at least that's what it had on last weekend)   Please feel free to have the group join in if you get there in enough time.  Otherwise I will see you all at the game around 10:30.  Mary Kay

Joan, could you please set up a churn request to relocate Dave Neubauer's Houston office ECN3963 to ECN1354. Julie Armstrong (x33597) should be able to give you company/cost center for the move charges. Julie requested setting up this move after Linda Wehring's return next Monday, so request middle of next week churn date. Please also check with Linda (x36040) on Monday to see if she has anything to add to this request. Since this is not his primary office, there will not be very much to move other than equipment and furniture. Also should check 1354 to see if there is a marker board in there already or if we need to move one in there for him. 

Pat, could you please outfit ECN1354 with VP style furniture (granite racetrack, Mueller chairs, black drum table, along with Barritt guest chairs if they are not already in there) before next week? This will prevent moving the furniture from level 39, then having to replace it when I back-fill the office next week.

Thanks for your help!

Pam:

Please note that Dave Neubauer requested to move from the 39th floor to EB1354.  The EB1354 office is empty and ready for move-in.  

Danny has approved the move and the location on the 39th floor has been challenging for Dave in regards to administrative assistance and when staff/employees are trying to locate him. 

Please advise when we schedule Dave for a move.  It would be preferred to wait until Linda returns from vacation (week of October 19th) so we can properly handle the move.  

If you have any questions, please call me at x33597.  Thanks.

Julie, here is a draft of the itinerary.  I still need to doublecheck times, phone numbers, etc., but this is the schedule.  I'm leaving in a few minutes, so needed to send you this before it is finalized.

Thanks Dan,  Each of my VP's conduct teleconference calls with their field employees every Monday starting after Stan's staff meeting.  Your guys a more than welcome to join them and I'll copy my guys with your memo to let them know.

I am conducting a two day trip to the field after Thanksgiving, traveling to Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle and Central Oklahoma.  I will be meeting with Beaver assets employees.  If someone familiar with the status of Duke can go along that would be helpful.  I have the company plane to get us around and will be spending the night in Oklahoma City.  Contact Amelia and she can get you an itinerary.

Phil,
       Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).  Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.  Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?  Let me know.

Dan

*The decrease in active deals is from the early termination of both the NNG & TW ISDA agreements with RMTC effective 12/14/2001.  The increase in VaR is because the TW terminated contracts with RMTC have not yet been replaced.  The VaR is currently over the ETS VaR limit of $1,000,000.

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Dan,

I do not know that we decided not to send anything to these employees who received letters in error as a consequence of a mistake by our outsource suppliers. I had understood that they were notifying people that these were errors and correct the information accordingly.

Cynthia, can you confirm for me and the others on this email that we have this in hand?

Thanks

David

     Over the holidays I received not one, but three, notifications letting me know that I had been terminated and explaining my rights under my 401K.  I also received a half a dozen calls at home from other current employees who had received these (including Julie Armstrong), all of whom were not amused.  I understand that this matter has been brought to your attention, but you have chosen not to notify any current employees that the 401K notices were sent out in error.  I suggest that you rethink this asap.

Dan,
Like you, I also received termination letters from Hewitt (as did Stan Horton, Jim Hughes, Bill Cordes and others).  Last week, I asked Dan Batista from my staff to contact Corporate Benefits to investigate what happened and to what extent.  Dan has reported the following:
 
"Termination letters" were erroneously sent by Hewitt to several active employees.  There was a problem with employee status information that was transmitted via an SAP interface from ENE to Hewitt for the 11/30/01 pay period.  A number of employee records loaded into the Hewitt system with a termination date equal to their employment date.  As the Hewitt system picked up these incorrectly terminated records, letters were triggered to employees informing them of their rights as terminated employees.  The error was identified and has been fixed in the Hewitt system.  All records were reported to be fixed by 12/26/01.  Employees who received termination letters can log into the Savings Plan System under "personal data" to verify that their status has been corrected to "active".  
 
We have asked Corporate Benefits for a listing of employees who received the letters so the HR Reps can follow up with an explanation to those effected.

12 15" flat panels @ $200.00/unit - $ 2,400.00 
4   18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit -    1,800.00 

Total:                             $ 4,200.00 

3rd Request (Verbal for Dan McCarty): 

10 18" flat panels @ $450.00/unit - $ 4,500.00 


As we have discussed, we still do not have approval from the Bankruptcy court to officially sell them to you, but we can "loan" them to you and once approval is gained, we can square away the cost.

Please call me at X58416 if you have any questions. 

Have a great New Year! 

Regards, 

Mike

Danny,
This is the summary of the commercial terms proposed to IdleAire (all the terms are still subject to further negotiation with IA).  We think we have something solid to work with provided we receive $12-15 mm in total funding over next 6 mos.  I greatly appreciate your continued support and your help in finding us some capital.
Cheers'
Hamd

Subject: Talking Points

Brad - I could not agree with you more.  We do not want to negotiate this i=
n the public arena. I felt the stories in the Calgary Herald, National Post=
 were unfortunate in timing and substance.=20

 As per your suggestion I have eliminated the last 2 bullets and attached t=
he talking points here.  The last bullet in the revised talking points was =
devised to take media pressure off of both us and the Producers.  There has=
 been an incredible amount of political hay being made with this project an=
d it has realized an inordinate amount of media attention.  We need to give=
 the media (only if asked or questioned - not to be released) some reasonab=
le expectations for time frames.  In any discussions we have with governmen=
t bodies or if questioned by media representatives we need to make it very =
clear we cannot discuss the terms of the proposal at this time and help the=
m understand that the Producers will have only received an executive summar=
y and the meeting in January will be the first glance at a large complex pr=
oposal and is intended to be the beginning of a process.  Outlining this ti=
meframe clearly stating there will be no immediate results from either rece=
iving the proposal or the early January meeting will hopefully set the medi=
a and government minds at rest that there is no story here for a while so n=
o need to dig further.  Normally a timeframe and a process is a better answ=
er than no comment.

Please let me know if you have any other concerns or would like to see addi=
tional revisions. =20

   I firmly believe the less said in public before jan 8 discussions with=

   I'd prefer to keep advertisements down to a minimum and keep to the=20

   collapse the third and fourth bullets into one very concise bullet=20
   indicating a proposal being sent before year end to be followed up by a=

   meeting in early Jan - I would not say anything further about whats in=

   the proposal nor the attributes.=20
   Again, in the less said the better mode - I'd delete the last two=20

I appreciate Tony's email on Mr. Kvisle's comments and timing and can=20
understand how these types of things occur.  It indicates to me we need to=
=20
keep to a very tight script in all discussions (media and politicians=20
