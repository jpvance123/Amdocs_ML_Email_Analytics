One point you were checking was the CA.  Any luck?

I called pulled off track on a couple of things, but I can get back to this now.  Billy Fleenor says he has some thoughts on structure from a M-to-M standpoint.  Are you guys interested in having that conversation at this time?

Any progress on drafting a letter of intent, or are you still waiting on feedback from the team?

Just let me know.  Thanks!

Herman/Billy,

This is still very early in the process, but some thought as to structure options for earning recognition might be worthwhile.

Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?

Kay, looks great to me.  I would prefer to leave the benchmark open and be able to talk the counterparty through how it will be established (due diligence on plants, higher target means greater sharing % for ENE).  As far as cancellation is concerned, I think that it would be a good idea to include a right of cancellation for NRG based on a percentage of the benchmark established.  Something to the effect that NRG will have the annual right to terminate the agreement if we cannot achieve __% of the annual gross margin target.

Thanks-
Bill

Attached is a rough outline of the information that we might want to incorporate into a LOI with NRG.  We can discuss this at the 10 AM meeting.

Subject:=09Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contr=
acts


One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is par=
ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com=
modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh=
ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=
 complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat=
ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s=
etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master =
contracts.

=09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that =
will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w=
hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort=
h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti=
ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l=
anguage be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

=09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D=
ate, the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretio=
n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or a=
ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins=
trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi=
liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) =
or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp=
ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent =
of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not=
ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after =
the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not =
affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, "Owed"=
 shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o=
f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term=
ination Date.  =09

=09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver=
ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t=
he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f=
aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c=
onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t=
hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva=
nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi=
ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit=
y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr=
ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, =
netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ=
t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio=
n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow=
ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of =
the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties =
would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno=
wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip=
al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia=
tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth=
erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=
 it relates to Section ___.

=09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre=
ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default=
ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv=
es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may =
include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w=
hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin=
g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag=
reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=
 Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

=09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du=
e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p=
ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se=
toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha=
s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l=
aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group =
will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic=
tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, =
prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require=
d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=
 than Events of Default (e.g. "Affected Party" under ISDA).  Finally, when =
incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw=
are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term=
s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app=
licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should =
remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=
 setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff la=
nguage into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determ=
ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi=
ll need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist a=
ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of=
 preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua=
lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be=
 able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distribut=
ed shortly.

=09If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabet=
h Sager at 713-853-6349.

Craig, as promised, attached is the draft LOI that we discussed yesterday.  We will send some hard copies via overnight mail as well.  I have been talking to Elaine to schedule June 13th, or your soonest available date, for a follow up meeting in Houston.  

We have recently implemented several similar services deals with municipals and industrials in other regions of the country.  This experience combined with Enron's strong trading presence in the Northeast will allow us to develop a proposal for NRG's sizeable Northeast generation portfolio that is mutually beneficial.

We'll look forward to meeting soon and moving things forward.  Thanks.
