Rajesh,

Attached are versions of the COU agreement that Clay is using with OLNG for the spot cargoes. Dan Rogers said the one that he hopes to use going forward is the one named "EIGSC-OLNG-VESSEL-CONDITIONS-OF-USE".

We should discuss this next week as per my previous e-mail.

Best Regards,

Paul

Todd,

I will remind Hiro to resend the draft COU for our review. He emailed the 
draft in December but we were unable to open the document. With respect to 
the cool down cargo I intend to wait until we have an agreed plan for DPC 
supply before discussing the cargo with OLNG. Our intent is to make sure the 
cool down cargo is a pre-lift of DPC's fixed quantity obligation regardless 
of the contract start date.

Shubh,

Per our conversation today, it seems that the best thing to do will be to have a conference call on this subject next week when Dan, Wayne, Tony, Clay, and Rajesh are all available.

As I stated, Das Island does not currently require a COU and Dan is in hopes of negotiating a "short form" COU with Oman LNG for the Qalhat port. Enron is currently using such a "short form" for its spot trades with Oman. I will be happy to forward this to you if you so desire.

MOL may push for a more definitive document. We should discuss this next week.

Regards,

Paul

Subject:	Conditions of Use of Ports/Terminals

Ram,

As discussed, we need to obtain a copy of the Dabhol Port Regulations from MMB urgently, the reason being:

MOL have asked for a copy of the Conditions of Use (COU) or any similar document that may be required to be signed by the master of SS Lakshmi for her being allowed to enter the Dabhol port.  I have been given to understand that generally the COU or any similar document, as prescribed by the concerned Port Authorities, among other things outlines the liabilities of the ship owner in case of any damage to the port facilities while the ship uses the port.  
Since the Dabhol port falls within the jurisdiction of MMB, the draft Dabhol Port Regulations as forwarded to GOM by MMB may possibly include such a document.  In order to obtain a copy of the draft regulations, would you consider writing to MMB or talking to the CEO?  I leave it to your better judgement.


Tony & Paul,

We need to get a copy of the COU for the Qalhat & Das Island loading ports.  Both the SPAs specifically call for DPC (or GSCL and/or the master of the LNG ship) to sign all conditions for using the load port.

I shall call you after a few hours.  In the meanwhile, I propose to send an interim reply to MOL tomorrow morning (India time) saying that we are arranging for the COUs and shall forward a copy of the same shortly.

Best regards,
Shubh

Rajesh,

Did you receive the e-mail that I sent on Thursday with the COU agreement document? I sent it to your e-mail address that is in the Outlook address book. If you want, I can re-send to this or another address.

The COU do not fall under my area. Dan Rogers has handled this in the past with the help of outside counsel from King & Spalding (Philip Weems). I spoke with Dan last week about the DPC COU and he has some thoughts about it that you should be aware of. For example, short form vs. long form and timing of signing of the document. Does Clay want you to coordinate your efforts with Dan?

Regards,

Paul

Please forward to me your new phone numbers and e-mail address.

Heard you on the call today saying that Oman LNG was visiting Houston.  There is a CoU with Oman that Clay gave me yesterday.  This is for HG ship and Clay mentioned that this was all negotiated.  I am working to get this executed asap.  Does this fall under ytour belt.  Dan Roggers has drafted this.

Shubh,

I spoke with Dan today on this issue.  As you and I discussed there are basically two CoU issues that you are pursuing.
A CoU for use at Dabhol.  As Dan suggested in the message below, the CoU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project would probably be a good starting point for the CoU to be used at Dabhol.  However it will need to be coordinated with the other project documents and the DPC/GSC C/P for Lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the P&I insurers for Lakshmi.
We (Enron) has also negotiated a 'short form' of CoU that has been used by Oman LNG for the ships loading Enron's spot cargoes loaded at their terminal.  As Dan has said, since OLNG drives their own CoU we waited until they proposed a CoU and we then negotiated to the final version.  Usually the purchaser waits until the seller presents the CoU and then they negotiate it.  However, we understand that MOL, acting for GSC, want to get this CoU checked off with their P&I insurers so they will have one less thing to do when the ship comes into service.  We could go to OLNG and request their CoU and send it to MOL for them to review with their legal advisers and their P&I.  Alternately we could request that OLNG use for the Lakshmi, the same CoU as we (Enron) have negotiated for the spot cargoes.  Not having been involved in the negotiations, I do not know how they differ or even if GSC will want to use the version used by Enron. 

Dan has said that with the complications now existing with ship lenders and the Dabhol PTN, he is snowed under and is not able to work on CoUs.  Philip Weems of King & Spalding (outside legal assistance) worked on both the MetGas and the Enron spot cargo documents as he has very valuable experience on these issues.  Dan has recommended that DPC use Philip but with the current situation, you may not want to get into additional legal fees or even start an exercise that may be totally in vain.
Please advise of your thoughts on the above.  I will phone you early tomorrow morning, Houston time.
 
Tony

Attached please find a copy of the COU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project.  Please remember that this document is custom-tuned to match-up with the liability, risk and insurance allocation mechanism set out in the MetGas LNG SPA.  This document would probably be a good starting point for the COU to be used under the Oman LNG SPA and the AdGas LNG SPA; however it will need to be coordinated with those documents and ultimately agreed by Greenfield's Marine P&I insurers.   We used Philip Weems of King & Spalding for outside legal assistance on this document (he has very valuable experience on these issues and documents) and recommend for the sake of efficiency and cost savings that we do so on any Dabhol Port COU as well. 

Kind regards,
Dan
