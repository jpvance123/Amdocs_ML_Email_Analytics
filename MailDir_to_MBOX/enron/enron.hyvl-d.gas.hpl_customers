I'm not sure what a traunch is but according to Mick Walters this deal has 
been in evergreen and this deal is a firming up (renegotiating) of the 
contract.  That said, it is basically a new deal to us.  We have newly marked 
volumes.

Sandi,

The deal David is referencing relates to an unbooked traunch under contract 
96001783.   This traunch had not previously been booked because the contract 
had had a price re-opening provision.  I'm fairly certain contract 96001783 
is already included in the data room documentation.

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks

Formosa has received the contract and asked to use "day of flow" Gas Daily 
rather than two day after for both excess and buy back gas.  Can you please 
make this change and I will resend?

already in the system, I will be able to get the check out the next day.

Dan,
I need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with Intercontinental 
Terminals Company.
This company is located at 1943 Battleground Road, P.O. Box 698, Deer Park 
Texas 77536-0698.
My contact is Lynn Bingham (281) 884-0312. They have showed interest in doing 
a  fixed rate. That 
is why I would like for them to sign a Master contract at this time. That way 
when we agree on a price
we can act on it without having to wait on getting them approved. They passed 
along to me that they
are a sister company of Global Octane. Call me with any questions.

Bob, 
Hope your vacation was great.  I was up in Michigan and had a great time.  
There are a couple issues still to be worked out on the contract.  Please let 
me know and I will get an agreement drawn up.  

1)  Baseload Volume -   Based on historicals your average is roughly 9,000 
mmbtu/d with swing from 6,000 - 12,000
 We can work this two ways: 1)  Use 9,000 per day as baseload with swings 
priced @ a GD and undertakes bought back at a GD
     2)  You can nominate some number between 6,000 and 12,000 prior to bid 
week and this becomes your baseload        number.  With swings priced @ a GD 
and undertakes bought back at a GD
2)  Gas Daily price - 
 Since this is no notice swing we use HSC GD mid less (.01) for all takes 
over baseload quantity two days after flow.
 If  you take less than baseload quantity we buy this back at Katy GD low two 
days after flow.
 The two day after price is used in order to line up volumes with cash 
price.  I would find out on the day after flow of your excess take and then 
pay the next  days price to meet your needs, hence two days after.

3)  Term would be one year out of August 2000 with evergreen clause 
(automatically extends month ot month) with 30 day written notice of 
cancellation during evergreen term

Give me your input.

Thanks Again!

Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.

Hello,

Please prepare an HPL M/P per terms of the attached credit worksheet.  The 
timetable on this is immediate.  Please copy me with the draft by e-mail once 
the contract is prepared.



Also, please prepare an assignment document to move trades (NA0376 and 
NU2813) from Cannon Interests Houston to Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc.  
It should be noted within the assignment document that these trades are 
assumed under the Kinder M/P (yet to be entered into) and that it is these 
credit terms that should apply, not those of the original confirmation.


Everyone has agreed to be flexible on all this in order to wrap this up by 
Friday.  Thanks

Thanks
brant

 Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I 
talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in 
structuring the transaction in this manner.

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Dan Hyvl will call Gary Lamphier with the meter number.  This should go in 
the system as soon as we get the meter number form Dan Hyvl.  We can put this 
deal in the system before the contracts are signed, but we do not want to 
send the Osborn until we have a signed agreement  from ENTEX.   Also, do not 
pay Osborn until we recieve an allocation statement.

Thanks,

I wanted to let you know that we still do not have a deal in the system for 
Osborn.  Gary told Julie that the contract went back to legal and that he was 
waiting to hear from them before he did anything.  You can read Julie's email 
below.  Can you help with the particulars of the deal, especially the point?  
Gary is not sure.  The only detail I got from Osborn was that the price 
should be HSC - 0.20.  I would like to try and get their check out on Monday, 
if we can get the deal in today.

That is not right, even if it is A-, we still need credit langauge.  We do 
not need credit language if we are putting in a Master Sales Agreement.  I 
thought Stacy used the Master Firm Sales contract.

I will send up a credit worksheet for this counterparty.

We need to do a master purchase sale agreement because we would be buying  
back any quantities they obligated themselves to buy but failed to buy.  I 
did not know that we still used the single purpose sale agreement or that we 
had an approved form for such.  Do I understand you that since they are A-

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

That is the contract that I stated below isn't in Livelink.  I checked the 
File Room's database & they haven't ever received anything.  Therefore, the 
only thing that would exist would be the confirmation.  The TAGG or CPR Deal 
# is N23222.  With that number, Bob Bowen should be able to pull it for you.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.

Subject: New deals on HPL

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

Dan,

I have closed a transaction with Shell Oil with an end date of June 30, 2001.
Please reference O:/COMMON/LEGAL/DHYVL/DJH/CONTRACT/98003DCTR.DOC  and 
O:/COMMON/LEGAL/DHYVL/DJH/CONTRACT/98003ACTR.DOC

I have extended both agreements but the start dates are one month apart.

Changes to Contract Price:

1) Gas price is IF - HSC less (.01) 
2) same (excess priced at GD HSC Mid plus .04 two days after) Daily not 
monthly
3) Spot (buyback) Price is Gas Daily Katy Midpoint 2 days after  Daily not 
monthly

Volume 90,000 mmbtu/d for a year:
If volume is less than 32,850,000 mmbtu at year end, Shell will be billed .10 
per mmbtu less than 32,850,000

The first of the month  nominated volumes must range between 40,000 - 130,000 
per day and be nominated prior to bid week

See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be 
changed.  Also, keep an eye
out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure 
language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?)

Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dan,
At bottom of page is first run at contract.  Middle is changes to bottom.  
Top is summary.  Call if you have questions.

1)  50,000 a day firm @ Index  (.01)
2)    0-60,000  first of the month nomination must be received prior to the 
end of bid week (3 business days prior to end of month).
 Also priced @ Index (.01)
3) Swing:  First 20,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid +.04 two days after
     From 20,001 - 50,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid+ .10 two days after
4)Buyback:
 Any volumes flowing less than first of month nom will be bought back on a 
daily basis @ Katy Mid two days after.

Gary,

1. Backup swing - I can live with a two-tiered pricing structure for
no-notice backup swing service. Just for clarification the tiers and pricing
would be as follows:
 a) 0 - 20,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel, Midpoint,
two days after flow plus $0.04/MMBtu and,
 b) 20,001 - 50,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel,
Midpoint, two days after flow plus $0.10/MMBtu.

2. Firm Gas - The flexibility of the firm gas delivery is for plant
maintenance only. I can drop the maximum volume to 110,000 MMBtu/d but
that's it. Given our current maintenance schedule, the expected demand and
your nominated volume would be as follows:

  Month   Deer Park Demand  HPL
Nomination
  July 2000  207,000 MMBtu/d  105,000
MMBtu/d
  August  207,000   105,000
  September  207,000   105,000
  October  190,000    95,000
  November  210,000   110,000
  December  210,000   110,000
  January 2001 145,000    70,000
  February  165,000    80,000
  March   213,000   110,000
  April   108,000    50,000
  May   108,000    50,000
  June   213,000   110,000

If you do the math, the total HPL nomination volume is 33,485,000 MMBtu for
a daily average take of 91,700 MMBtu/d. The uncertainty is that the
maintenance schedule is dynamic and the above numbers are subject to
revision. That's why we need the flexibility.

3. Curtailment/Interruption - My expectation is that this is a firm gas
supply. If I need to curtail and/or interrupt, it would trigger the buyback
option and would count against my annual average. However, if you curtail
and/or interrupt the buyback option would not be trigged and my annual
average would be adjusted accordingly.

4. Nominations - your definition of bidweek is perfectly acceptable. Can I
make a nomination of 105,000 MMBtu/d today?

Yes that is correct.  When I spoke to the counterparty he mentioned wanting 
to be looked as their own Company.  Which is fine, since the entity is 
rated.  What these companies are doing is simply combining their 
petrochemical assests to become the largest company in that industry.  I 
tried telling Dan Hyvl that, but he didn't understand my viewpoint.  Yes 
their name is listed as an LP, but I really can't explain as to why it is.  I 
just told Dan to call them to get the entire Legal run-down from them.  We do 
need to execute a new Master though.

Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.

Julie,

Attached is a list of 89 HPL Resources Company contracts that were active in 
the Global Contracts database on 3/17/2001.  Please determine:

1.  Which contracts will be needed to continue business after the expected 
6/1/2001 sale of HPL to AEP.  

2.  Which contracts are no longer used and can be terminated immediately.

3.  Which contracts will be needed to conduct intercompany business until 
5/31/2001, but will no longer be needed after the expected 6/1/2001 sale of 
HPL to AEP.

If appropriate, we should attempt to have as many of the type 2 contracts (no 
longer used) terminated at the end of this month on 3/31/2001.

As most of you have probably heard already, I am leaving Enron to pursue some 
new endeavors.  I will be moving back home to Toronto and I'm going to take 
some time off to do some travelling.  I plan to go back to school in January, 
and after that.... we'll see what life has in store!  

I wanted to thank all of you for the many wonderful experiences I have had 
here at Enron.  It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know you 
all.  I hope that if you're ever in Toronto you will drop me a line.

My last day of work will be June 30th, however, I will be staying in Houston 
until the end of July.  I hope to see or speak to all of you before I leave, 
but if I don't manage to, please keep in touch.  My e-mail address is 
jennifer_sabine@yahoo.com.

Take care and good luck!
Jennifer

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus 
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into 
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Re; 0:/Legal?DHYVL/DJH/2001/Ltr/2001-005crfm.doc
I just did a deal with Panther and I would use the same contract with this 
additional language.

Period of Delivery: April 01, 2001 - March 31, 2002


add that either party can terminate with 30 days written notice
add evergreen language so the deal will roll after the one year term.


Thanks,
J


Is the commodity price at Katy tail gate or HSC?  It looks like the contract 
says both?

Per our discussion earlier today, here is some generic settlement language 
you might want to use:

In further consideration of the agreements, covenants and releases set forth 
herein, _____ hereby releases, acquits and discharges ___ and __________, 
together with their directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, 
representatives, heirs, assigns, affiliates, and subsidiary and parent 
organizations from and against any and all claims, demands, obligations, 
liabilities, for causes of action, of any nature whatsoever, at law or in 
equity, relating to or arising out of the subject matter of the Pending 
Litigation, including but not limited to, any and all claims, demands, 
liabilities or causes of action asserted in the Pending Litigation or arising 
under any contract or agreement, or in connection with any project, which is 
the subject of the Pending Litigation.

If no lawsuit has been filed, you will need to make some minor adjustments.  
I hope this helps.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Chevron Phillips- we have a Master Firm between HPL and Chevron Chemical - 
would it be OK (and easier) to get it assigned to the new entity?

BASF Corporation - ditto comment on Roche on preference for a Master Swap 
rather than an ISDA - they are at ground zero, and would find the ISDA 
intimidating

Air Products, Inc.-  no premium - flat to index 

Roche Vitamans- believe they are a strong (Swiss) credit 

Thanks

Lee,

Regarding these industrial:

Chevron Phillips- Veronica Espinoza an analyst here in the group had looked 
into them and can provide you the status on this, I think she was going to 
put a Master Firm Contract in place.
Is this with HPL?

BASF Corporation - I will follow up with this, the analyst who was looking 
into it, recently left Enton and provided me no insight into this.

Air Products, Inc.-  We do have a guaranty from Air Products and Chemicals 
for HPL, I presume this transaction will be with HPL.  What premium are you 
looking at?

Roche Vitamans- We have a file on this counterparty, although I am not 
familiar with them, either Veronica or myself will take a look and get back 
to you.

Thanks,
Russell

Russell:

Need to get an update on a couple of deals:

"Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP" - did you get the information that 
you needed??

"BASF Corporation"   -   I requested an ISDA a few weeks ago and have 
forgotten who was working on it - do you have an update??


PLUS a couple of new deals:

"Air Products, Incorporated" - a one year deal out of October for 3,000 
MMBtu/d, priced at Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel flat, guarantee from "Air 
Products and Chemicals, Inc."

"Roche Vitamins Inc." - I'd like to request a Master Swap for these guys - 
volumes would be small, less than 500 MMBtu/d, no more than one year term.  I 
really donlt want an ISDA - that would blow their mind, I'm really looking 
for the Enron Master Swap


Call me at 3.5923 when you're ready to discuss above

Thanks

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

We are finally nearing the end of the review. I am currently demanding a 
final response from our legal beagles on the indemnification issue since the 
two cannot come to an agreement so far.? As for the rest of the agreement, 
here are two changes that we discussed earlier on the phone:

ADD the following sentence at the end of the first paragraph in Enfolio 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement?? "This agreement and all other 
transactions are for sales of gas to the Engelhard Corporation Pasadena, 
Texas location only."

DELETE the second sentence that was added in the Daily Contract Quantity 
(DCQ) section on the Transaction agreement.?? (Seller acknowledges and agrees 
that the provisions of Section 3.4 of the ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement shall not apply so long as Buyer purchases the DCQ from Seller 
under the pricing terms provided below.)?? Our lawyers found this confusing.

I apologize for our late response.? 

Hope you had an enjoyable holiday.

Just wanted to thank everybody who works with Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Our former three year deal with them expired September 30.  Last week, we 
(finally) executed a new contract that keeps HPL as their largest natural gas 
supplier through September 30, 2002.  Also, when their volumes go up in early 
2001, they will once again be HPL's single largest industrial customer.

Everybody's hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off.  Although 
they can be very demanding to work with (particularly now that they are part 
of Exxon), they know that HPL provides them the best overall service.

Please pass on thanks to anyone I've left off the list who has worked with 
Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Have a great 2001.

Dan,
If  we have a full requirements contract with no minimums can they choose not 
to run their plant and therefore not take any gas?
South Hampton Refining has requested this for January.  Can you give me some 
feedback.

Thanks,
Gary

     Gary,

     I am pleased to accept the offer Mr. Stephen Schneider extended to us
     yesterday during our meeting in Baytown.

     We calculate the damages you offered to reimburse us for to be $27,749

     As we discussed, this is for repairing the actual damage done to the
     plant, and does not include any off spec or lost production issues.

     Please give me a call and we can discuss how you would like to handle
     the conclusion of this matter.

     Thank you for helping solve this issue.

     Best Regards,

     Bobby Combs

Re; 0:/Legal?DHYVL/DJH/2001/Ltr/2001-005crfm.doc
I just did a deal with Panther and I would use the same contract with this 
additional language.

Period of Delivery: April 01, 2001 - March 31, 2002


add that either party can terminate with 30 days written notice
add evergreen language so the deal will roll after the one year term.


Thanks,
J


Is the commodity price at Katy tail gate or HSC?  It looks like the contract 
says both?

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen

Dan,
Haldor Topsoe has requested a maximum volume of 1600 mmbtu per day and the 
new deal will replace the old deal at a new price of 110% IF-HSC for total 
requirements with an end date of 8/31/2004.  
FYI we are putting about $120,000 of facilities in to this location and it 
will have a new meter roughly 800 feet from the old one.  I am not sure at 
this time if we will read both meters or just one.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Thank you for making these changes so quickly.  I failed to ask you to
include one other item in the Transaction Agreement.  I would like to you to
specify that Rhodia does have trigger rights and that there are no minimum
volumes required to trigger.  Once you add that info and email the revised
Transaction Agreement back to my attention, I will be able to forward to
Rhodia.  Thank you for your assistance.  Once again, I apologize for
overlooking this item when we talked yesterday.

Susan

For what its worth (given that HPL is about to leave the Enron fold and I'll 
have to start all over with AEP's credit group!!), Roche would accept the GTC 
execpt the crucial part about collateral threshold and suggest the below 
language.

Comments??

Lee, 
We presently have approved the following paragraph in regards to hedging 
responsibility with another one of our natural gas suppliers with whom we 
lock in prices through Futures buying.? Would this paragraph be acceptable in 
lieu of your article 12 in HPL's Terms and Conditions?? 

Bill 

Financial Responsibility: In the event that in HPL's sole, but good faith, 
business judgment, exercised in a manner consistent with general commercial 
standards, HPL has reasonable grounds for insecurity of RVI's ability to 
perform its obligations under this Agreement, HPL may demand adequate 
assurance of performance from RVI.? Adequate assurance shall mean, but not be 
limited to, sufficient security in a form, for a term, and in an amount 
reasonably acceptable to HPL, including, but not limited to, a standby 
irrevocable letter of credit.? If RVI fails to deliver such adequate 
assurance within ten (10) business days following receipt of a written 
request by HPL, then RVI shall be considered to be in default of this 
Agreement. Similarly, in the event that in RVI's sole, but good faith, 
business judgment, exercised in a manner consistent with general commercial 
standards, RVI has reasonable grounds for insecurity of HPL's ability to 
perform its obligations under this Agreement, RVI may demand adequate 
assurance of performance from HPL.? Adequate assurance shall mean, but not be 
limited to, sufficient security in a form, for a term, and in an amount 
reasonably acceptable to RVI, including, but not limited to, a standby 
irrevocable letter of credit.? If HPL fails to deliver such adequate 
assurance within ten (10) business days following receipt of a written 
request by RVI, then HPL shall be considered to be in default of this 
Agreement.

Mr. Radigan 

We have developed the language that is required to be able to enter into a 
fixed price transaction for the Freeport Plant. 

Because our existing physical contract is an older format, it proved to be 
cumbersome to modify it.? Therefore, we would enter into a new agreement 
for the fixed price volume as follows: 

(See attached file: roche-gtc-2001-049crfm.doc) 

Any volumes over the fixed price volumes would continue to flow under the 
existing agreement.? The new contract would be the first volumes through 
the meter. 

Please call to dicsuss after you have had a chance to review.

Dan,
I need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with Intercontinental 
Terminals Company.
This company is located at 1943 Battleground Road, P.O. Box 698, Deer Park 
Texas 77536-0698.
My contact is Lynn Bingham (281) 884-0312. They have showed interest in doing 
a  fixed rate. That 
is why I would like for them to sign a Master contract at this time. That way 
when we agree on a price
we can act on it without having to wait on getting them approved. They passed 
along to me that they
are a sister company of Global Octane. Call me with any questions.

The document looks good. Can we use this as a template for further buyback 
confirmations ?

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
