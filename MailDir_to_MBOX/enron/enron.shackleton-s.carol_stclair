Caroline Abramo has initiated a new hedge fund family for financial trading.  
I am anticipating up to 4 separate masters, but likely only one series of 
negotiations (the others will likely duplicate the terms of the first one).  
The paper has started flow in.  Would you please advise which attorney will 
handle this?  The group is Wexford.  I need to start forwarding up to you 
copies of the offering memoranda.

Thanks.

Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I 
was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA 
Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify 
the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the 
parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.  
Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should 
consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume 
counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post 
cash collateral to us?

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral In Canada

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Elizabeth:
I had a question about a recurring provision that I have seen in your Power 
Contracts.  Looks like our credit group accepts a Guaranty from a 
Counterparty's Credit Support Provider as a form of Performance Assurance to 
satisfy any collateral posting requirements.  On the financial side, 
Guarantys always supplement the colateral requirements such that we require 
them to post cash or LC's to us even if we are holding a parent Guaranty.  
Why is there a different approach on the power side?  Alos, how does credit 
value a parent guaranty?  For example, if the parent's financial condition 
worsens, does the value of the Guaranty drop?  Let me know what you think.

Thanks for your prompt response.  I think that we do need to register the 
charge document which in this case would be the confirmation that will be 
executed. Can you provide me with an estimate of the total cost?

Does everyone at Enron agree?

Caroline,
I will redraft the Bermuda confirm to change from LC's to cash and send to 
you.  Please make sure that the counterparty is aware that we plan to 
register/file the confirm in Bermuda.

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of "perfecting" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Chris Garrod

collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The
agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call
either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can

cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any

Carol,
I've just returned to the office after 6 months away, and have discovered
that we have not finalized the ISDA documents with Enron, nor the Guaranty.
Attached is the file which you emailed to us last year - I'm not sure if
there is a more updated version, so perhaps you can confirm. Also, please
forward to me Enron's most recent version of Paragraph 13 to the Credit
Support Annex, as we have not reviewed that document.

On review of the attached file received from you on January 9, 2001, I
provide the following comments:

Part 3 - delivery of documents, the part requesting Commercial Risks (Party
B4s) annual financial statements looks like it needs some clarification. It
appears that Enron wants to receive quarterly financials, however we only
publish annual statements as a privately held company.

Part 5 - Representations - line of business should be removed for Party B.

The Guaranty language looks fine with the amendments, so I would suggest
that be issued and we can check it off our "to do" lists.

When we have signed the ISDA Master Agreement and supporting Documents, I
will have our General Counsel submit all of the documentation to our Legal
Counsel for issuance of the Legal Opinion. I do not foresee any problems in
having this issued in a timely fashion.

When the minor amendments referenced above have been made, please forward a
final, clean draft of the documents to my attention so we can do a final
review and issue the documents for signatures.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
With kind regards,
Laurie Orchard

In the unlikely event taht you are called tomorrow and they can't reach me 
here is where things stand.  After several internal discussions with Paul, 
Akasha and Denis O'Connell and based on the information that we have received 
from DB thus far, it appears as if our Reference Entity's subsidiaries have 
declared a standstill/moratorium with respect to all of their debt.  Our 
Reference Entity is the Guarantor of such debt.  We have taken the position 
that since the Credit Event must occur with respect to our Reference Entity, 
we need proof that our Reference Entity has repudiated its obligations under 
its Guaranty.  We feel fairly certain that it has, but DB has not shown us 
any proof of this.  Paul is calling the paying agent on the defaulted bonds 
to try and find out and we have sent another e-mail to DB requesting proof.

All of the other requirements have been met with respect to the obligations 
that DB plans to deliver to us next week to settle the contract.  I just need 
to quickly review the Guaranty that supports such obligations to make sure 
that it is unconditional.  I expect to see it sometime today.

Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash 
collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an 
"instrument" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property 
Security Act, and an "instrument" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties 
were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could 
rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate 
further?  Peter.

Akasha:
I would reword the first sentence as follows:

In response to your e-mail dated March 21st and based on all of the 
information that we have received from you thus far which essentially has 
only demonstrated that the debt of our Reference Entity's affiliates has been 
repudiated, we still lack proof of the repudiation by our Reference Entity 
(and the guarantor of such debt) of its obligations under the Guaranty that 
supports such debt.  Please provide us such information to demonstrate that a 
Credit Event has occurred.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but will be checking my voice mail.  If 
you need to consult with someone right away, please contact Sara Shackleton 
who is familiar with this deal.

Carol, can you check the note below.
Thanks
Akasha


In response to your email dated March 21st, you have not proven whereby the 
guarantor( ie. the reference entity) has repudiated its obligations under the 
guarantee for the obligations mentioned in the documents sent to us, in your 
notice of Publicly Available Information..

We are still awaiting a copy of the Prospectus for the ISIN XS0109296011 
US$22.4MM floating rate notes due 2000 and a copy of the guarantee.  Again, 
we do not believe a Credit Event has yet ocurred.

Carol,

I'm assuming we'd have to do this all over again once we have an ISDA (I
guess we register the credit support annex?)...  Does this process
compromise any confidential information?

Mary, Sara and Brent:
Mark H. has asked me to join Elizabeth's group which I have agreed to do 
while I continue to support Julia's group on the physical trading side.  I 
plan to meet with Mark T. later this week to go over what files I will keep 
and what files I will not keep.  My tentative plan is to finish all of the 
day to day stuff and to hand over most of the special projects/ longer term 
stuff.  With that in mind, please give some thought about who should handle 
the hedge fund work, Canada back-up, the KCS VPP, coordinating our offsite 
and the remaining legal/credit conferences, negotiating the Japan ISDA's (I 
have created the forms and drafts of Schedules have been sent out), point 
person for EIM financial trading issues, and credit derivatives back-up and 
let me know what you think.

On the offsite, Frank has a doctor's appt. that afternoon and asked that we 
reschedule.  Should we have it in the morning of the 24th or reschedule our 
23rd c credit seminar?  As for a list, I'm working on it.  Last week was a

Sure.  I think we should ask Paul R. if anyone else from credit is necessary 
(London, perhaps?) and from legal, you, Brent and me.

Also, we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set.  I will be 
on vacation during the week of May 7 - 11.  Were you able to put a list 
together?

Joe and Kim:
Sara and  I met with Tanya yesterday and one of the topics that we discussed 
was making sure that someone was tracking whether our counterparties were 
signing Omnibus Confirms that had credit terms (i.e. Annex B and B-1).  Can 
you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this 
type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, 
the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the 
counterparty and/or other creditors is if we can demonstrate that our 
counterparty entered into a valid security agreement with us.  I look forward 
to hearing from you.

I am not sure it solves matters.  Stikemans opinion points out:

1.  as I indicated this morning, "money" means actual currency - notes and 
coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be 
treated as an "intangible" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I 
pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration;

2.  although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be 
recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the 
Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the 
Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk 
that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security 
interest subject to the requirements for perfection.

With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law, 
and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely 
on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume 
counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

Peter.

Peter:
Thanks for responding and sorry about you having to repeat this again as I 
was not aware of your previous discussions.  In Stikeman's November 2000 ISDA 
Collateral Opinion, they suggest as an alternative course of action to modify 
the Credit Support Annex to create a debtor/creditor relationship between the 
parties and to provide for an outright transfer of cash instead of a pledge.  
Do you have any thoughts on this?  Is this an alternative that we should 
consider implementing with some of our more persistent high volume 
counterparties who are giving us a hard time about not being able to post 
cash collateral to us?

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral In Canada

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

For your review, I've attached the adjustments our legal department is
proposing to the Consent to Assignment since receiving your red-lined
version from Rhonda Denton.  As to the transfer effective date, since we are
now into June, we would expect the transfer date to be as of July 1st.
Please let me know as soon as possible your comments on MEGA's most recent
proposed Consent to Assignment (attached below).

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the 
transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are 
Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and were 
supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit.  
Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are 
Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after this 
review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked.  

Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading for 
Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not continue 
to have these questions when our settlements people try to check out at month 
end.  Thanks for your help.

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of "perfecting" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need 
an original (or a certified true copy) of the executed document which creates 
the security interest.  There is no time limit on such registration.  
However, please note that, in addition to our professional fees, there is a 
filing fee of $446 which is payable in respect of the registration.

I trust that the above is of some assistance.  If you have any questions 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement.  
Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via 
email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are 
negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate 
this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement 
until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need 
to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that 
establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of 
Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes 
it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

Elizabeth, 
Per my voice mail here is what credit wants to explore.  If we have an ISDA 
in place with a non-regulated affiliate of a utility, they want to create 
some credit triggers that would be based on events that occur with respect to 
our counterparty's regulated utility affiliate.  Can this be done?  Could we, 
for example, have a drop in the credit rating of the utility trigger a MAC?  
Could we cross default to the utility's physical and/or financial 
transactions?  I know that there are limitations on what can be done, I just 
didn't know how extensive they were.

Just a few additional thoughts on this list as possible topics:

1.  credit event upon merger - seems like more counterparties want to define 
the "materially weaker" standard.  Alos, I'm wondering how credit monitors 
mergers in general.

2.  additional termination events - when does credit consider additional 
events like change of control, MAC, chnages to partnership agreement or 
structure etc.

3.  minimum transfer amount - how it works and how it is different from the 
threshold

4.  threshold amount - what triggers makes it reduce to zero

5.  enforcement of collateral remedies - going over the timetable for 
enforcing our remedies when a counterparty fails to post and the different 
cure periods.

6.  letter of credit bank qualifications - confirming with credit that these 
are still current

7.  cash collateral in Canada

The offsite list is still on my list of things to do.  On Montana Power, no 
draft has been sent.  Please touch base with Tanya as my recollection was 
that she had a credit issue that needed to be addressed in the draft.  On the 
swaption, the Exercise date is 6/29 and the confirm requires oral or written 
notice of its  intent to enter into the transaction, followed up with written 
confirmation of notice of exercise.  Is there anything that we can or should 
do ahead of time?

Have you had a chance to recap our "offsite" discussion?

Also, what can you tell me about Montana Power Company (1st draft ISDA)?

Stop by in the a.m regarding exercise of your swaption.  What does your 
confirm say about the form of notice of exercise and the exercise date (or 
period)?

FYI note from Mary Cook.  Althought the ISDA would not need to be amended, 
ecah individual confirm would have to be amended from our normal procedure.  
It also seems that the convention of settling financials on the fifth BD 
after determination is something that has developed after much consideration.

You would not need to amend the ISDA.  Payment Dates are stated in the 
confirmations.  Regarding your item 4, you might wish to talk to Sara 
concerning the history of the payment date as 5th after determinable.  The 
issue has been discussed often over the years between settlements and 
treasury.  Mary

		 Subject: Premstar Energy Canada Ltd. - Financial Transaction Nos. QF3405.1, 
QG7130.1, NY2665.1 and NY5271.1

Premstar Energy Canada has requested that the Payment Dates for the above 
noted financial transactions be amended to conform with physical settlement 
from "The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating 
Price is determinable" to "The twenty fifth (25th) day of the month following 
each Determination Period.  Should the Payment Date fall on a weekend or 
statutory holiday, payment shall be made on the next Business Day.".

My comments are as follows:

1. Russell, kindly confirm that there is no credit concern with extending the 
financial payment cycle;

2. Laura/Cheryl, kindly confirm that it is something that we have done in the 
past for financial transactions;

3. Melinda, assuming that Russell, Laura/Cheryl do not have concerns, please 
prepare an amendment to each of the Confirmation Letters as requested by 
Premstar, except that the final sentence of their requested amendment should 
read:  "Should the Payment Date fall on a Saturday or statutory holiday other 
than a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately preceding 
Business Day, and if the Payment Date is a Sunday or statutory holiday 
falling on a Monday, then payment shall be made on the immediately following 
Business Day.".  This will make the Payment Dates consistent with physical 
gas settlement.

4. Melinda, if this amendment is not approved by Russell, Laura or Cheryl, I 
think that an amendment is nonetheless necessary to the Payment Date, as it 
is not the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating 
Price is determinable, but rather the fifth (5th) Business Day of the month 
following each Determination Period.

5. If possible, Premstar would like the amendment to be effective for the 
February, 2001 Determination Period.

6. Premstar would also like this provision to extend to any and all future 
Financial Swap transactions done with them.  Mary, is there any amendment 
required to the ISDA to effect such a permanent amendment, or is this a 
matter that can be dealt with in each subsequent confirmation letter?


Regards,
Peter

Mark:
I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent 
unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., 
legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are 
held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to 
come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the 
legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about 
this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not 
learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I 
alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and 
not an individual.  Thanks.

Akasha:
As we discussed, the following are my questions:

1. We need some verification that the debt that is referred to in the 
articles is the debt of Asia Pulp & Paper Co. Ltd. ("Asia Ltd."), the entity 
referred to in the Confirm and that the amount that is the subject of the 
standstill is at least 10 million.

2. We need to confirm that the debt that is the subject of the standstill 
meets the following characteristics:

 - it is a bond or a loan 
- it ranks pari passu with other senior, unsecured debt of Asia Ltd.
 - it is not payable in the currency of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized
 - it is not governed by the law of the place where Asia Ltd. is organized

Mr. Giordano:
At Caroline Abramo's request, I am sending you the confirms for the 14 
transactions that ENA has done with ENA.  Each of these confirms is the same 
for each of the 2 Catequil entities except for the specific terms which are 
set forth on the first few pages.  The last 2 documents that I have attached 
are the templates that we used to create each confirm.  If you have any 
questions, please call Caroline Abramo.  Thank you.

Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it 
something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt 
the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's 
primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by 
possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that 
we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze 
let's talk first.  Thanks.

One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Christopher:
We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated collateral 
provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The agreement will be 
governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your advice on how to 
perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we would hold in an 
account in the United States.  Could you please call either me or Sara 
Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can send me an e-mail if 
that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the cash is enough.  Sorry 
for the short fuse on this.  If you need any additional information, please 
contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston 
time.

with a Mexican counterparty.  Are there any limitations that I should be

I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are 
objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion.  
If we need to recommend Bermuda counsel to them we can.  On the credit side, 
for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP they want to increase the cross default 
threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000.  Paul, are you okay with this?  I am

I have reviewed Tanya's list and of the ones that she told us to pursue, it 
appears as if from our Lotus Notes entries that we are in fact  in the 
process of getting ISDA's put in place.  That leaves us with Fred's customers 
(other than Cross Timbers which we are getting an ISDA in place).  Any 
thoughts on how we should proceed?  Should we focus on the remaining 
counterparties on Joe's list or others?  Please advise.

Carol:

Regarding a "hedge fund meeting" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you 
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming "process" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be "last minute" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

Carol,
Hope you had an enjoyable retreat in San Antonio. While you were away I spoke 
to a guy named Jeff Kauhl, who is handling trade confirmations for DKR (the 
energy fund of AIG). He had some questions about confirms that we sent him 
for a fuel oil crack spread trade done in April. I directed him to you, and 
asked him to call you on Monday. 
You can call me in NYC (212 702 3914) if you have any questions. Jeff's 
number is 203 324 8480. 
Regards,
Russ

Caroline:
I have received and reviewed their comments.  On the legal front, they are 
objecting to the Bermuda law opinion.  We cannot do this without an opinion.  
If we need to recommend Bermuda counsel to them we can.  On the credit side, 
for AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP they want to increase the cross default 
threshold from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000.  Paul, are you okay with this?  I am 
okay with their other comments.

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?
