Here is the memo we discussed this morning, wherein I reiterated to the PSCo 
project team the "must have" language that Lisa Bills said she needed for 
equipment orders into West LB.  She has subsequently told us that E-Next 
requires the same approach.

Subject: FVP Purchase Orders

The following is the "must have" language for the equipment purchase orders:
1) No reference to NEPCo.  The deal will be between the vendor as seller, and 
ENA as agent for West LB as buyer.  There will be no reference to an 
"Owner".  
2) The buyer's obligations must be limited to payment of a set price.  
Cancellation rights are acceptable, but the payment exposure must be set out.
3) We require termination rights.  Again, it is acceptable that such 
termination right be coupled with cancellation payments.
4) Assignment provision: must provide that buyer can assign to a "successor 
financing entity". 

This is the feed back we have been waiting for, and is the result of the 
conversations and e-mails we have been engaged in with Rose and Lisa 
recently.  There is one additional point, as you are aware:  NEPCo and EE&CC 
need to get the purchase orders and option attachment material to us (i.e. 
the deal team, and ENA legal) for scrubbing before it goes to Lisa and Rose.  
They can review the material for compatibility with West LB and TurboPark 
requirements, but not for commercial workability.  

I may miss your phone call this afternoon, if it comes off, as I am headed to 
the airport.  This info should be imparted to NEPCo and EE&CC.

I have made changes for "97-10" compliance to the last draft I have of 
Karen's redline.   The gist of the changes is that the Owner is a beneficiary 
under the contract, but has minimal obligations thereunder.   The 
Construction Manager has most of the obligations, but cannot provide the 
indemnification EECC is used to seeing from their counterparty.  

Lisa - there may be spots where you do or do not want the Owner mentioned - I 
tried to limit it to when the Owner was a beneficiary, but that may strain 
some of the legal relationships - we may need to change a few of the 
references.   Accounting may have some objections to the way some things are 
phrased also.

I think we can get there with EECC, but it will take some work.  John is 
getting back to me as to his availability for a meeting Tues. or Wed.

Rose

it has been blessed by the accountants but it won't be official until the 
TurboPark documents are all signed and sealed, a process that is underway.

Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000 
turbine contract as it was moved into TurboPark.  This letter highlights the 
97-10 and lender requirements.  I hope you find it useful.






This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog 
equipment.  This shows one approach to assignment under TurboPark.  This is 
also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for 
assignment:

I forgot to add that the override letter needs 30.7 - Third Party Beneficiary 
language also.  Rob, would you put that in from the current Turbine Purchase 
Agreement?

Thanks,

Mike hasn't sent the new assignment language. To my knowledge we had not 
discussed including it in this set of agreements, so he may have put it aside 
to work on the consent issues.

Subject: Override Letter

See attached for our changes.  I am typing the Annex IV stuff now  - it has 
to do with Sections 26.4 and 26.5 - resolution of certain Purchaser-Agent 
Disputes.  We also will need to put in the currently-being-negotiated 
assignment language, so the bank knows that they have access to their 
collateral.


Barnas said he was drafting that after the last version Kay drafted.  I have 
not seen it yet.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay, I have told Rob that we are not pushing GE for this point.  WestLB is 
plenty protected without it.  If GE gives a yes to the change on Monday - 
Great!  If no answer or answer is no - we take what we have.  Therefore, 
please log  call into GE on Monday am and let them know we need an answer on 
Monday and would appreciate if they would accomodate us.

I have never seen the language requested before and have not signed off on 
it.  Rob Taylor and I only discussed the concept because I had never seen a 
draft of the Consent until a signed copy was delivered to me yesterday.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 12/14/00 08:47AM >>>

This language is different that what GE was told was requested before.  I
am more comfortable going back to GE with what was requested previously.

I have attached the ESA GE Consent as conformed per our discussions last week 
on the ENA deal, and because the "break-out" contracts are still in draft 
form.  I This is the version we will be delivering at the closing.

Kay - I will let you know when we fund.

Subject: E-Next Gen/Purchase of Property




Lisa - The notice under 6.1(a) of the DCMA for Property to be purchased out 
of the facility should specify simply: 

1.????? The proposed Applicable Construction Purchase Date (between 5 and 15 
Business Days after the date of the notice).? By my count we don't have 5 BDs 
left in the year.? If you want to do by year end you will need a waiver.

2.????? The Specified Option Property - which should be described with 
sufficient specificity for the Developer to prepare a legally sufficient 
quitclaim deed or bill of sale and assignment pursuant to 7.1 of the DCMA, 
and the party owning the property (Developer or Developer Subsidiary or 
other).? For your purposes now, this should be fairly straightforward - we 
will be doing just a Bill of Sale and an assignment.? Serial numbers, 
location and any other information for positive identification of any 
equipment should suffice, and as to contract rights that is just a reference 
to the appropriate contract(s) and the rights to be assigned thereunder (if 
not all).? In future, this element will be driven by the type of Property you 
are taking out. 

3.????? Designate the amount of Project Costs Attributable to the Specified 
Option Property.? Note that this works hand in hand with the voluntary 
prepayment section under the PA, Section 2.1G for Phase I.? I assume you're 
in LIBOR right now, so you need to give a minimum 3 B.D. notice of 
prepayment, and it is irrevocable. You might as well incorporate the notice 
of prepayment into the Purchase Option Exercise Notice.

The Developer will need to produce and deliver a Bill of Sale and an 
assignment based on the information you provide, so please copy me on the 
information you send to CSFB.? 

I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Jon (generally or about 
the waiver issue) or anyone else, so please go ahead and start on the notice 
with the knowledge that there may be further comment and a requirement for 
further information.? Why don't you produce one version that includes a 
request for a waiver of the 5 Business Day requirement and an "acknowledged 
and consented to" signature line for CSFB as Admin Agent.? As you suggested 
on the phone, it may be worthwhile to produce a form for this kind of 
notice.? Let's consider doing that after the first of the year so we can be 
sure to anticipate all that must be included. There may be other items we 
want to establish a form or precedent for too, depending on what features of 
the facility you see Enron using frequently. 

Let's speak about this early today, obviously. And we must be sure we have 
enough Business Days left in the year to pull this off - LIBOR Business Days 
would be the only problem I could imagine, I'm just unable to check that 
right now.

Talk to you soon, I'll be in the office by 9 or 9:30.? And why did it take 
you so long to get active on this facility? Such a nice credit and you just 
let it sit there for days! 

Cheers, Karl

I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.

Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.

 

Please advise if you have any comments.

Subject: Re: Ft. Pierce -- HRSG Option Agreement  

I agree we need more discussion. However, re the " need to skate around lease 
issues in whatever docs are created now", remember the only document we 
propose to sign in the near future is the HRSG option and the only payment we 
propose to make is the option premium to secure the delivery date. I don't 
see the need to worry about the lease issues in the other draft documents we 
create now to try to gain agreement in principle to the basic commercial 
terms of the deal. The other documents will never be signed without necessary 
97-10 compliant provisions unless we opt to flip the project to a third party 
concurrently with their execution. If we don't opt to flip to a third party, 
we will revise the documents before their execution to address the lease 
issues. By your response, are you implying that the simple creation of these 
other draft documents and our discussion of the commercial terms therein with 
our counterparty gives rise to on-balance sheet concerns irrespective of what 
we actually sign?

We need to discuss these issues in more detail tomorrow during the 10 am 
presentation.  We need to be careful to skate around lease issues involving 
97-10 in whatever docs are created now because we could end up in a lease 
model in the future.  Anything we create now and should have to live with may 
hurt us in the future if in a lease.

Subject: Re: Ft. Pierce -- HRSG Option Agreement  

The option of equipment  is the same method used to secure firm delivery 
dates in the ABB transformer financing, which was ultimately rolled into a 
West LB structure. As I understand it, in a 97-10 context, option premium is 
not a hard cost and hence does not give rise to on-balance sheet concerns so 
long as total project soft costs of which the premium is a part do not exceed 
10% of aggregate project cost. Here, to keep the deal off-balance sheet we 
are looking to either (i) a TECO or other third party investor take out ( by 
purchase of the project entity membership interests concurrently with the 
project entity's execution of definitive project agreements ) or (ii) a West 
LB lease structure. Even though we are not drafting the project documents to 
incorporate a West LB structure at this time, we need to maintain flexibility 
to revise the documents to reflect a West LB structure if a third party deal 
does not materialize or if we determine a West LB structure would be more 
beneficial and West LB would agree to the takeout.The principal constraint 
imposed by maintaining this flexibility is that all of our expenditures under 
the HRSG contract until the take out is firmed up must be able to be 
characterized as option premium/soft cost and must not - when aggregated with 
other project soft costs - exceed 10% of total project costs. 

We have opted not to draft all of the project documents on a West LB model 
now because it has been determined ( subsequent to the draft of the HRSG 
contract on a West LB model) that as a practical matter incorporation of this 
approach into all the project agreements  will impede our ability to reach 
commercial agreement with FPUA. If we fail to reach commercial agreement, the 
off-balance sheet concerns are all academic. Put another way, we think that 
if we can reach commercial agreement first, it will be easier to revise the 
documents later to incorporate a West LB structure ( if we decide to go that 
route ) because it will be easier for FPUA to conceptualize the changes 
imposed by our financing requirements after the principal commercial issues 
are solved. The same rationale applies to the HRSG vendor. I know this 
requires a change to the HRSG draft to eliminate the West LB structure 
currently reflected therein, but if we opt for the third party takeout, the 
West LB approach currently reflected in the HRSG contract would have to be 
deleted anyway.
I
As soon as it is drafted, we need to run the HRSG option by Herman Manis to 
ensure that our approach does not jeopardize our ability to use the West LB 
alternative later or otherwise have adverse accounting treatment. I 
understand the off-balance sheet treatment is in part a function of our 
intent at the time we enter into project agreements, and to my knowledge the 
option has never been used where a third party takeout or lease takeout are 
being considered as alternative off-balance sheet approaches at the time a 
project document is signed. It seems to me, however, that the bare execution 
of the HRSG option where the ultimate takeout mechanic is uncertain and no 
definitive project agreements have been signed does not foreclose our ability 
to later opt for a West LB takeout or otherwise result in the project having 
to be taken on balance sheet if a third party takeout does not materialize.

By copy hereof, I'm requesting Herman share with us his thoughts on our 
proposed approach to the Ft. Pierce project.

FYI, as indicated previously, Bart Clark/ENA recommends an option approach 
for purchase of HRSG and has lead in developing agreement. Previous ABB 
option agreement (attached/below) may be used as starting point.

Bart, there is a question as to whether the option approach will satisfy off 
balance sheet requirements. Please advise.

Bart,

Initial heat balance part of HRSG RFP went out today -- balance hopefully 
will go out later this week. 

Reason for 10/18 target date on draft HRSG option? ... I suggest that we need 
to provide this to bidders as early as possible in the process to avoid "late 
in the game" surprises and potential delays in getting HRSG commitment. 

Let's discuss as appropriate -- Darrell

FYI, I will see about revising the ABB option for the Fort Pierce deal as 
soon as I finish some other matters ( including the Interface EPC for Ft. 
Pierce ) that are also in line. Once revised, the option will need to go to 
accounting for review and approval. I understood the draft HRSG contract went 
out last week. What is the driver on the requested 10/18 date for completion 
of the HRSG option?

Hi Bart,

I think this is at least close to the final draft. It ain't pretty but it 
seemed to work.  You won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions, so 
long as I get a copy of the new-and-improved version.

Ok Team, we are in the last throws of documentation of financing documents!  
They will be done by noon.  If anyone has comments, they need to be in before 
that.  I also want to receive written confirmation from Accounting, Tax, ENA 
Legal, EGF Legal that they have signed off on the documents.   The only 
document left outstanding which the legal team is busily working on for 
completion [today hopefully?] is the EPC Contract.

Starting on Monday, the legal team needs to begin the closing due diligence 
process.  Given that we thought we had a great call with GE this week and got 
at least S&S's signoff on consent letter, we haven't heard from anyone.  This 
is UNACCEPTABLE since it puts not just TurboPark but all the deals relying on 
TurboPark in jeopardy!

I will arrange a meeting on Monday to walk through the closing checklist with 
the legal team to insure that everything can be completed by December 13th.

CLOSING WILL OCCUR ON DECEMBER 15TH!

Happy Holidays,
Lisa

show all revisions to the EECC form EPC contract.

Please note that the comparison document, prepared by DeltaView, shows new 
text in blue double underscore, deleted text in red strikethrough, and moved 
text in green (double underscore at the new location, strikethrough from 
where moved).

Karen Jones at Enron in Portland drafted the attached.   We wanted your 
review and comments, especially with respect to how we treat the concept of 
the "merger" of the Agent and Purchaser in the agreements once they are out 
of the Enron financing vehicle. The same considerations apply to what is 
commonly known as the "Blue Dog" turbine, also.

Mike - this is what I left the voice mail about yesterday.  Let me know if 
you'll have a chance to talk later today.  Steve is in Houston at Enron 
today, so we can get him on the call, also.


Thanks so much,

Rose

Kay,  Attached is the TECO contract and the blank form of EPC and Exhibits I
believe ENA has used in the past.  None have stood the test of financing (at
least since NEPCO has been doing ENA work).

Karen Jones called me on the same subject so I am emailing her a copy as
well.  I'm flexible in regard to making these documents more compatible with
lender requirements.  Let me know if I can help.

Lisa and I reviewed the captioned for purchase by  E-NEXT GENERATION LLC, 
which is the special purpose vehicle established to finance North American 
power project asset acquisition and development.   Most of these comments 
have general applicablity to all equipment or service contracts destined for 
the facility, so you can use these as a starting point for future purchase 
contract drafting.   For that reason I have also cc'd Kay and Sheila.


1. The Purchaser should be E-NEXT GENERATION LLC and its Affiliates, 
successors and assigns - the address should be c/o Wilmington Trust Company, 
Rodney Square North, 1100 Market Street, Wilmington DE  19890-0001.  
Attention: Corporate Trust Adminstration.    Maybe the place to include the 
expanded definition of Purchaser is in Section 1.80. The reason we should 
include Affiliates, successors and assigns is because of the need to get the 
equipment into the project company if the project enters "Phase II" under the 
finance documents.  Generally a project will be in "Phase II" 
contemporaneously with the signing of the EPC contract. 

2. Agent's address is 1400 Smith, Houston, Tx.

3. Section 1.16 - I think the concept of the "Combined Contract Price" is 
probably not needed - haven't you decided that the Services Contract will not 
be financed through E-NEXT GENERATION ?

4. Delivery Points -- Tax should confirm that there are no adverse tax 
consequences to taking delivery of equipment imported from Belgium, whether 
DDU or DDP.

5. The definitions of "Facility" (Section 1.31)  and "Site" (Section 1.92) 
should  work so that the bank does not get a lien on the King Plant or its 
land.  Maybe we could have two definitions for each - one with respect to the 
technical requirements of the equipment and one we use for the "repowering" 
assets only.

6. There should be no "Owner" in the contract.  Generally, the word 
"Purchaser" should replace "Owner."   This change should not be made 
globally, because sometimes the word occurs with "Purchaser" - see definition 
of "Vendor."  In most of those cases, "Agent" should be added when "Owner" 
is  removed.

7. For the Transportation Deduct Option - Section 1.116 - the tax department 
should pass on whether title passing on delivery outside the U.S. will cause 
adverse tax consequences.  Ditto Section 3.2.2 - "Delivery to Optional 
Delivery Point."

8. Article II should be titled "Responsibilities of Purchaser and Agent" - 
ditto in the title to 2.1.  In (f) through (i) of 2.1, should add "or Agent" 
after "Purchaser."  Although the Section 23 "Relationship of the Parties" 
provision sets forth the agency relationship between the Purchaser and Agent, 
it can't hurt to clarify it here, too.

9. Remove Section 2.2.  Assignment provisions will be in Article XXII.  

10. Section 3.8 (c)(4) uses "Indemnify" as a defined term - didn't see a 
definition; Section 3.9 uses the defined term "Work," which I did not find, 
either (may be comprehended in "Scope of Work").

11. In Article IV - the Representation and Warranties should come from the 
Agent, if possible, and not from the Purchaser.  

12. For cancellation charges in Section 5.3 - should include a schedule in 
Exhibit I with firm $$ amounts.  Also - what is PNTP in the context of PNTP 
+1 month? 

13. In Section 5.4.4  are the "adjustments" are contemplated on a suspension 
recission negotiated before the recission is effective?

14. In Section 6.1.3  if we are requiring an L/C from them on NTP, probably 
should have a credit quality requirement.  Let's discuss.   Also in the 
second to last sentence of that section, need to insert "by" before "the 
reduction" and replace the "of" after "reduction" with "in."

15. In Section 6.4.3., there is a proviso that the Seller pays the Take Over 
LDs if Seller does not dispute the amount.   If the amount is disputed, does 
it move to arbitration?  Should they pay them and then dispute amounts per 
Section 26.3?    Ditto 6.4.4.

16. Section 6.7.2 - Address should be for ENA as Agent for E-NEXT GENERATION 
LLC, 1400 Smith, Houston, 77002.

17. Is a Preliminary Notice to Proceed required?  See Section 7.2.3.

18. The Quality plan in Section 9.3 discusses "ISO 9001, 1994" and any 
conflict between the two.  Are there some words missing?

19. Article XX is great - no Purchaser indemnities!!

20. Article XXII - Assignment - see attached.  This form was highly 
negotiated with GE - no other vendor has seen it.   For the special purpose 
entity structure, we need at least to have the ability of the Lenders to 
"foreclose" on the units.  Section 22.2(z) contemplates the transfer of a 
project of which the subject units are a part.  There is a credit quality 
rating of BBB- requirement as well as others.  I recommend we use the 
attached as a template to discuss internally what your counterparty would 
take - to make it as easy as possible to sell the project.  I would not offer 
it up as-is - it is a starting point to talk to them about what they need.

21. In Section 25.1 - Notices - Add ENA as Agent - ditto 25.3.


Bart - thanks so much for your help.    Give me a call to discuss.

Kay:

We have enclosed the most recent drafts of the following "prototype"
documents:

1.  Letter Agreement for the turbine transaction;
2.  Letter Agreement for the transformer transaction
3.  Limited Liability Company Agreement fur the turbine/transformer
transaction.

These documents were last revised on 12/15/2000.  Since that time, we made a
number of changes to the letter agreement in the InterGen transaction that
you might also wish to consider for the prototype.  These items include (i)
provisions for submission and approval of the facility agreement, (ii)
requirement that the entire purchase price be funded into escrow upon
approval of the facility agreement, (iii) pro-ration of property taxes, (iv)
requirement for liability insurance through date of commercial operation,
and (v) tweaks in the termination language that would provide a right to
terminate, rather than automatic termination.  Let me know if we can be of
any assistance.  Thank you.

Current negotiations with AALLP has provided us " a new look " at the current 
lease model.  It has loosened up somewhat to our benefit.  AALLP has agreed 
to a "two bucket" approach as indicated on the attached matrix.  Note that we 
may operate under this model until the EITF provides definitive guidance 
which is expected in December 2001.  

We should now focus on the O&M aspect of an existing or development project.  

If we pass bucket one as it relates to O&M and offtake limits of 95% or less, 
we will not be in a lease and do not proceed to bucket 2.  Bucket two is 
essentially where we have been up to now.  

In a nutshell, if Enron does not operate, does not have the ability to hire 
and fire the operator (must have less than 50% voting on this), does not set 
or approve operating policies and procedures and takes 95% or less of the 
offtake, we should not be in a lease and we stop there.  If we supply the 
fuel and take 95% or less of the offtake and pass O&M criteria, the fuel 
supply agreement must have significant LD's.  See specifics for Bucket 1 on 
the attached.

NOTE:  Please keep us in the loop on new deals as we roll out this new 
model.  We still need to scrub the deals in order to keep AALLP informed.




Please distribute to those I have missed.

		 Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

FYI, attached are the forms of design and engineering contracts for the 
Ft.Pierce project. The Technical Design Services Agreement will be cloned - 
one for the Facility improvements and one for the King Plant improvements, 
and the Black & Veatch agreement relates to design of the transmission 
upgrades. The two Technical Design Services Agreements ( with Stone and 
Webster ) will be amended and restated to be full blown Turbo Park compliant 
EPC contracts ( covering procurement and construction, as well as design ) 
with Stone and Webster ( assuming its estimate and delivery date are 
acceptable), at the time the project goes into Turbo Park. 

The Black & Veatch agreement will not be bifurcated, as Black & Veatch will 
not be the EPC contractor, but we will expect the EPC contractor for the 
transmission improvements to warrant the work. One issue we have is how to 
get Black & Veatch to give a Turbo Park compliant transmission improvements 
design warranty, but we may be able to get the EPC contractor to warrant the 
design and the improvements ( Turbo Park did not raise this issue, but it may 
in the future, so we need to be thinking about that ). The Black & Veatch 
agreement also may be assigned to FPUA, along with the transmission upgrades 
EPC contract, as FPUA will own the transmission improvements and supervise 
their construction. 

The reason for bifurcating the agreements is to allow work on "soft cost" 
items to proceed now - as required to keep the project on schedule - until we 
can close the deal with FPUA/FMPA and get into Turbo Park, where the "hard 
cost" procurement and construction expenditures can be made without putting 
the project on balance sheet. 

I'll forward the form Turbo Park EPC Contract under separate cover. Sorry 
about the late deliveries, but maybe you will be able to pick these up in the 
am.

		 Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

Attached are Turbo Park and accounting "approved" forms of the Technical 
Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the 
Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & 
Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the 
business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA 
underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and 
the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in 
the TDSA ), and not the "improvements" ( which term was included in the draft 
Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will 
need to "clone" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to 
deal with such "improvements" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these 
are the King Plant improvements).

The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front 
of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and 
restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will 
be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its 
interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would 
be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the 
FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of 
Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other 
development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently 
transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost 
expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by 
Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park.

The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with 
FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is 
negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms 
that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement 
because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may 
want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be 
comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the 
transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the 
transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V 
Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a 
cap).

I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared 
listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary 
development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go 
into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the 
secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re 
your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to 
you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I have marked it up with my comments for our discussion.  Also,
1.  Is DevCo the "Agent" as stated in the first paragraph of the Consent, or
the "Buyer" (or both)?  If DevCo is not the Buyer, who is and shouldn't they
sign the Consent?

2.  I have not attempted to add the requirement for 15/18 months evidence of
the units going into a "real project" vs. staying in DevCo and thus
remaining in the financing structure because I don't know if it really
belongs in the Consent.  Remember the issue is that the financing is not
sufficient to pay for all of the units so some (how many?) must be
refinanced out before new ones can come in.  Failure to do this means we get
suspended/terminated.  Based on the direction from Stan for Entergy: seek to
get the right to stop if they can't show a project 15/18 from delivery, we
should discuss where we think this should go.

3.  Related to 2 above, we must have payment ahead of termination or an LC
for the delta.  We discussed an LC with Enron two phone calls ago and they
were going to check on the ability to get this.  The SPV must minimally show
the ability to pay the termination.  Has Commercial Finance looked at the
pay/terminate schedules?

I am back in the office tomorrow.

Here's the bill of sale I promised to you.  Why don't you arrange a call/mtg 
with Rose and me to discuss form of notice/information.  We should probably 
start with the WestLB Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption form and 
redraft it to include what we want and think the bank will require in 
addition to what they asked for.

The GE facility agreements are nearing completion.  There will be facility 
agreements for Fountain Valley (aka PSCO) and for LV Co Gen.  The form is 
attached for your review.

In addition to the facility agreements, the parties will execute the override 
letters, in the form we developed last month.   Here is the override letter:




Please advise if there are any issues which need to be addressed.

changes from the form documents.

To complete each, we will need:

1. The contact information for Sections 6.7.2, 25.1 and 25.3 of the
Agreement.

2. Please have the business team confirm the Purchase Amount and
the Guaranteed Delivery Dates.  The information that I pulled off of the
spreadsheet that you provided (which is the information incorporated in
the Agreement) is inconsistent with the information that Alan Larsen
provided.

3. Do we want to use the Exhibit B-1 (Specification) from the
original West LB Agreement for this deal?

4. Do we need Exhibit R (Schedule of Witness Test Points)?

5.  Exhibit H will be attached prior to execution.

Kay and Gregg,

Attached for your review are the revised (and redlines) of the (i) CA for 
enovate empolyees; and (ii) Financial Services Agreement.

As for the CA, I have given it a term from the date of execution until 
October 4, 2004.  It would be best for Peoples to provide their own form of 
CA for the information they want to be subject to a confidentiality.;

As for the Financial Services Agreement, I have incorporated the duties of 
the Managing Member from the LLC Agreement.  It is my understanding that 
Gregg has requested assistance from Enron Tax to complete Paragraph 2(a) and 
2(d) and will touch base with Travis regarding Paragraph 3 to identify the 
nature of the expenses that would be incurred by Enron Corp.

These drafts are subject to Kay's review and approval, but we are one step 
closer.

Please let me know your comments and I will incorporate accordingly.

Kathleen

I'll forward a copy to Mark Mullen/Steve Thome when I see the invoice.

I'm ready, but don't recall seeing the final execution version.  Did I miss
that e-mail?
Sure, Change Order #1 at same time would be good.  Payment terms are to
level paid, so that would be same as 100%.

No, I've not seen the sig pages.  How were they being sent?  and who?

Lee,

The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy
the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.

Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we
could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be
whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.

Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

Kay,

Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units
bound
for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion.
Also,
we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power
System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need
4
Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order.

this is going out to a broad group and may not be relevant to some, but 
please be aware that other ENA assets may go into the velocity/condor 
structure at a couple points this year. also we can all pray (i think it is 
ok to use this word in the current political climate and in a secular sense, 
as i think our interests are aligned on this) that the ENE stock price goes 
up and for more room in the raptor vehicle so we may see more raptor hedges.

1.. as most of you are aware, the majority of ENA's merchant assets are in 
our project velocity structure. just to make sure that we confuse everyone, 
we use condor/whitewing/velocity/trutta names interchangeably although 
occasionally there are some distinctions (which i won't bore you with the 
details about so you can disavow all knowledge if you have/need/want to). 
just so you get the right lingo, trutta is the name of the ENA subsidiary 
where these assets now have a home. ENA, under a servicing agreement, is the 
servicer of the assets. i am attaching for your information the servicing 
guidelines in the agreement. the major restriction is that ENA cannot  sell 
assets for less than the contributed value into the structure. any EARLY 
warning of a potential sale of any of these assets would be greatly 
appreciated so we can check whether any restrictions apply and be ready, as 
there are some logistics involved. an email to donna lowry, mary heinitz and 
myself would be wonderful. if you do not do this, you may get on donna's 
list. of course i can't speak for her as to the repercussions envisioned, but 
let me suffice it to say that i am glad i am not on her list. at least that i 
know of.  

2. a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to 
being in the velocity structure. only the portion of the investment that was 
on ENA's balance sheet was hedged. if an asset is sold that has been 
"raptorized", the swap will need to be promptly terminated/notional amounts 
adjusted etc. again, give us as much notice as you can.

3. we also need notice (AHEAD OF TIME) of any follow on investments in the 
same merchant assets, exchanges of our interest or further fundings because 
STUFF will have to be done. i will not bore you with the details, but this 
STUFF cannot be done in ONE MINUTE contrary to the popular opinion of some 
business types whose names i will not mention here. we also are obligated to 
provide quarterly reports of the investments which describe any modifications 
to the investments during that calendar quarter. the first report is due 
april 11, 2001 for the first quarter of this year. we will be asking for your 
input with respect to your investments at the end of march. 

4. lists of assets currently in velocity and in raptor are attached fyi.

why does LM6000 contract still have brackets around the number of turbines to 
be assigned to WestLB?  Why does it still ignore the change orders rose asked 
you to include?

why does schedule v to PA still ignore the change orders to the various 
documents?

Please correct or advise why requests for changes are NOT being made.

As you know,  these documents are deliverables on Wednesday.  Blue Dog had 
comments from the other side today.  Why haven't I seen a revision or been 
asked if I agree with their comments?  

Please do not operate in a vacuum without consulting me or Roseon 
questionable issues.

I  looked you up in Martindale to get your email address -- all my friends at 
Enron  have so many different email addresses these days that I don't hazard 
a  guess!? Saw that you are also an ex-Sonat attorney -- I thought your name  
was familiar!
?
Hope  this helps.? We had to push back a bit on pre-approval of future  
assignments, but hopefully it's a workable compromise.? Thanks for your  
efforts -- they registered big/helped.

Let us  know if we can do anything further to get this closed for you.? I'll 
be in  the office in Houston the rest of the week.

Attached are the execution copies of the Turbo Park documents that are 
relevant to power plant equipment procurement and development.   I have asked 
Finance to provide us with summaries of the relevant provisions since the 
120+ page Participation Agreement, which is largely a loan agreement, is very 
complex.  I will nevertheless attempt to summarize the "process" of getting 
into and out of TurboPark.  In the meantime, please familiarize yourselves

dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little

right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable. [Mark Hall]    That 
should be ok.

Good Afternoon Kay,

The Mitsubishi equipment was purchased through WestLB.  Additionally I am 
working on the Las Vegas Cogen Project with a WestLB structure.  I am 
purchasing a steam turbine and four HRSG's.  

Give me a call at your convenience and I will give you any particulars

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

FYI

This message came in from the accounting group re: a combined option/water 
contract for the Longview project.

Apparently having separate documents for the option and the underlying 
contract is important from an accounting standpoint, even though there may be 
no difference in effect when compared with an option incorporated into the 
primary agreement.

Subject: FW: FW: Option for Wastewater Discharge and Water Reuse

Pursuant to discussions with AALLP, and as we discussed yesterday, combining 
the water agreement with the option agreement is contrary to the approach we 
agree upon with AALLP in configuring a true option agreement for water 
supply.  I explained our basic commercial reasons why we needed to do this to 
no avail.  The good news is that this, and only this agreement, may go out in 
your desired format but there will be no exceptions permitted going forward.  
Costs incurred around future documents that do not read as true option 
agreements prepared in accordance with parameters estab. with AALLP and 
accounting will be considered hard costs.  Hope this helps out.

Hi Herman,

Thank you for your quick review of the Option Agreement with CSOB. I will 
call you to discuss your comments further. However, there are some commercial 
reasons for combining the Wastewater Discharge and Effluent (Water reuse for 
cooling) into one option agreement. These reasons include the following:

1) Timing - We need to secure the wastewater discharge ability sooner than we 
can pull together all of the details for a firm agreement. By highlighting 
the major issues in the Option Agreeement we can confirm our discharge route 
while we pull together the details for the underlying agreement. At this 
point the Wastewater Discharge agreement that you referred to is on hold 
until we have additional technical and permitting information. It is also 
critical to ensure our ability to obtain effluent for cooling, prior to 
firming up all of the details for a separate, underlying agreement on 
effluent. 

2) Combination is faster - Given the timing concerns expressed above, it is 
faster to get there with one agreement rather than trying to work with the 
CSOB on two agreements. The proposals that we are suggesting to the CSOB are 
very new and somewhat out of their comfort zone. It is easier to get them 
comfortable with these concepts in one agreement and at one time rather than 
in two separate agreements. 

As I mentioned, I will call you to discuss further, but hopefully the above 
helps shed some light on our reasons for pulling together the agreement in 
this format. 

Regards,
Laura

I think this Option Agreement and Wastewater Discharge Agreement should be 
two separate agreements.  What I mean by this is that the items in 1 
a(i)-(ix) and 1 b(i)-(ii) should be carved out of this agreement and placed 
in the Wasterwater Discharge Agreement.  Remainder looks ok.

Hello,

Please see the attached Option Agreement. The intent of the Option is to firm 
up details for LED to discharge plant wastewater to the Cowlitz County sewer 
treatment plant's (referred to as Cowlitz Water Pollution Control "CWPC" 
plant) existing outfall on the Columbia River as well as obtain wastewater 
from CWPC for use in cooling. 

To give a little background, given our proximity to CWPC, the ability to 
discharge to CWPC's Columbia River outfall is a viable plan. It reduces the 
permitting time that would be required if we built our on outfall to the 
Columbia. It is cheaper than sending all of the plant wastewater through the 
whole treatment facility, especially given that cooling tower blowdown 
(primary source of plant wastewater) is very clean. 

We are also requesting effluent as a source of water for plant cooling given 
that the Port's ability to obtain new water rights is unclear at this point. 
Obtaining CWPC effluent is a viable option for plant cooling. 

Please contact me or Bob Carter if you have questions about this document. I 
expect to meet with the County next week to discuss. I would appreciate your 
comments mid-next week. On a priority scale, comments on this prior to the 
Water Agreement (sent in my previous e-mail) would be appreciated. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Next week, Herman and I will be working on a generic 97-10 compliant EPC 
contract.

Could you forward electronic versions of 1) basic fixed price EPC contract 
and 2) basic Cost Plus EPC contract.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
picture status?

Bart,

I will try my hardest to take care of this today.  We have a mandatory 
offsite from 9:00-1:00 today (fyi).  I can't tell you how glad I was to see 
this message because I am working on another Law Gibb PSA and related tasking 
letter on a Florida sitre and did not know that there were certain 
requirements to be met to fit within TurboPark.

Can you organize the Law Gibb Professional Services Agreement and amendments

and send them to Herman? I also gave you my FP&L interconnection file, and I 
believe the agreement referred to by Herman is in there, so if you would 
please send him that as well. Please send him copies as he likes to mark on 
things.  Thanks.

Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

Attached are Turbo Park and accounting "approved" forms of the Technical 
Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the 
Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & 
Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the 
business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA 
underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and 
the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in 
the TDSA ), and not the "improvements" ( which term was included in the draft 
Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will 
need to "clone" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to 
deal with such "improvements" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these 
are the King Plant improvements).

The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front 
of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and 
restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will 
be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its 
interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would 
be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the 
FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of 
Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other 
development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently 
transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost 
expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by 
Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park.

The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with 
FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is 
negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms 
that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement 
because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may 
want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be 
comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the 
transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the 
transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V 
Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a 
cap).

I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared 
listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary 
development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go 
into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the 
secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re 
your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to 
you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay

I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments 
sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I 
dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little 
with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's 
right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.

Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the 
project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.



Please advise if you have any comments.

		 Subject: URGENT: Draft Turbo Park EPC contract comments

I attach legal comments  produced by David Lund and myself over the holiday 
to the Turbo Park EPC  Draft No. 3 sent to us last week.  I also attach the 
clean and compared forms of the Turbo Park contract on which we based our 
comments and a chart of the proposed Turbo Park structure. I understand that 
these documents are intended to be confidential and are not to be shared with 
third parties, including vendors, subcontractors,  or other counterparties.

For the benefit of the EECC and NEPCO people who have not been involved in 
the discussions yet, Turbo Park is intended to be a "9710 compliant 
off-balance sheet financing structure" that would allow not only equipment 
purchases but also project construction to be financed and executed 
off-balance sheet.  The form EPC will be to some extent pre-approved by the 
lenders for use with the Turbo Park facility.

 Although EECC/NEPCO are just now getting involved, I understand that the 
Turbo Park team needs to get some level of sign-off on the EPC by this 
Friday, presumably so that they can finalize  their documentation with the 
banks.   The degree of sign-off and the ability to make changes after that 
sign-off is unclear  to me, but at this point I am not aware of any 
particular construction project that the form must be made to fit by Friday. 
[I have not  been provided with any forms of attachments, and suspect that 
none need to be produced by this Friday. Roseann or Sheila, could you find 
out from your teams if this is the case?]

Larry Izzo has asked that Peter Nassab have John Rigby get involved in the 
review of the attached contract, and that Dick Westfahl be made aware of the 
matter since NEPCO will be the contractor for these projects as a general 
rule.  David Lund has asked that Gene Larson look it over for NEPCO.  I 
suggest that you start with the attached comments before you launch into the 
drafts themselves.

We are  arranging a meeting with ENA and Enron Global Finance to coordinate 
discussion of these comments, any additional comments from EECC and NEPCO, 
and what EECC and NEPCO should expect from the Turbo Park project in the near 
term, and will get back to you as soon as this is arranged. With any luck at 
all, this effort will lead to a standard from not ionly for use with Turbo 
Park, but also for general use between EECC/NEPCO and ENA, and thereby 
significantly reduce transactions costs and time going forward.

Roseann and Sheila, please forward this as appropriate to your respective 
team members and let us know when you have had a chance to digest the changes.

I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

Subject: CA Development I and II notice of exercise of purchase option

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay
