Subject: For Discussion: Implementing Definition of Trading Office

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will 
require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be 
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is 
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without 
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

Thanks

JG

Evidently, we need to get Mike and James' consent to send someone over to London....  Clara was over there working on rate & currency which has nothing to do with London.

I am starting to hear more and more noise about James' attitude.  It is getting to the point (and possibly is already) that no one wants to work with him and it could isolate London operations even further from the mainstream.  It may be time for someone to have a heart-to-heart with him (Fernley?).

Clara was there to work with Shane on some items for the London Rate & Currency desk.  Clara was also working with the IT person we have in London who is  working to improve the processes of how curves are loaded as well as how cash flows are received.  
In the prior weeks when Shane and I met with some of the groups, I had told them that Clara would be over to follow-up on some of the items.

Sheila,

I am disappointed to say that neither Mike or I were knowingly told of Clara's visit and she didn't introduce herself or explain what she was doing to either of us. She also arrived at a time when Michael Kass was on holiday. As a result of this I am concerned about the success of her trip and some of the conclusions she may have drawn.

I would therefore appreciate it if you could arrange for a summary of the purpose, results and conclusions that followed her week's work so that we can all understand what the future holds.


Thanks James

More detail than you probably want on the document I gave you at the 
Doubletree....  Mike was responding to an email that Steve Young had sent 
him.  Just wanted you to know that this is moving forward and that I will 
coordinate the Houston side of this for now (I will coordinate London going 
forward if that responsibility is given to me).  Let me know if you have 
questions.

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Steve

My assessment of the next steps are as follows :-

We finalise the intial draft of the one page summary  - Action Mike/Brent to 
consolidate feedback to date - to be delivered tomorrow
The one pager to be sent to all business heads commenting on John's belief ( 
which I think we all share ) that the Business unit head has ultimate 
responsibility to ensure operating standards are met and that we aim to 
provide them with a joint summary of 'status' from Commercial Support and 
RAC. This summary could be reviewed by AA, but I believe the process would be 
more beneficial if it is 
a self assessment process
escalates judgement on material issues 
capable of being monitored and repeated on an agreed frequency
complimentary to the BRM process
The timeline for thie intial feedback could be within one week - I have an 
assessment from David Port to match to ours already!

As to your other questions

I will be adding two additional detail points within the required structure 
definition - ie the structure must have :-

Full functionality and interfaces for market risk, credit risk and Corporate 
reporting, and/or a systems roadmap for that development
Appropriate involvement in business for specialist services ( Legal, Tax and 
HR )

The Operating Standards MUST only cover one page to retain the ease of 
communication for them - the above definitions identify that businesses must 
consider all Legal and RAC issues - and there will significant detail 
involved in that - which will be defined elsewhere ( see David's separate 
comments on risk reporting )

In summary I think it is best to move to publish the intial draft to 
stimulate communication  - would welcome your thoughts

Mike

 - some changes  -awaiting possible additions from Brent  - if none - to be 
published tomorrow

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Mike: 

Is this the most current version of the proposed Operating Standards?  Since 
I've been out of the office since we last discussed, I wanted to get an 
update on the status.  A couple of questions: 

What are the next steps? 
How will this be communicated and to whom?
How do you see this being implemented to best assure it is respected?
Legal Standards are absent?  I suspect this is still in draft form and they 
are to follow in the next version; however, let me know how you see legal 
Standards playing into this as I believe they should be on this list as well.

As discussed, I strongly believe that a brief and clear list of "absolutes" 
similar to the attachment will be most useful if first agreed by all that 
need to be involved and then effectively communicated and respected by all in 
EEL.  Let me know if this list is now considered representative of the views 
of all that need to have input.  I suggest we meet again with a broader group 
to assure this list is complete and to discuss next steps.  I have some 
suggested adjustments but will get back to you by end of week with comments 
or questions from RAC after we discuss this in our weekly RAC manager's 
meeting.   

Thanks,

Steve

Due to a system error this original email could not open the powerpoint 
presentation. Please launch the attachment. 


Enron Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Financial Operations & Accounting
Tom Myers will continue in his role of managing EGM Financial Operations & 
Accounting.  Tom and his group are responsible for EGM management reporting, 
Plan & Current Estimate preparation, the financial close process and G/L 
controls.

Please see the attached organizational chart for a more detailed look at the 
changes discussed above.

 

   Please join me in congratulating everyone on their new assignments.

Rick - You had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the 
different systems used by commodity, by office and by functional group.  This

this document to include other offices and products in the next few months.  
Let me know your questions and comments.

Slight interest; could see as a fit in Risk or Strucuturing.  EGM has no 
immediate openings in either but I am always open to the possibility of going 
long people in those areas.  He was supposed to get back to me if he had 
interest in EGM - have not heard from him yet.

Just a word of thanks for setting up the interviews last week.  I was 
thoroughly impressed with the groups and saw several areas which I would like 
to explore further.  I will be following up with Beth Apollo, Brenda Herod 
and Brent Price to explore opportunities in their areas.  Again, thanks for 
your kind gesture and even more so, thanks for meeting me at the suggestion 
of Liz Taylor.

This goes to a discussion I had with Jeff this morning.  We have had IT 
problems of some sort or another every day this week which has prevented us 
from getting the daily reports out by 8:30 (our target time with Jeff).  I 
have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to 
reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT 
perspective.  The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a 
different problem every day (metacalc, servers going down, Lotus Notes 
problems...).  I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate.  
I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that 
these problems do not continue.

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.  
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too 
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you 
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  

Thanks.

Jeff

Looks like we can get some help to automate the swaption notification process 
going forward...

Souad,

There are expiration dates for swaptions/options on the "Detail" button in 
TAGG Deal Capture.  Let's
do the following.  Go into TAGG Deal Capture and check to make sure these 
dates are valid for swaptions/options.

We will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are  
expiring.

Thanks, Ron

We really need to raise the priority on getting this done.  We had a swaption 
with significant value to Enron not get excersied this month due to 
breakdowns in the manual process.  Let me know how extensive this will be 
from an IT perspective.  Thanks

the reason for this message and the other message addressed to Jeff Johnson 
is that we have system modifications that due to system resources may or may 
not get done.  note the ClickPaper comment.

Souad,

We can implement this - the question is "when". As I indicated to Jeff, we 
are currently working on ClickPaper
but we will work on whatever is a higher priority from Enron's point of view.

Thanks, Ron

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks. 


I work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or suggestions (X37580).

We have all talked and are in agreement that financial confirms/settlements 
are the responsibility of Kim Theriot.  Leslie is going to sent out a memo 
discussing the organizational changes within that group that will clearly 
communicate that message to all of wholesale.  Let me know if you have any 
other questions.

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.
