With deep regret we announce that Joe Sutton, Vice Chairman of Enron, has 
decided to leave the company.  Joe has indicated his desire to pursue other 
opportunities in the energy asset development and operations business.

Joe has been instrumental in making Enron a global company.  We will miss his 
energy and enthusiasm.  We wish Joe the very best as he pursues new endeavors.

As you probably know by now, Enron recently entered into a new relationship
with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a
more efficient ordering process.

Name:
Business Unit:

Phase I of the program, which starts January 2, 2001,  encompasses all
administrative/clerical temporary employees in the Houston area.  Please
note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on
assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer
any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be
available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.  Please note that the
current process for requesting temporary employees will remain in effect
through the end of the year.

Thank you,
The Enron Corp Implementation Team

You are right, Vince....Celeste and I did discuss it, and she approved his 
Feb. start date.
Datren does know about that, so it sounds like it is cleared up.

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

"My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,
Datren W."

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,
Carol

Jeff,

The newsletter is addressed to a wide audience in Enron, not
exclusively one group. We are providing forward interest rate
foreign exchange curves to multiple units of Enron
to revalue our assets. Maureen and Gwen spend
of lot of time answering questions regarding countries
like Argentina, Korea, Brazil, etc. The newsletter can
be used as a reference in answering many of those 
questions.

As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=
. =20
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=
e=20
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the=
=20
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of=20
August 3rd less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge. =20
Enron=01,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corpora=

e=20
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, =
we=20
can easily surpass these goals.=20

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=
%=20
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has=20
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the=
=20
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a=20
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this yea=
r=20
than last year.  Enron has 39 members of this Society, only 5 of which are=
=20
from ENA.  I would like to see this number increase significantly and if yo=
u=20
are able, I would like you to consider stepping up to this level.  Given th=
e=20
fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and=
=20
bonus program, I encourage each of you to at least become a member of the=
=20
"Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of your annual=20
salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your pledge this=20
year, regardless of your level of giving last year.
=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=
=20
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across=
=20
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=
=20
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our=20
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your=20
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our=20
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and=20
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

Good morning Vince,

Could you please provide with some guidance in relation to Mark's comments 
directly below.  I don't have any recollection of recent case studies that we 
could send Oddbjorn Tysnes - do you know of any?

I will send him a number of reprints of articles.  Please let me know if you 
have anything at your fingertips....

Regards,

Cindy

I don't want to spend a lot of time right now, from this office, pursuing 
these opportunities.  But, if we have some case studies "on the shelf" we 
could send something to Oddbjorn.

Thanks, 

Mark

Dear Mark,

I want to thank you for two very interesting days and a very pleasant
evening in London at the European PR conference.

As you may remember from the session "Ideas Forum", I presented an idea of
introducing Enron's transformation from an "old" industry/energy company to
an innovative player in the "new" economy as a case study at the leading
Nordic business schools. I have later discussed the idea with Enron's head
of the Nordic region, Thor Lien. He agrees that this could be a good way of
raising the awareness of Enron in the Nordic business community. One reason
for this is that several professors of the Nordic business schools are
frequent speakers at business conferences, they are very often sought by
business reporters to give comments etc. If Enron becomes a "top of mind"
innovative company with these professors, it will help relation-building and
PR work towards the business community.

I understood from you that some US business schools have developed similar
(?) case studies on Enron. Do you or someone else in Enron have access to
such case studies? If so, would it be possible for you to send us copies? It
would be a great help for us.

Best regards,
Oddbjorn Tysnes

     Sherri and Alhamd,
     
     Just wanted to let you know that I heard Jeff Skilling really 
     impressed Chairman Greenspan this morning (I did not attend the 
     meeting.)
     
     Thanks for all you help making sure the presentation went off without 
     a hitch.
     
     Daron

Daron,
     
We are not yet finished with Jeff's presentation, and probably won't be 
completely finished until tomorrow afternoon - just about the time that 
Jeff will leave for Dallas.  In addition, e-mailing the complete 
presentation may not be an option due to the size of the file.
     
I've asked Hamd to e-mail you want we have right now so that you can test 
it with your system.  We'll then send a CD with the entire presentation 
along with Jeff to Dallas.  I'll ask Jeff to deliver it to you at the 
dinner Wednesday evening, so perhaps your AV people can test it that night.
     
Daron, I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  If you have 
another idea as to how to handle this situation, we're certainly willing to 
entertain it.
     
Thanks, SRS

It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

Ah, these wonderful new systems!  I submitted an order on the "new" IBuyit
site and sent it for approval and it went to every manager in our group!

I called them and told them that only you were the approver and they do not
even have a user ID set up for you.  Please fill out the below security document
and I will forward it on to them.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley

In processing your iBuyit approval change request, I discovered that Vince Kaminski has not been set up with a user ID in the eProcurement system.  Please have him fill out the attached security form and send it to -- SAP Security@enron.com

I have already selected the Approver role on the second page.  We just need the personal information on page one filled out for security purposes.  Once this is done we can get Vince assigned as the approver for cost center 107043.

Thanks,
Michael

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets (EFM) launched its over-the-road trucking business this week.  In addition, EFM completed 199 intermodal transactions in the first week of April.

ENA West Power
ENA West Power recently closed the sale of two power projects.  The 750MW Pastoria Energy Facility in Kern County, California was sold to Calpine and the 240MW Fountain Valley Power project in Colorado was sold to Black Hills Energy Capital.  Given the power shortage in the West, ENA is developing additional power generation in Nevada, California and Washington.

Enron Industrial Markets
The newsprint group of EIM is working to revolutionize the newsprint market and bring financial rigor and market efficiencies to a business that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century. The global newsprint market is a 23 billion dollar a year business with the North American market comprising one third.  The group's originators, mid-marketers, and financial and physical traders offer our customers numerous financial and physical products not previously available in the market. 

EIM has made a substantial commitment to this business with the purchase of Garden State Paper company last year and the recent purchase of Daishowa Paper in Quebec City. The number of transactions has grown exponentially with the physical trading alone reaching a nominal trading volume of more than $10,000,000 per month in little more than four months since opening.  In addition to physical spot transactions, the desk offers our counterparties log-term fixed priced transactions, indexed based pricing, forward contracts, swaps, and derivative products.

Forest Products
Forestweb Inc., an Internet-based generator, aggregator and integrator of knowledge and information for the forest products industry, announced a new window to industry financial and risk management tools available from Clickpaper.com. Clickpaper allows the industry direct access to transactable prices for both physical and financial products, in an electronic format.

Paperloop.com, one of the leading online resources for the forest products industry, announced the addition of Clickpaper.com in their emarketplace, which showcases various e-commerce companies and highlights their services. Paperloop provides Clickpaper.com exposure to its 250,000+ monthly users in the pulp, paper and converting industries. 


IN THE NEWS

Ken Lay was the cover story for the April 2001 issue of Continental Magazine.  He had positive things to say about his employees.

"Sitting in his 50th floor mahogany-paneled office overlooking his much-beloved downtown Houston, Lay, with a self-conscious smile, bows his head slightly as he's described as an innovative market maker.  'I really can't take any credit, he says. My employees are responsible for what Enron does.'  What he does best, the Missouri-born corporate icon says, is 'to create an atmosphere of empowerment and creativity and hire bright, innovative people who aren't afraid to take risks and try new things."

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Poland obtains Gas Trading License
On 22nd March 2001 Enron Poland received a 10-year Gas Trading License, valid for both domestic gas trading within Poland as well as for gas exports.  The license is a key component to our entering the gas trading market in Poland and, coupled with the Power Trading License we obtained in 1999, will give Enron Poland a strong position in the developing wholesale energy market.  In the next two to three weeks, we expect to receive a cross-border trading license covering gas imports that are further regulated under the Polish Energy Law Ordinance on Gas Import Diversification.

Enron Wind announces first UK off-shore wind farm
On 5th April 2001, Enron Wind announced that it had been granted the right to initiate the planning process for its first UK offshore wind farm, located at Gunfleet Sands, 7km from Clacton-upon-Sea in Essex.  Construction is expected to start towards the end of 2002, with the wind farm of 30 turbines being operational by Q4 2003.  Enron Wind is also actively involved in a number of on-shore projects in the UK, including the development of wind farms in Wales and Northern Ireland.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=
nd=20
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01=
8=20
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will=
=20
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe=
r=20
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=
=20
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =
 =20
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=
e=20
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=
nd=20
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=
=20
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=
te=20
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=
=20
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=
l=20
rotate.=20
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of=
=20
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=
=20
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=
=20
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=
=20
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=
M=20
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=

of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview=

at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp   =20
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who=20

We thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.

I have several queries re the Avister charges for London, primarily because=
=20
the spreadsheet is based on a total of 24 London users.  We have a total of=
=20
14 Avistar users installed in London.=20

I believe the following London departments may have been charged for the=20
incorrect number of users:

Fin=01,l Trading  - $74,418.83  based on 4 units but have 5 users
Rate & Currency     (John Greene not listed?)
342-100467

Softs MG  - $42,857.23  based on 4 units but have only 1 user
1105-120415      (Nigel Majury)

Credit Derivitives - $16,168.42  based on 2 units but none installed
0342-102843      (3 users on Via Video pilot)

Liquids   - $56,589.46  based on 7 units but only 6 installed
872C-104546      (Niamh Clarke no longer based in London)

Shankman London - $16,168.42  based on 2 units but none installed
0342-103058      (Brad Hitch/Merrill Thomas no longer in dept.)

EEL-Exec  - $8,084.21  based on 1 unit for John Sherriff who is
0342-100309      on Via Video pilot - Avistar not installed

Legal London  - $8,084.21  based on 1 unit for Michael Brown- Avistar=20
0342-100348      not installed

London IT  - $16,168.42  based on two units but only one required
0342-100348      to administer system

The above figures are based on an original average $10,276 per seat. =20
However, a base change from 24 to 14 seats would increase the per seat char=
ge=20
to $17,616.

We also ought to look at charging out the ISDN calls charges for the Avista=
r=20
system (in the region of $187,000 for 4 months).

Hello to each of you.  I would like to let you know that I will be 
facilitating the 2000 Chairman's Award program, a Vision & Values initiative 
designed to recognize those employees who daily embody Enron's values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  This is an annual, 
employee-driven award which encourages employees to nominate their everyday 
heroes.

A critical component of the award process, and one in which Ken Lay has given 
his full support, is the Employee Selection Committee.  This year's Selection 
Committee is made up of a diverse representation from our workforce both in 
the US and around the world.  These individuals were chosen as last year's 
Chairman's Roundtable and have been invited to be part of this year's 
Employee Selection Committee.  Their infallible enthusiasm for Enron's Vision 
& Values will support the seamless transition from recognized winners to 
award decision-makers which is necessary to sustain the spirit of the award.

You are being notified because one of your employees is on this important 
committee.  The time commitment will be primarily during the first two weeks 
of October when we will meet either in person or via video / phone 
conferencing to review the nominations and select the winners.

I hope you will congratulate and support them as this is a special honor to 
be asked to serve on the Employee Selection Committee.  If you have any 
questions at any time, please feel free to contact me via email or phone.

Warm regards,

Charla Reese

Thank you for volunteering your time for this weekend's Super Saturday.  We 
appreciate your commitment to Enron's recruiting success.  At this time we do 
have an adequate number of interviewers and will not need you to sacrifice 
your Saturday.  However, as last minute changes occur in the interview 
schedule we may have to contact you for back up.    

Although we are in good shape so far for Saturday, our off-cycle recruiting 
department  is looking for interview volunteers for the following dates:

Thursday, November 9th from 9:00 a.m - 12:00 p.m
Thursday, November 16th from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.
Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -1:00 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing over these 3 days.  The candidates 
will be a combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as 
Princeton, Harvard, University of North Carolina, Notre Dame, University of 
Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each candidate will have 4 interviews.  
Pending the outcome of their interviews we will invite them to stay and 
attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some reason we decide not to 
further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home that Friday morning.

We are asking Enron employees manager level or higher  to volunteer at least 
ONE HOUR to interview candidates (you will see two candidates in that time).  
If you can volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the 
stated dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact 
Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@enron.com or x54049 as soon as possible, if you can 
volunteer any time for interviewing.

Thanks again for your participation in the Associate & Analyst Programs.

Becky,

The charges to Corp. go to RAC and are based on my projections of expected 
expenses.

The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the 
parenthesis show
amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to RAC:

1. Value-at-Risk Group (VaR)

MD (25%)
VP (60%)
Director (100%)
5 managers (100%)

2. Enterprise wide risk management

Manager (100%)
Associate (100%)

Currently we hired (or will shortly hire)  4 managers for the VaR group. The 
expansion of the VaR
group was planned based on the requests from RAC for more support.

Becky, 
I am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within 
Corporate, as they will be the ones accepting/rejecting these charges.  I am 
forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the Corp. departments 
for their review.  So, do not consider Corp as "in agreement" until you hear 
back from me.  I also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and I have a few 
questions relating to both 2000 and 2001:

1. What is ESource?
2. What is ENA Ops Direct?
3. What is ENA OCC Direct?
4. What is ENA CO 021?  Is this Vince Kaminsky's group?  The charges for 2000 
have been about $16k and $20k to the RAC group, so at that rate, I would 
expect 2001 to be no more than $250k-$300k, but the plan amount you sent is 
$1.9MM.  I will need some detail on this.

Thanks,
Steve

Attached is the 2001 PRELIMINARY inter-company billing.  ENA will be billing 
plan numbers for all departments except for External Legal and External Tax, 
which will be billed base on actual.  A quarterly review will be done to 
determine the variance between plan vs. actual amounts.  If the variance 
amount is material, we will adjust the billing to your Business Unit 
accordingly.  

If you have any questions, call me at 5-7094.  Please review this billing, 
and notify me with any questions by Wednesday, December 20, 2000; otherwise, 
it is assumed that you agree to the intercompany billing from ENA.  

You are the only person in your Business Unit receiving this invoice.  If 
this invoice needs to go to someone else in your business unit,  please 
forward to the correct person and can I be included in the forward e-mail?

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Celeste,

I have talked to you last evening about Elena Chilkina,
an MBA Rice student who works for us part-time during the academic year,
and full time this summer. 

She asked if she could participate in the program for summer associates.
(presentations, social meetings),

I would appreciate if you could help her.

Vince

Vince,

If you are interested in this candidate I would suggest that you talk to him 
directly.  He probably is not a "fit" for the Global Technology Track.

Thanks,

The memo distributed on June 27 on Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items 
requires
clarification.  The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate 
method
of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc.  Employees can continue to submit 
these
invoices to Accounts Payable for processing or  pay these items with their 
corporate
American Express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.  
Either
way is an acceptable way to process these small dollar high volume invoices.

Enron Broadband Services is the latest addition to the Enron SAP rollout.  
The Apollo and Beyond project team and Enron's business units are currently 
preparing for the project's final implementation.  Apollo and Beyond is an 
Enron initiative tasked with laying a common financial, human resources, 
project management, and procurement foundation throughout the majority of 
Enron's businesses.

EBS "Go-Live"

On April 1st, Enron Broadband Services supplemented their current SAP 
functionality with HR Online and SAP HR, including payroll and organizational 
structure management.  HR Online enables the EBS population to enter their 
own time, view and update their personal information, and view their vacation 
time and individual payroll information via Enron's intranet.

Additionally, this implementation enhanced the SAP Financial, Project and 
Procurement processes that EBS has had in operation since April 1, 1999.  
These enhancements included an EBS pilot of B2B, a web-based requisitioning 
tool. Among the benefits of these enhancements will be improved information 
flow across business units currently on SAP.

July 1 "Go-Live"

This final Apollo and Beyond implementation will directly impact more than 
15,000 Enron employees and contractors -- odds are that you are one of them!  
People impacted on July 1st include:

all Enron employees paid out of Corporate Payroll in Houston, excluding 
Azurix employees
the financial communities of Enron Energy Services, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation, Gas 
Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the project management communities of Enron North America, Gas Pipeline 
Group, Global Asset Operations, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the human resources communities of Corporate, Global E&P, Enron Energy 
Services, Enron Engineering and Construction Company, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation (Houston 
only), the international regions, Gas Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and 
Global Products.

General SAP training will be available in late April via the Enron intranet.  
Additional, specific, SAP classes and workshops are scheduled to begin in May 
and continue through August.  Information on the project can be obtained 
through the Enron intranet at http://sap.enron.com and by contacting Business 
Unit representatives currently working with the project.  A list of Business 
Unit representatives is located on the intranet site.

Additional information related to the July 1st implementation will be 
communicated to you over the next few months.

Thank you.

Subject: Molecular Electronics Corp. Working Lunch

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Dear Vince:  I just wanted to thank you for supplying a copy of the book.
The article on the natural gas market is just what I've been looking for.
The new addition, coupled with the first version's discussion of the
volatility of the gas market in the mid 90's should be very helpful in
convincing these government watchdog types that basis adjustments in
pricing formulas are not some sinister plot to deprive the feds of their
royalties.  Or should if there is any rationality in government.

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards,

Steve Williams

Hello everyone.

This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use
the colored printer "Taj Mahal".

Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer
"Taj Mahal" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90% 
of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective.

If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest
of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color 
printer
and the rest on "Bandit" or "Wagon".

Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Shirley

To Margaret and Beth,

In order to ensure a comprehensive speech to Goveror Johanns, I am in the 
process of compiling some preliminary research on the Impacts of Energy 
Prices on Agri-business in Nebraska.  Before I can make a decision of whether 
I can accept this offer to speak, I would like to finish this preliminary 
study.  

I need to know the deadline of your request.  Can you give me a better 
understanding as to the duration of the speech and the type of forum in which 
I will be speaking?  Should I expect a Q&A after the speech?  Who will be in 
the audience?  What companies and CEO's will be attending the meeting?    Who 
will be speaking on energy derivatives?  Please let me know when you need my 
decision.  

Regards,

Maureen Raymond-Castaneda

Jeff,

I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
A separate message about  this visit will follow.

I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships 
with
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our 
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.

We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get 
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we 
are not
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:

1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  
underwriting two research
projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  
Nicholas Bambos
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain 
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and 
also to lock-up some very
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such 
programs.

2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every 
presentation
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes 
and hiring decisions.
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic 
program. In many cases,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach 
them during their 
senior years.

3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. 

Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to 
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important 
in shaping public  opinion
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of 
deregulation and design of new markets).

Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on 
personal commitment of a number
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and 
focus.

I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) 
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from 
our Analyst/Associate
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

Vince

In order to better understand the Research group, can I get a list of 
projects that your group works on during 2000?  Were these projects budgeted 
for separately in 2000?  If the answer is yes, can we do a comparison 
analysis on these projects (actual vs plan)?  Based on the 2001 plan, I do 
not think we budgeted by project, but I have to ask...  If you have any 
questions, please call me at 5-7094.  Thanx.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=

Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=

to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=

It is=20

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

steps  

I notice my calender doesn't yet seem to have this meeting scheduled. I will 
ask Kay Chapman (since Rhonna has now deserted me!) to help put a time 
together. Drew/Mary, FYI sorry I didn't get a chance to send you this before. 
Let me know if you want to attend, happy to have you there.

Gerry, can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we 
are looking to achieve here. In broad terms I am looking to do the following:

Update all on project we set HR Associate group and their recommendations
Discuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think 
we should also incorporate (see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by 
Associate group below).
Reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree:
Team for doing so
Resources and timimg
Methodology for agreeing final version.
My ambition is that we (but in particular Andrea, Bob, Gerry, Tim, Tana, Dan, 
Neil, myself and possibly Suzanne if she can given the work she had already 
done in this area) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without 
the need for a formation of a new team or group. Obviously everyone welcome 
to participate.

Tana/Dan,

Can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they 
can review before meeting. Could you also agree within your team who you 
would like to attend this meeting (I would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend 
rather than all).

Thanks




David

Rhonna,

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR "value index" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

David

Eric,

I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge.
I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS
site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. 

When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was 
ready
 and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.

I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.

I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

Vince-

Where might I find copies of the case studies Enron has published?  I'm 
particularly interested in the Sutton Bridge publication for Havard but would 
like to know if there is a library of case studies.

Subject:	PRC Feedback forms

Mr. Kaminski:

I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to discuss the draft  PRC 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate for your employee population.  The generic forms that were presented at the PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the organization.  

One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting  evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about this. 

   
  



Many Thanks,

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20

The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=

This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

I need your help...  I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget 
and I am showing a significant increase from last year.  Did we have an 
increase in headcount?  I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used 
the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year 
(see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the 
following tabs:

 Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001
 Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA
 2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
 Research  2001 budget

The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in 
your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will 
bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to 
ENA and the increase in plan?  I am open all week except for Wednesday 
between 10 and 11.  Thank you.

Subject: Super Saturday, June 3, 2000

During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA 
where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate 
level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I 
would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately  
25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I 
am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to 
facilitate this priority action item.

Ted Bland will be forwarding information concerning the event to each of you 
early next week.  

Thank you for your participation.  

Dave

You have probably heard that our group is being broken up. Some people were 
put in other groups but I was not fortunate enough to be one of those 
people.  HR will try for the month of March to find a position for me within 
Enron but that is not likely to happen.

Tomorrow is my last full day here - I will be in and out for the month of 
March.

I am informing nice people that I like and you are one of those.

Subject: Economic Espionage Act Presentation - August 15th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  "Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
"hypothetical" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence.  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.  Hope to 
see you there.


 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the "Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA)," and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=
w=20
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=
se=20
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=
=20
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=
 or=20
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department.

Cantekin,
Dolores Muzzy forwarded your e-mail.  I apologize for not answering sooner 
but I have been travelling.

Unfortunately, the  terms of the Associate Program compensation package are 
not negotiable.  We have reviewed our terms and believe we are competitive 
with our peers.  I have spoken with Vince Kaminski who will be calling you to 
discuss.

Given that it has taken 6 days to respond to you, if you are still 
considering Enron's offer of employment I will extend your deadline until 
October 24th.

Please call if you have any other questions.  

Sincerely,
Charlene Jackson

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

"To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling." --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release issued regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties. Otherwise the settlement is confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or otherwise.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Reminder:  Brown Bag Lunch, Thursday, May 17 at 11:30 AM in 5 C2. The speaker is Michael L. Miller discussing Principal Investments.

"Historically, Newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to "very discriminating" buyers at newspaper publishers. EIM believed differently.  By the end of March, EIM had succeeded in closing on its 2nd Newsprint mill, making it the 7th largest Newsprint manufacturer in North America.  Remarkably, in just 2 months, EIM's Newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100MM total notional value "Enron commodity style" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?..and they said it wasn't a commodity."
Rodney Malcolm - Vice President, Forest Products Sales and Marketing

Travel Tip of the Week:  Book flights 7 days in advance.  The cost savings can be considerable if you plan ahead - at least 7 days.
	For example:  Houston to Portland
	      Less than 7 days:		$ 1,652
	      7 day advance ticketing	$    324

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.


Vince

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Rhonna,

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR "value index" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

David

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Vince,
Thanks for your response.  Apparently, we were under the incorrect impression 
that your group would be taking Li (based on Jeff's note below).  We 
apologize for not contacting you last Friday to confirm prior to "placing" Li 
in your group.  I have faxed Li's resume to you and hope that you will have 
time to review it today.  Please call me back as soon as you can to discuss 
Li's opportunities in your group.  

If Vince is not interested in Li for his group, we will consider Li placed in 
ENA - Gas Trading (original placement) in John Lavorato's organization.  Once 
I hear from Vince one way or the other, the program will consider Li's 
placement final in either Research or ENA - Gas Trading.  Hopefully this will 
be resolved by Tuesday morning so that we may communicate to Li her rotation 
information.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank You!

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed 
up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

I left a message with one of Yaron's roommates on Thursday afternoon for him

to me and it was correct.  When I did not hear from Yaron I called on Friday 
and left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers.  I still did not hear

Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone 
number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals. 
Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but

Diane:

We have had quite a few problems with this iBuyit procedure.  I have submitted several invoices for payment since May 1st and
have reveived none of them back for coding and approval.  I am afraid the vendors are going to be coming after us!

We also have had approval problems.  I submitted a hardware request and it went to every manager in our group.  I think we 
have finally gotten that straightened out for the present.

The requestors and coders would be:
Shirley Crenshaw
Anita DuPont
Kevin Moore

The only approved for our group is Vince J. Kaminski (CO 0413 - CC 107043)

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Shirley

Per the request below, I need a list of people you would like to serve as approvers and requestors for the Research group for the iBuyit program.  Of course, they want this as soon as possible.  Please let me know who you would like to include.

Could you please gather this info for all your support departments?  

In case you don't know, iBuyit is the web site where employees can purchase, code, and approve invoices for items online.

The iBuyit team is trying to get a complete list of approvers and requestors for this program.  
For each of your teams, please send me the following:

names of approvers (team head, CC owner, etc.)
names of requestors (admins, anyone who would be ordering)
Cost Center

The iBuyit team wants to keep the number of requestors and approvers limited, but each team will need more than one approver.  Every requestor will have a pre-approved limit for each transaction.  Approvers will be required to go into the system and approve all transactions that exceed that limit in order for the transaction to be completed.

Unfortunately, we need this information as soon as possible (Monday afternoon at the latest)!

Please feel free to call me with any questions.

Thanks,
Misti

Subject: PRC Feedback forms

Mr. Kaminski:

I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to 
discuss the draft  PRC 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to 
ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate 
for your employee population.  The generic forms that were presented at the 
PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and 
to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely 
appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical 
areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time 
permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the 
organization.  

One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting  
evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, 
another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to 
the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would 
welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about 
this. 

   




Many Thanks,

What a kind and thoughtful man you always are, Vince....I have always 
appreciated
that in you!  I just moved to another position this week - with Sheila 
Knudsen in ENA
Compensation, but I will always remember how wonderful you are with the 
Associates
and Analysts in the Program, and will miss having the opportunity to touch 
base with
you occasionally.  Thank you for being the special man you are!

Carol

P.S.  I doubt that you know who I am, but I had worked with the program for 
two years, 
having been hired by Mike Smalling in October 1998.  When I first moved to 
Houston 
(from Ohio) and Enron, I rode the #35 bus for a short while.  You helped me 
find Enron the first
day I rode it,  but I didn't know who you were until I saw you at our Super 
Saturday 
activities.  You will never know how much that assistance meant to me - a 
shy, 
street-dumb girl from Toledo, Ohio, in a city like Houston, who didn't know 
how to 
ride a bus!  All of Enron loves you, and I know why!

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

"My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,
Datren W."

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,
Carol

i've asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince's 
group.  this issue needs to  be resolved by week's end--we look like we don't 
have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to 
make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new 
wharton recruit disgruntled.

vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up 
with our meeting with skilling?  thanks very much...

jeff

To:  Enron North America Corp.

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups whic=
h=20
focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and g=
as=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

Good Morning!

Thank you for taking time out of a busy Friday to allow our photographer to 
shoot some pictures for the ENSIDE.  I will contact you when the proofs are 
ready.

I have attached the article draft with revisions by Mike, Osman and Iris.  
Please peruse this draft and make any changes or corrections. I need it back 
for the layout team by Wednesday evening, April 4, if possible.

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy

Jeff, 

It seems that NYMEX will not make a decision any time soon
or they rejected Tom. I think the latter is the case.

Tom is looking for a trading or origination job with Enron.
I think that we can use his expertise here.

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=

that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=

Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies
    on processing huge volumes of information.

Vince

Vince,

My name is Shelly Jones, I am the analyst recruiting manager for the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  Christy Young passed on information from the 
University of Houston AIESEC program.  Due to the restructuring of the 
Associate/Analyst Program and the new policies regarding the interview

Molly,

I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he
(or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).

It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,
 but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
can productively use.

I shall take a look at some new features they offer
and decide whether it's worth the effort.

Hello Mr. Casari:

Myself and our Energy Trading Financial Team will be visiting with the R&D
group at Enron the week of 10/16/00.  They have several applications can be
dramatically improved with our tools.

We are very interested to understand the Bandwidth Trading Market, to see
if any additional challanges can be overcome with our tools. 

I would like to understand your challanges of modeling, simulating and
deploying applications to control risk.

Are you available to discuss these items prior to our visit?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks
Scott Wakefield

seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=

=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=

=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=

of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Michele,

I have defined the project for the students. It's   one project that is 
divided into three sections.

Feel free to stop by to talk about it.

I understand that you have been involved with the Wharton Tiger Teams.  I am 
the commerical team lead for Wharton recruiting.  Do you know the 3 projects 
that the students are working on and who within Enron is working with them on 
the projects?

Thanks for helping to facilitate this opportunity for Wharton students.

Hello Team,

I hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season.  

Down to business:  The University Affairs group is putting together a tiger 
team of students to do a project for Enron.  Those students will be in town 
on January 18th and will be having dinner at Churrasco's that night.  I think 
it would be a great opportunity for some of the Wharton alum to come out and 
meet the participants, talk about Enron and eat some good food.  :-)  If you 
are interested in participating please RSVP to me via email or at extension 
53214 no later than 1/5/01.  

Thank you and hope to see you soon,

Kristin Gandy

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.  The first annual 
Enron "Trash Bash" to clean up the banks of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd 
Drive and Sam Houston Park. 

I am chairing the Check-In Team which consists of:
Registering all of the Volunteers
Handing out Enron T-Shirts and Caps
Passing out Gloves and Garbage Bags
Making Clean Up Section Assignments
For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext. 
30329.


Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along Buffalo Bayou and pick up 
trash.  This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs 
youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop.  It will also be fun.  They 
will have live bands, lyou get an Enron T-shirt and Enron Baseball Cap, lunch 
will be served at Sam Houston Park and there are a lot of good door prizes.   
If you want to volunteer for the "Trash Bash" clean up, just show up at Sam 
Houston Park on Saturday, March 31, 2001, at 8 AM to Register.  Clean up 
starts at 9 AM and lunch will be served at 11:00 AM and after lunch door 
prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your 
part for Houston's Waterway Environment.

I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. and help 
Enron clean up the Environment.

Thanks, Anita

Folks,

I am a Vice President with Enron, and have been with the company some 6 years 
now.  I was hired through Enron Associate pool, and started off by marketing 
power on the East Coast with Jim Fallon.  Currently I am working in the India 
Region, looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in 
India, anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future.  
One of my challenges is to make the team in India aware of the type of 
sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading 
activities, as well as the range of products we have to offer.

I have been in conversation with Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman on the 
Global Products side, and are planning a session to acquaint the team in 
India with activities in that group.  Similarly, on the power side, we have 
been interacting with John Sherriff's team in London. 

I feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get 
acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in Houston, and to 
get an idea of the RAC process, the Research side, the Back-offices, as well 
as the trading operations here.  Similarly, the team there could present to 
you the state of the market in India, and give you an idea of the type of 
opportunities there.  I am therefore eliciting your support to put together a 
session in Houston where they can be acquainted with these functions, as well 
as the people responsible for them in the US.  There are three people in the 
group who would benefit from this exposure.  One of them is from the 
Associate pool, while the other two are people hired locally in India. 

I have already spoken with our COO, Wade Cline in this regard, and seek your 
support in putting together an agenda for such a session.  Please let me know 
who I should contact within your groups to discuss this further.

Regards,
Sandeep.

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been 
ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In 
addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of 
Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee 
Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco 
Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and 
brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's 
five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in 
Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.

You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring 
the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You 
contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding 
employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.

Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater 
achievements in 2000!

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position 
the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market 
and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a 
number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband 
Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the 
organization.  

Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will 
continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will 
continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management 
of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market 
capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief 
commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial 
functions of the organization.
  
In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently 
CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president 
and COO of Enron North America, where he has been instrumental in developing 
Enron's trading and risk management business in gas, electricity and other 
emerging markets.  Greg Whalley, president and COO of ENA, will again assume 
his responsibilities for Global Risk Management.

Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles.

Amy- -

Steve Kean and I finally got to discuss this the other day and we decided 
that this effort would likely be too time consuming and costly, particularly 
for certain key employees, to justify doing it.  It obviously is an 
interesting topic but one that would require alot of attention (and possibly 
money) to participate in fully.  Thanks for your attention to this.

I'm assuming you had conference call w/ AA on Friday re: the New Value 
Research Lab effort - is that correct? We are ready to regroup this week and 
hear the results of your conversation. Pls advise as to your feedback and

Thanks.

Yannis,

I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and
find that practically all the topics of the program are the
staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend 
money for this class.

If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it
by asking him to work on a research project.

Vince

Becky,

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
Overdyke),
oil trading and coal.

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

Vince

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

Frank:

I discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he said that, while we would be
glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
(they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. would be too time 
consuming for us at this time.  

You can go to www.lacimagroup.com and order the books directly.  Tell
them you are ordering the books for use at Enron and they should give you 
a 15% discount.

I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

As we had discussed in our phone conversation Friday, I would ask you to
order six copies of the newly Enron-published "Energy Derivatives" for
Paradigm Strategy Group.  We do the various derivatives training courses for
Enron, and this book will be required reading for all our instructors.

Please advise as to the total cost of the books.  If payment by check is OK,
please let me know to whom the check should be made payable.

You can reach me by e-mail, or phone at 281-360-7822.

Thanks for your help.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.=

the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netsca=

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC=20
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=
=20
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the=20
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new=20

contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, pleas=
e=20
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=
=20
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amoun=

federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=

our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20

record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=

The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =

consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager    $500/year
Director     $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions=

You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and=

Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of thei=

contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to=20
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to=

the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in=20
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the=20
limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution=
=20
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more=
=20
than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar=20
year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and=20

Vince,

I left you a voice message that explains a little about the history of this 
inquiry (you may want to refer to that first).

Please let me know what you know about this and your opinion.

Thank you,

Anthony,
Please contact Vince Kaminsky at ext. 3-3848.  I think his group has this 
type of training set up.  Ask him is you can be added to their classes.  Let 
me know if this works for you.

Hi, Gracie.

I'm just following up on my inquiry from last week.  Have you begun any 
discussions on Statistics classes?

Subject: Question about ERNIE

Gracie,

Does Enron have any statistics classes?  Ones more focused on basic 
statistics and the lingo (ex: alpha, beta, delta-gamma, Type I & II error, 
distributions, kurtosis, etc.) than the VaR class?

I have not seen any in the class schedule.  In working with traders and 
studying Risk Mangement concepts, even our "experts" that know almost 
everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem 
to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics!!!  This lack of 
knowledge basically makes my job as a Fundamentals Analyst (researching the 
underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing EGM/EA/EIM 
profits) very inefficient.

If they already do not exist, I recommend that ERNIE institute two types of 
statistics classes (which mirror the existing Finance class selection).  
"Introduction to Statistics" (perhaps a database approach - including 
application to Excel?) and "Applied Statistics" (which would be a more 
advanced approach that specifies how Enron uses - or should use - statistics 
in risk management marketing).

Please let me know what you think.

Cordially,

Anthony Sexton

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.

 I have recently come on board as Treasurer ,Enron India . Prior to joining , 
I was with Reliance Industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in India.
   The  Central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting 
corporates  to hedge their oil and other related risks. I believe the 
literature published
 by Risk in collaboration with Enron has come to be considered as an

As the Global VP/MD mid-year PRC draws closer, I want to take the opportunity 
to stress to you the importance of  updating your profile information in the 
GIS system.  Details on your current responsibilities, employment history, 
skills and education should have been updated by 7 July 2000.   For those of 
you that have not opened your profile in GIS, I urge you to do so as soon as 
possible to ensure that your profiles are current and complete.  

GIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  You may go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the GIS link, or just type eglobal.enron.com on 
the command line of the browser. 

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Hello Vince

I wanted to forward the following invitation to you.  We are putting the 
Technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the 
Analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have 
scheduled on Jan. 16th.  I wanted to forward to you as more of an FYI since 
we do not have any Cal Berkeley candidates starting on Jan. 8th.  Also - we 
are starting to set some of the events on campus for the Spring - so we 
should probably get together soon.  Please let me know what works best for 
you!

Thanks,

To the great and powerful Research Group:

As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  

I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.

Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.

Ted

p.s. - there is still lots of interesting opportunities to extend the 
paradigm

Enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned=20

conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented, decentralized manner=20

with the implementation of SAP and the profound explosion in=20

=20
significant cash savings to be extracted by the Company and also commercial=

potential for the formation of a highly profitable, business-to-business=20

Effective February 1, 2000, Enron will form a new Global Strategic Sourcing=
=20
unit.  This new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic=20
sourcing initiatives underway in the Gas Pipeline Group, Global Asset=20
Operations and Enron Corp.  Initially, Global Strategic Sourcing will focus=
=20
on aggregating Enron=01,s internal, joint venture and business partner dema=
nd=20
for products and services with the objective of creating a future=20
business-to-business e-Commerce venture.

It gives us great pleasure to announce that George Wasaff, Managing Directo=
r,=20
will lead this new global initiative.  George will report directly to Mike=
=20
McConnell, Chief Executive Officer for Global Technology.

George has been with Enron for fourteen years and has held many senior=20
executive positions, the most recent of which was Managing Director of ENRO=
N=20
South America's Wholesale Operations.  George was also the Interim Chief=20
Executive Officer of Elektro from July 1998 through June 1999 and Chief=20
Executive Officer of Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. ("TGS") from June=

1995 through February 1998.  George has also held numerous commercial=20
positions including Vice President and Country Manager, Mexico for Enron=20

Company.

Please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating=

George in his new role with the Company.

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for 
your participation.

Ken, Jeff and Joe

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

We are currently being billed for Freese Notis Weather.  I will need to 
allocate these charges to the appropriate cost center.  If you would like to 
continue this service I could allocate it directly to your cost center or 
send you the bill directly.  If you know of anyone else who uses this 
application please let me know and I will split the cost among the 
departments.

Subject: ENA Fileplan  

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we've 
taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA 
department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a 
vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project 
and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive 
to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The 
contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's 
record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping 
records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable 
and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what 
is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be 
maintained.

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use. 
The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into 
file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the 
contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=

current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja=

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20

Celeste,

As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.

The offer from Enron looks much better now. I have arranged for him
a number of different interviews (including one with you). I think we should 
not be too
punitive and give him the 2nd chance. I am setting up for him interviews with 
RAC,
EBS and Greg Whalley and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.

Please, give me a call if you have any other question.

Vince Kaminski

Vince,

I'm really feeling like a blind mouse about this because I haven't (nor has 
Christie, Mike and Mark) read Mr. Mehta's comments.  I believe that we would 
be better equipped to discuss the course of action that should be taken, if 
any, after we are well versed with Mr. Mehta and his perspectives.

Although, I do suggest that if we do decide to proceed, we should approach it 
by addressing the issues Mr. Mehta discussed under a different premise, i.e. 
sponsor a speaking engagement where one of the speakers' topics would be 
related to Mr. Mehta's topic - allowing us to strategically tell our side of 
the story without it appearing that this is a planned rebuttal.  We should 
specifically invite those who attended Mr. Mehta's engagement, but not limit 
it to this group.

Let's all discuss this once our group has read Mr. Mehta' comments.

Regard,


Cindy

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Cindy

Goodmorning Liz ,

Hopefully your morning is going well.

Liz, we are currently moving up to the 32nd floor
as you are already aware of.
I had been speaking with Brenda concerning
the move however , things has changed since then.

Liz , I need for you to understand the importance 
of me knowing exactly when and where we will move.

First of all - the space , we have several machines
that must move with us.

Secondly - We must make arrangements for our satellite ,
the cable may need adjusting.

Thirdly - I need to know where every copy machine is located
on the floor and hopefully we are closest to the largest one.

Please Liz, these are most important.
We prepare for morning meetings daily and we are the first to get 
here to work,  so if any problems occur we try and tackle them beforehand.

Please I know that you are very busy however , this will really be helpful
in making our move a success.

Maybe we can meet and discuss?

                                                                    Thank You

Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that 
may be too low, etc.

Celeste,

We need to make sure that the interns in Vince's group are coordinated and 
incorporated with the rest of the summer associates.  They should be offered 
the same starting dates, I believe they are May 22, 2000 June 5, 2000.  I am 
not sure about the June date.  Would you check and let Vince know.  They 
should also be offered the same starting salary package as the others.  They 
will be included in training (a few days) and any other events we host.
Thanks

Mark,

I want to ask you for a favor.

One of my associates, Stinson Gibner, is making a presentation to the MBA 
students at
Texas A&M University next week.

Do you have a Power Point general presentation about Enron, emphasizing our 
growth,
creativity and employment opportunities? We could use it for presentations
we make on campuses to business and science students. There are many 
presentations available on our Intranet site, but the are outdated.

It was nice meeting you in San Antonio.

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey

Yannis,

I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and
find that practically all the topics of the program are the
staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend 
money for this class.

If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it
by asking him to work on a research project.

Hi Vince,

I was not aware of the "Power Play" book tour.  I'll check it out.

As to the article with the Baylor professor, I think it's a great idea.  I'd 
like the University Affairs team to get involved.  If a visit is required, 
interviews, etc., they should coordinate.  That way, I think we'll have the 
greatest opportunity to leverage the relationship.

Mark

Mark,

Two points. 

1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power 
Play", is on a
tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a 
meeting last Sunday 
at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to
the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 
people attended.

2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to 
write jointly an
academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an 
article on EBS.
I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company 
Reinventing Itself.

I made a few points to John:

a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching
strategy developed by the management.

b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up 
with a term
"proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."

c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality
of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
empowerment.

d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and 
accomplishemnts.

The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate 
strategy
and would help greatly our recruiting efforts. 


Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key 
players. 
Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.

Vince

Shirley,

Bob will be reporting to Zimin Lu and primarily supporting ENA.   We will 
need to find a desk for him as well as set up his phone and PC  (can we use 
Ravi's?).   Elizabeth Grant (x57583) has handled him on the HR recruiting

Thanks,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Metal Bulletin - Iron and Steel Awards for 2000
Pushiest Entrant: Enron, the US commodity trading company, which promised it would revolutionize the steel business by offering futures in hot rolled coil via its online market place.

The EIM Fundamentals Analysis group is excited to announce that Dave Allan has joined as a Director, responsible for all Forest Products lines.  He comes to EIM with 20 years of experience in the Forest Products industry, of which 14 were spent at Abitibi and 6 with Pulp and Paper Week.  Please join us in welcoming Dave.

The Siebel Team ("The Force") continues to work towards program implementation of its customer management system in early May, with training to begin at the end of April.  Stay tuned for updates.

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.

Robert Johnston has asked me to charge Vince's department for 1/3 of the cost 
of the annual subscription to IIF.  The annual cost is $47K.  Therefore the 
cost for 1/3 is $15,666.67.  This information is for Maureen Raymond's use.

I will be happy to process the invoice for payment but in order for me to do 
so, I will need the proper coding for Vince's department.

Please let me know if you are agreeable to this.  If you have questions, you 
may wish to contact Robert Johnston directly at 3-9934.

Thanks,
Sharon

As you all may be aware the IT organization is undergoing significant 
organizational changes at a very rapid pace.  One of the groups that is being 
heavily affected is Purchasing, due to the large increase in the volume of 
requests and some staff turnover.  We realize that this is causing our users 
some pain and we are re-engineering the process as quickly as possible.  We 
will be communicating the changes to the process over the next few weeks.  We 
apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience in this regard.  
If you have any questions while the process is being adjusted please contact 
Bob Hillier at extension 3-0305.

The benefits don't justify the expense.

Hi Vince,

Winston is telling me that he has started a serious of presentations to 
certain members of your group to help everyone better understand the various 
components that have been documented.

How is that going from your perspective?......are your people getting 
anything out of it?

Also, the VaR documentation was completed last week, and I've just asked for 
a full printed copy of it to be created mand given to your department.

I've just engaged a small team to document the Credit Reserve model as a 
final piece and then we are done with the core documentation.

regards

Steve

We are still in discussions with MEC about a transaction, but it seems to be 
moving in the right direction.  They have asked to set up an advisory meeting 
in December to meet the senior team members.  Mr. Plotnick indicated that he 
expects to have his CTO in place by then.  I am trying to arrange our first 
meeting the week of December 5 or December 12.  Please send me a short list

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minute=

Good afternoon ladies,

I am working with Vince Kaminski, Director of Research, Enron Corp. and John 
Martin, Chair of Finance at Baylor University to schedule one hour time slots 
with Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow.  

Vince and John Martin are jointly authoring a 20-40 page paper, written in 
the style of a Harvard Business Review piece, about 'Transforming Enron 
Corporation as an Act of Managerial Will - The Value of Active Management'.  
Attached below you will find a brief outline of the proposed case study, 
although I have requested John Martin to provide us with the specific 
questions he will be asking all three participants.

We would like to schedule the one hour interviews on the following dates:

Monday, December 4th

Tuesday, December 5th

Week of December 11th


Please let me know at your earliest convenience which of the above-mentioned 
dates/times works best with everyone's calendar.  Thanks a million.

Thank you so much for reserving an Analyst for our group.   Tomorrow is my 
last day in Houston until I return from London in 2 months.  I won't forget 
something for your baby.  I've asked Gwyn Koepke and Vince Kaminski to

candidates prior to being employed in the Research Department.  I can 
interview over the telephone.  Could you please send us Mitra's resume.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Shelia Walton, HR, told me that my last day with my department will be June 
30.  Meanwhile I talked last week to EBS, EnronOnline, and EES.  I was most 
interested in the EES talk with Harold Buchanan who needs to know that he has 
the most complete list of potential customers and then information about 
those customers.

Any happenings from your talks?

Shirley,

Will you check with Vince on the support schedule for me?  I need to get the 
support to the BUs in order to get them to agree on the 2001 billing.  If you 
have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names 
and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me 
how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp 
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).  
Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore, 
they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001, 
which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call.  Thanx.

Vince,

I left a message with one of Yaron's roommates on Thursday afternoon for him 
to call ASAP for an interview on Sunday.  I guess he took the wrong number 
down but I do not understand this because the roommate read the number back 
to me and it was correct.  When I did not hear from Yaron I called on Friday 
and left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers.  I still did not hear 
from him and called again yesterday morning.  I finally received a call at 4 
pm yesterday but by that time my team and myself were half way back to 
Houston.  Sorry it did not work out.  I have a call into Charlene Jackson as 
to how she wants me to proceed and I will get back with you.

Kristin

Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone 
number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals. 
Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but 
he was in classes all morning and got the message in the  afternoon. I really 
appreciate your going out of your?way to help. Perhaps  there will be another 
opportunity.?

Thanks Susan:

However, Vince has not received his Financial Times at all this week.  I have
called everyday and they tell me they will send a recovery copy, but so far
we have not received one.  Is there anyway we could get a copy for him
today? 

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=

including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=

group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =

=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=

continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

Subject: ENA Analysts and Associates

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the=

l=20
now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North=

America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers=20
Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local=20
community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of=

Thanks and have a great day!

Hi Vince!

Maybe you remember me, my name is Andrew Miles and we worked together on a 
speech for Jeff Skilling this past July.  I am hoping that I can get on your 
calendar for 30 minutes next week.  I have been working with 3 other Enron 
employees for the past 6 months, developing a comprehensive innovation 
acceleration process for use by potentially all Enron employees - and we 
would really appreciate your input.  We have presented the idea to quite a 
few people in the company, and some outside of the company (Strategos 
Institute), all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input.  
Many people have suggested that we run the idea by you.

If you have some time next week, would you mind allowing me to explain our 
ideas to you?  I will follow up with a telephone call.

All the best,

Andrew
