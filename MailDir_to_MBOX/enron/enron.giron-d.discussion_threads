David, Will and myself have come up with a great team-building idea. We will 
pit all the risk groups against each other in a game of paintball as there 
are a number of people who would enjoy shooting each other with paint guns. I 
have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in 
identifying which would be the best for your respective groups.  

Option one: October 21 or 22
Option two:  November 18-19

Please report back to me as soon as possible so that I may reserve the 
facility. Thanks

Pat Ryder

We have a 7:30 shotgun start tomorrow morning.  We will have to pay and get 
out to our hole, so give yourself some time if you want to hit a few before 
we tee off.  We still need one more person.  Everyone else already had 
plans.  If you know of anyone who would like to play, invite them and let me 
know his name.  Unfortunaltey Jeff, you are the only guy who is any good.

West on Hwy 290
Pass the Beltway - Remember I said it's BFE
Exit Spring Cypress/Cypress Rosehill (About 12 miles past the Beltway)
Go thru 2 stop signs (First one is Spring Cypress-Second one is Cypress 
Rosehill)
After 2nd stop sign, make first right (there is not a stop sign at the 
intersection) - I believe the street is Cypress Chase
The road will dead end into a T
Make a left and the course is on the right - You can't miss it

I'll have my cell phone on if you get lost - 832-563-6328.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.

Jay,

I looked over the info you forwarded but have decided to just buy two mutual 
funds.  Unless you have a better suggestion, buy APGCX and MCGTX.  And I 
really mean it when I say if you have a better suggestion let me know.  It 
looks like the transfers worked properly.  But are the automatic purchases of 
mutual funds in place?  I don't see the activity on the web page.  Lastly, 
and I think this is just administrative stuff, Kristi's Roth IRA does not 
show up on the web or on the statements we receive in the mail.  Thanks.

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,
Mike

Arnold, can you please have these flat screens moved 11/02 morning.  I will 
mark them as complete on the next available churn.  Thank you.

Attached is the original churn that was submitted, the night that this was 
supposed to happen your people
were not able to switch the monitors out due to Bid - Week which is the 
busiest time of the month and my 
person was still working.  The person who came to move the monitors said that 
they would come back on
Monday or Tuesday and here it is Wednesday and nothing has been done.  If you 
could update me with some
type of information as far as when this will be taken care of that would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Greg,
I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really 
dissapointed in AR.

As discussed in the brown bag classes today many people would like to be able 
to see the NYMEX prices updated in real-time.  Attached is a modified TDS 
file that will listen to the NYMEX price.  When you open the file an error 
message appears but the file does work.  Just go to the listen page and you 
can see each of the months.  Please forward this file to your group if you 
feel it will be useful to them.  If you have any questions just ask.

Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?

Thanks,

Please review this internal candidate for your Risk positions.    His 
supervisor has ok'd him to search opportunities within Commercial Support.   
He has a good recommendation from his current supervisor. He is not 
comfortable on the commercial side.

Attached is the weekly credit file sorted and filtered as usual.  There are 
about 30 new 'No Physical Trade' deals out there since last week. A lot are 
with PG&E -- they have made another prepayment and we are allowed to trade 
(EOL only) with them again.

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

It looks like we need to be consistent in booking the GD spread deals.  Take 
a look at the example and please remember to book all future deals in a 
similar manner.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: Gas Daily "four leg" Booking

Hi Dutch,

I was hoping you could spread the word to the book admins regarding a data 
entry methodology requirement for Gas Daily 4 legged deals. The Confirms 
group is working with Ricky Dang to expand the logic and capabilities of 
their systems to accomodate automated confirms on deals done in the new 
format, but in order for this to work, it is critical that all Gas Daily 4 
legged deals entered manually into TAGG be booked in the same leg order as 
those which bridge automatically. Although the legs can technically be 
entered in any order as far as Risk is concerned, such deviations will cause 
failures from the confirm end. If the Gas Daily book admins can follow the 
same entry order used in deal # Q25289.1, .2, .3, .4 , the Confirms Group 
should be able to work with it from there. Just let me know if this will 
create any problems from your end. Thanks!

Torrey

Tim,

The document attached directly below this verbage is what I included to our 
risk folks as we discovered
that the way we were booking NSS was not correct.  Below this attachment is 
our risk director's independent
solution to the problem; you will note that it is the same conclusion that we 
(Richard and myself) came up with
(see the e-mail I sent at the very bottom of this e-mail).  

Hopefully this will help.

Kevin

Richard, Lee, and myself met this afternoon and reviewed the memo I prepared 
intending to find and propose a solution
to our existing valuation problem.   We think we have the answer.  We would 
appreciate any comments from our risk experts.

The following change to our existing deal is what we think will solve the 
problem.  All that we are doing is changing the fixed
price on Legs 2 and 3 to 0.  If you refer to the example mentioned in my 
earlier memo, you will note that the p/l attributable to 
this deals should be 52,777; by changing these legs to 0 we accomplish this 
end result.  

     

I look forward to any feedback any of you may have to offer.

What do you think about us starting to workout together regularly?  Either at 
night or in the mornings, but regularly and for the long term.  Maybe four 
times a week.  Running and some weights in the garage.  I would really like 
to start, even as hard as it will be, to make time for something like this.  
I love you.

Darron:

I understand from Chris Abel that the deals contained within this book were 
transferred to a new book.  Would that be the FT-Lonestar book recently 
created?  If so, did you calc and officialize the book one last time to 
insure that the positions are zeroed out for credit purposes?  If you did 
not, can you please do so.  You can make the effective date the 19th as that 
is the day the deals were moved to a new book.  It necessary for you to calc 
and officialize one last time as the Credit system looks back at the last day 
officialized to pick up credit information.  This will insure that duplicate 
datat is not present for credit.


Thanks for you help in this matter.


Regards,


Nancy

On second thought, it might be easier to allow the two books to have deals on 
any Central pipe.  We will make sure that the deals are on the correct 
counterparty (North or South)

Subject: New ENA - IM Mid Business Units

Darron, do you know which pipes these two new business units will be 
trading?  I need to make sure that all necessary pipes are mapped to these 
business units in order for traders to be able to book deals on them.  Let me 
know if there are specific ones they will be using or if they just need all 
pipes that are currently mapped to the ENA - IM Central business unit also 
mapped to these two new business units.

As discussed in the brown bag classes today many people would like to be able 
to see the NYMEX prices updated in real-time.  Attached is a modified TDS 
file that will listen to the NYMEX price.  When you open the file an error 
message appears but the file does work.  Just go to the listen page and you 
can see each of the months.  Please forward this file to your group if you 
feel it will be useful to them.  If you have any questions just ask.

Imelda,

Please change the subregion code for all ANR ML5 deals from Market to 
Midcon.  Also, the curve mapping needs to be changed as well.

 Intramonth IF-ANR/OK
 Mid Market IF-ANR/OK
 Gas Daily GDP-ANR/OK

If you have any questions, please call.  Also, will you please send me the 
latest version of the Central curve mappings.  Thanks.

Jay,

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some 
mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo 
Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.

  Little  Johnny  walked  into  his  dad's bedroom one day and found him
  sitting  on  the side of his bed sliding a condom onto his dick. In an
  attempt  to hide his full erection, Johnny's father bent over as if to
  look under the bed.


  Little Johnny asked curiously, "What ya doin', Dad?"


  His  father  quickly replied, "I thought I saw a rat go underneath the
  bed."


  Johnny replied, "What ya gonna do, fuck him?"

Darron,

I have setup the new pipe/zone  Wildhorse Energy Partners with WHEP/WHEP 
which Jackie requested.  I need to know how you would like this mapped.

Pipe  Zone  Mid-Market  Intramonth  Gas Daily
WHEP  WHEP      ???         ???       ???

Please let me know as soon as possible because the pipe is now ready for 
selection in SITARA.  I would like to setup the curve mappings before it is 
put into use.

Chao!

George, we need a new trade zone added for a new pipe (Wildhorse Energy 
Partners, LLC)

Pipe Code:   WHEP
Trade Zone: WHEP

The scheduler is Jaqueline Adams at X33918.  She agrees that the trade zone 
can be the same as the pipe code.

Please let me know as soon as this zone is added, so that I may get started 
on added all the meters.


Thanks,
Faye

> Instead of Astrological Signs, how about these .. What's Your Business

> 1) MARKETING
> You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid
> having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and
> socializing which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now.
> Least compatible with Sales.
>
> 2) SALES
> Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree."
> You are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and
> begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with customers
> so you can "concentrate on the big picture." You seek admiration for
> your golf game throughout your life.
>
> 3) TECHNOLOGY
> Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead
> content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace.
> Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying but who the hell can
> tell. It is written that Geeks shall inherit the Earth.

> 4) ENGINEERING

>
> 9) CUSTOMER SERVICE
> Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your

Kathy,

Attached are two files:  a mini-book of EC3952.O run for Nov-08 thru Oct-23 
and a copy of the deal in the transport model.  The file is too large to 
email.  There are two tabs:  the first contains deal terms and the second is 
a copy of the P&L sheet as of 12/4/2000.  Call me with any questions you may 
have.  Thanks for your patience.

Again this month, you are going to have to calculate your basis positions 
(officialize) twice.  Once for the TDS download, and once for the Benchmark 
for V@R.  For the TDS calc, all  (100% ) basis needs to show up for prompt 
month.  For the V@R calculations we will need to roll 50% of basis off 
tonight,  and 50% tommorrow.  I would recommend that you use two different 
post ID's to do this.  That way you can use your 100% calc for your curve 
shift report and it will reflect any change in prompt month index as curve 
shift and not a change deal.  We will need two calcs until indexes are set.  
Just to be clear,  calc your 100% basis calc first.  Officialize.  Load your 
positions into TDS. Unofficialize. Calc your 50% basis calc.  Officialize.  
Run all reports off of the 100% basis calc. 

Also,  we will roll-off 50% of all index positions (Gas Daily and Physical) 
tonight and roll-in 50% of physical and gas daily index.  And the other 50% 
tommorrow.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

First of all, congrats on the big win this weekend.  They keep proving me 
wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23

Subject: New Spreadsheet input


Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

If you guys want to go to WP, that is fine with me.  I will be able to go a

few weeks.

Diane,

The Chicago region is just me.  If you need my salary, let me know.  I travel 
to Chicago about once a month ($1,750/Trip).  I am a CPA so I like to take 
about 30 hours of classes per year.  I sincerely apologize about my 
tardiness.  Thanks so much for your help.

Believe me, I understand why you want him in your group.  But I lose Jennifer 
on Jan 24th and Chris on Jan 26th.  You have two months on one guy and six on 
the other.  I have 3 weeks on two people and Jason will be leaving soon 
because he is in the new trading track program.  I don't want to be an 
asshole, but I won't give him up unless I'm forced to.

Subject: WeaponX

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg

What to Expect From Gun Control

 these are the facts right out of the history books

 Interesting bit of information.





 "In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to

 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were

 rounded up and exterminated.



 "In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5

 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million

 Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million

 political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000

 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and

 exterminated.



 "Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000

 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.



 "Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one

 million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up

and exterminated."



 Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century

 because of gun control: 56 million.



 The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, ask them "Who do

 YOU want to round up and exterminate?" With guns, we are citizens. Without

 them, we are subjects.

Shelly,

I am looking for an Analyst to fill a position in Gas Risk Management.  I am 
the West Desk Controller and report to Jeff Gossett.  I think a Book 
Administrator role is a good position for an Analyst.  We have had success in 
with Analysts in our group.  I think it presents a good opportunity for them 
as well.  Please let me know how I can get on a list to talk with potential 
candidates.  I am ignorant of the process, so if I am presuming something 
incorrect, I would appreciate info on how this is supposed to work.  Thanks 
for your help.

Hey bunko gang...Unfortunately, Gary and I will be out of town that weekend.  
We are going on Gary's company's trip so we need to reschedule.  What do you 
guys think about September 30th?  Let me know who all can make it or suggest 
other dates that are more agreeable to your schedule!

Thanks,

Dawn

Jay,

I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously 
discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount 
transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 
from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA 
account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and 
account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let 
me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the 
recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will 
need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

DG

Subject: Gas Curves

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.


 






SIncerely,

Hi Jeff,

I'm hoping you're the person who takes care of this book.  If not, could
you please forward this message to the appropriate person.  There are
a few deals in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be moved to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS BOOK.  These are all EnronOnline deals so they
were put into this book automatically.

Q24809.1
Q47957.1
Q50596.1

Could you please tell everyone down there that books deals into Houston
books, to make sure that there aren't any ECC deals with counterparties
in these books.  Nymex closes today, and I'm going to have to start invoicing
on Monday, so I need to have all deals with ECC in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS
book by the end of today.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

Preliminary Summary Sheets were handed out yesterday afternoon for your 
review.  If needed, the OA group will be more than happy to reclassify 
variances(provided data such as forms, FRED's, etc. were provided by April 
30th) to the correct functional group until Thursday, May 3.

Due to issues which have arisen in the past regarding reclassifying variances 
the day before, or, in some cases, the day of the OA meeting, guidelines are 
being set to avoid the confusion of having multiple copies of the Summary 
Sheets handed out during the monthly meeting.  The final OA packet will be 
delivered on Friday, May 4.  If there are any questions, please feel free to 
call me @ 3-3954.  Thank you.

Darron, I believe you were ask about this last month.  it is still causing a 
pricing difference this month too.  Please call me so we can staighten out 
the deal or you can call Laura Scott in Canada and argue your point.  This is 
on open OA difference and will continue to be until you handle it.

I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.


Thanks, Jane

Lee, after I put in the deals, the system went down and I was not able to get

To run this file all that has to be done is enter the date and have the 
Portfolio and Book CD entered in also.
Information should only be entered into the yellow areas.

Let me know if any one has any questions.

I can't believe it is already time for our trip up to Kansas.  We are 
arriving on Thursday morning and returning on Sunday morning.  Other than the 
game on Saturday, we don't have any plans.  See you soon.

Scott,

These places carry the Onkyo receiver.  I don't think they carry Polk, but 
ask them who you should call for Polk speakers.  The place I got mine from a 
couple of years ago no longer carries them.  I'm still looking.  Lee's Audio 
& Video have the Onkyo listed at $629.  Their sight is at leesvideo.com

Happy Holidays!  It looks like we will be going skiing in Colorado from March 
11-16.  I wanted to see if you were going to be in town during that time and 
see if we could come by and see you.  It would most likely be on the 10th and 
then the 16th.  We are staying at a place from that Sunday night thru 
Thursday night.  Let me know.  I hope Santa was good to you all.

Bill,

I need to have FT-DENVER set up in TDS.  The trader is Jay Reitmeyer.  There 
are two Tagg books that need to be mapped to this:  FT-DENVER and 
INTRA-DENVER.  The following people in Risk need access to the book:  Darron 
Giron, Chris Walker, Pat Ryder, Jason Wolfe, Carole Frank, Anne Bike, and 
Jennifer Bagwell.  I also want it to roll up into ALL-WEST.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

To set up the Denver desk in TDS send a message to Bill Fortney with the 
following:

What to call it in TDS (it can be different than TAGG)
The names of the TAGG books to map to it
Who needs access
A roll up desk if needed.  Does it need to be added to ALL-WEST, have a 
different roll up or doesn't need a roll-up desk at all.

Any questions give me a call x5-7579 or Bill Fortney x3-9952

Eric,
I am afraid I have not made that much progress on my assignment.  I talked to 
ML Ruffer about the $1.2M basis swap.  She does not specifically know about 
the deal, but does know she gave between $1M and $2M to the West desk out of 
a reserve behind the scenes.  I don't know for sure, but this has to be how 
the $ got in the West P&L.  It is booked on 11/12/99 which is between 
EC3952.P (the annuity getting the unamortized $27M into the West desk) and 
EC3952.S (the annuity getting the $5M from Corp into the West desk).  I 
hadn't paid attention until just now, but Suzette Emmons booked the deal.  
She ran the transport book at that time.  

The physical buys from Canada (EC2208.11, EC3952.15, and EC3952.11) are 
booked correctly in Sitara.  EC3952.11 was changed by Kathy Reeves from 
ending in '08 to ending in '01 on 4/4/00.  However, the end date remains '08 
in Sitara.  I don't know why the term was changed.

I have meetings almost all day.  I will still try and investigate, but I know 
you were looking for some answers today.  You may want to try and get in 
touch with Suzette and see if she remembers the basis swaps.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your 
cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

> Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you

> Mrs. Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one,

> I want to empower those crying people to make their own

>
> Bush: The current administration had eight years to deal with that

OK, so the classes start this week.  The first one will be on what to look 
for in a P&L and MiniBench to prove reasonableness.  Will Kelly and I will 
present the class.  We have a few items we want to go over, but I think the 
most beneficial part will be individual questions.  So bring them if you have 
them.  We are have split the entire Risk team into two groups.  Our breakout 
is as follows:

 Group1   Group2
 Carole    Jennifer
 Jason    Anne
 Chris   

Group 1 will meet this Wednesday @ 11:30am and Group 2 this Thursday @ 
11:30am.  We will have Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  Thanks.

Jeremy,

Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.  I would like to 
move them all to the GD-NEW book.  I don't want to change any price or basis 
portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.  Please let me 
know if you can do this.  If you have any further questions, please call.  
Thanks.

I want to run something by you.  It sounds like we have some sort of budget 
for Friday night.  I would like to offer everyone the opportunity to bring 
someone with them but also explain that we may not be able to pay for it 
all.  I guess the reason is I would like to have Kristi come with me, but am 
willing to pay for her.  I would like to do the same for everyone else, but 
don't want to offend anyone with the possibility that they may have to pay a 
little $$.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Subject: Suggested Improvements for OA

Here is a list by group of suggested improvements for OA.  I will arrange a 
meeting to discuss how we can implement these quickly.  The groups with few 
suggestions are not doing everything correctly,  I  just got fewer to no 
responses out of those groups.  Please thank the people in your groups that 
responded.  I appreciate your help in improving this process.

Thanks,

Jeff

Uncle Clark,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

Darron

Hi Jeff,

Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals
that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current 
list of
all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message
on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution
to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books
that need to be flipped.

Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your
help on this.

Stacey

best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20

us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=

athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=

ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=

resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=

the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=

Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =

that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=

loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20

rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=

=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=

football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=

Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=

 the=20
number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.=
=20
how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players =
in=20
the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20
example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=
=20
Bay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and=
=20
Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20
Vikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,=

here is the list as provided by the Big 12:

=09Hodges Mitchell =20
=09
=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=
=20
with opponent's wideouts.
=09
=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=
 all=20
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=
s=20
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=
n=20
anyone at UT block?
=09
=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=
es=20
the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=
n=20
up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=
y=20
against?=20
=09?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=
=20
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=
=20
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=
=20
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=
. I=20
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =
in=20
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=
=20
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=
y=20
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=
=20
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=
=20
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20
=09?? Ernie McAnally=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=
e.=20
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=
d=20
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=
s=20
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=
n=20
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=
re=20
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=
s=20
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=
nd=20
the next two years, he should only get better.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=
=20
announcers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f=
or=20
LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20
Williams' run for the Heisman?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=
=20
postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20
media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than=
=20

=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi=
s=20
teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost=
=20
four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20
officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=
=20
abundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20
recruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie=
s=20
to go with those recruiting victories. =20
=09?? T. Hough=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=
n=20
stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20
Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20
programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=
n=20
the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam=
es=20
in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20
=09
=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20
faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot=
=20
seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=
s=20
done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=
s=20
first two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20
school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20
addition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha=
n=20
probably most Texas fans realize.=20
=09
=09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C=
arr,=20
Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t=
he=20
eyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha=
t.=20
UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,=
=20
even when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge=20
expectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti=
ng=20
out the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20
=09?
=09

=09?? Marty Bonner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe=

against Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said=

the loss to Stanford?=20
=09?? Virginia Blair=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: "I said during the pre-season tha=
t we=20
were overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished=
=20
last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a=

Top 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv=
e=20
a tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people wa=
nt=20
to push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that positi=
on=20
and expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult gam=
e=20
at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think=

Any word on a stock for Carley's custodial account?  Also, I would like to 
talk about selling the Dell in my IRA and diversify some.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'm in Chicago and am returning on Friday afternoon.  I can check 
my email.  Thanks.

I have a friend who is looking to change employers.  He is in the IT field.  
I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.  Although, he would be 
interested in any similar job.  I will attach his resume.  What is the best 
way to get his resume in front of the proper people?  I would appreciate your 
opinion.  I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron 
that does.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Stephanie,

We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July 
1.  To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid 
Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.  It would be helpful if we could 
have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but 
all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.  The two traders 
involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.

 Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South
 Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this 
request.  Thanks for your help.

Hi guys --

Hopefully these curves are covered between the three of you!  Attached are 
the 10 curves reviewed for the month of February.  Of these 10, the curves in 
question are:

NGI-PGE TOPOCK
IF-HEHUB
IF-VALERO TX
IF-NNG TOK
IF-TW PERMIAN
IF-TRANSCO Z1
IF-TENN Z5

If you could, please identify the factors that are driving their drastic 
changes in shape and seasonality as compared to the prior month.  Please do 
not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Subject: TW transportation index hedges entered into 1/2001

Thanks for your assistance and that of Jeff.   In addition to the 8 trades 
sent yesterday (see below), which Jeff is assisting on the offsetting 
positions, we have another done on March 7, 2001  ticket # QV8401.1, please 
add it to the list.

At year end Ron Baker worked with your group to document the offsetting third 
party positions on the following trades.

NI8156.1
NK4742.1
NT6154.1
NV5358.1


I understand that as a result of that work about 97 third party trades were 
identified to offset these 4 Transwestern trades.  Somehow an effectiveness 
test was done.  We were not involved in any of that work and I hope all 97 
trades (If that is the correct number) are still on ENA's books and are still 
effective.  At this time I don't see how I can measure effectiveness without 
the third party positions in our books.  Can ENA met the effectiveness 
standard and measurement requirements of SFAS 133 or is it the responsibility 
of the business unit that originated the hedge.  At this time we are only 
measuring our own positions.   Roger, indicated in the below memo that Ernie 
was going to do the effectiveness testing.   

We need your advice on if we should continue hedging positions with ENA.  I 
am concerned that ETS does not have the ability to monitor and maintain 
effectiveness when ENA facilitates the transaction because ETS loses control 
of the offseting 3rd party position.   I was under the impression that 
intercompany trades were kept in an affiliate book.  Perhaps we can get 
together next week and work out documentation procedures and the use of the 
affiliate book.  Anyday except Monday. 

Thanks,  Dan

Jeff,

I hope you can help me with this.  I need to find a way to identify 
offsetting 3rd party derivative transactions relating to the internal trades 
done with TW for the following deals:

TW RMTC QL2915.1
TW RMTC QL2918.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL5424.1
TW RMTC QL5444.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL5357.1
TW RMTC QL5358.1
  
  
TW RMTC QL9270.1
TW RMTC QL9273.1

Tiffany Miller identified you as the person that did this for our deals with 
ENA earlier.  Please let me know as soon as possible, if you can help.  If 
not, do you have any suggestions?

Vince

Dan/Bob,
Following my voice mail message (to Dan), I want to circle back on the 
accounting impact of the recent internal transportation derivatives between 
TW and RMTC.

The concern that has arisen is that TW has taken the "out-of-the-money" 
impact of these trades (approx. $27MM) to OCI while RMTC has marked the 
"in-the-money" impact through income.

TW has taken its impact to OCI because it is, on a standalone accounts basis, 
designating these internal trades in cash flow hedge relationships.

However, from an Enron consolidated financial position viewpoint, the 
internal trades cannot be designated as hedges (and, thus, would need to be 
reversed which would have a negative impact on earnings of $27MM).

So, in order not to have this negative impact, 3rd party "offset" 
transactions in ENA must be identified and documented as cash flow hedge 
transactions.

It may be that RMTC has already identified offsetting 3rd party derivative 
transactions relating to the internal trades done with TW. 

However, if not, we think that the best place for responsibility for getting 
these 3rd party trades IDENTIFIED AND PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN CASH FLOW HEDGE 
RELATIONSHIPS is with the business unit that wanted the internal trade in the 
first place - i.e. TW in this case.

If this has not already been done, can you have someone in your shop work 
with ENA to identify and obtain copies of sufficient 3rd party trades that 
hedge the risk hedged by TW. Once this is accomplished, Enron Corp. 
consolidated hedge documentation needs to be established as a matter of 
urgency; again, we consider this responsibility is best placed in the BU 
using the internal trade as a hedge. In this regard, Ernie (effectiveness 
testing) and I will be available to assist with this documentation.

Please do not hesitate to advise comments or questions on this matter. I am 
preparing the FAS 133 impact 3/31 Pro-Formas based on the identification and 
development of the consolidated hedge documentation.

Roger

This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your 
books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a 
third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today.  
Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked 
correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important 
for February and March 2001 deals.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I 
will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on 
the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded 
under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL 
Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than 
that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233.

Thanks-Steve Richman

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Subject: Canadian deals in US books.

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

I saw that about Mackovic - He's a good fit in the Pac10.  Who do you take in 
the Orange Bowl?  FSU is -11.  That sure seems like alot of points.

Drew,

Here is Agave for June.  I also made a change to May.  I was calculating the 
differential off of the wrong location index.

Kathy,
I tried calling but could not get you or your voicemail.  Tomorrow is the 
first day of bidweek and I also have some other meetings to attend.  I think 
we need to skip this week and pick up next Tuesday.  Sorry for the 
inconvenience.

It seems as if I have caused some confusion.  Last night's email attachment 
was the P&L that did not include People's or Origination's share of the 
total.  Currently attached is the P&L that was signed off on last night.  If 
you have any questions, please call.

Relations Dept at many of  the major corporations today. It helps them get a
better insight concerning their employees and potential employees.

It's only 10 simple questions, so...  Grab a pencil and paper, keeping track
of your letter answers.   Make sure you change the subject of the e-mail to

Now add up the total number of points.
OVER 60 POINTS:
Others see you as someone they should "handle with
care." You're  seen
as
vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.
Others may admire
you,
wishing they could be more like you, but don't always
trust you,
hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.




 51 TO 60 POINTS:
Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather
impulsive
personality; a natural leader, who's quick to take
decisions,  though not
always the  right ones. They see you as bold and
adventuresome, someone
who will try anything once; someone who takes chances
and enjoys an
adventure.  They enjoy being in your company because
of the excitement you
radiate.

41 TO 50 POINTS:
Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing,
practical, and
always interesting; someone who's constantly in the
center of attention,
but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to
their head. They also
see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
someone who'll always
cheer  them up and help them out.

31 TO 40 POINTS:
Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &
practical. They see you
as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest... Not a
person who makes
friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's
extremely loyal to
friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in
return. Those who
really get to  know you realize it takes a lot to
shake your trust in your
friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to
get over it if
that trust is ever broken.

21 TO 30 POINTS:
Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They
see you as very
cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady
plodder. It'd really
surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or
on the spur of the
moment,  expecting you to examine everything carefully
from every angle
and then, usually decide against it. They think this
reaction is caused
partly by your careful nature.

UNDER 21 POINTS:
People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,
someone who needs
looking after, who always wants someone else to make
the decisions & who
doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything.
They see you as a
worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.
Some people think
you're boring. Only those who know you well know that
you aren't.

Now forward this on to everyone you know, making sure
to put YOUR score
in the subject box.

Subject: Killing physical deals

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

I would like to get a copy of the supporting reports for both the IM-Denver 
and FT-Denver books on a daily basis.  Please include relevant curveshifts, 
new deal reports, change deal reports for the firm book, and curveshift, new 
deal reports, change deal reports, revenue and expense comparisons, and top 
page (desk level summary).  Also I would like a breakdown of the demand, 
commodity and other expense figures and any revenue, reimbursement that will 
go in for the first of the month.

Also, I would like an explanation as to how the IM-Denver book lost nearly 
$400,000 over the last two days.  

Thank you,

Jay

I have encountered the following problems calcing at home.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

Dave

This author of this little story should go to Washington.

"A Republican and a Democrat were walking down the street when they came to
a homeless person. The republican gave the homeless person his business card
and told him to come to his business for a job. He then took twenty dollars
out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person.

The Democrat was very impressed, and when they came to another homeless
person, he decided to help.
He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare
office. He then reached into the Republican's pocket and gave him fifty
dollars."

It may be hard for some people to figure out the real differences between
Democrats and Republicans, and this little story says it all.

Hi again Darron

Here are some more deals that need to be flipped out of the G-DAILY-EST book,

QC3611.1
QC4110.1
QC4394.1
QC4496.1
QC4506.1

Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals 
between ECC and another counterparty.  These need to be fixed right away this 
morning as I need to invoice and settle them today.  Please call me if you 
aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on 
to the person who does.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

Hi Darron,

I'm not sure if this message is to go to you, and if it needs to go to 
someone else could you please forward it to them, but there are several deals 
in the MGMT-WEST book that need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book in 
the morning.  

Q88422.1
Q87046.1
Q87271.1
Q87419.1
Q92337.1
QB4026.1
QB4210.1
QB4991.1
QB5037.1
QB5039.1
QB5129.1
Q87016.1

These are all December deals with companies that ECC has master swaps with, 
and I should be settling them all on Friday December 8th.  Could you please 
make sure that there aren't any more deals with ECC and a third counterparty 
in this book as it messes up invoicing and settlement.

Please call me if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

Darron,

Could you tell me what my unaccounted balance is as well.  I am working with 
Cora P to make it zero.  Also could you email the P&L number to 
jhsim@juno.com.


Thanks Darron,
I'm just alittle nervous.  I am flying solo and it was a big number.  Almost 
too good to be true.

Regarding the attached. . .

Paul-
I made edits to the document, but I have asked Jeff Sorenson to review the 
Confirmations piece, and I asked Darron Giron to review the Settlements 
piece.  Darron will coordinate the return of the document to you.  

Darron,
I made edits, and it is saved in O: Erms\1intra\Central\Transaction Flow 1.  
Please review (especially Settlements), make changes as necessary.  When Jeff 
gets his edits to you, please incorporate his Confirmations changes, and 
forward to Paul.

Jeff,
Once you have reviewed, please forward your changes to Darron Giron.  He will 
incorporate and forward to Paul.

I will be out of the office Mon-Thur next week, and I will return on Friday.  
Paul-please let Jeff and Darron know what sort of timeframe you are looking 
for. . .  If you all have a better way to coordinate, go for it!

Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: WeaponX

I would like each of your book admins using WeaponX to begin using the 
following procedures at least once/week (if they aren't already).

Open the database while holding down on the shift key.  This will open the 
database, but prevent the main form from opening automatically.  Next, the 
admin should go to Access menu selections and choose Tools/Database 
Utilities/Compact Database.  After the database has completed compacting, you 
can use the database as normal.

Just a quick explanation:

This is standard procedure for Access databases.  WeaponX imports and deletes 
a lot of data on a daily basis.  When data is deleted, the space is not freed 
up that was used by the data.  Therefore, as time goes by, the database size 
grows and grows and needs to be periodically compacted.

The Texas WeaponX file that I compacted reduced from 520 MB to 30 MB and one 
for the west went from 400 MB to 12 MB.  You can see that we will save 
several GB if everyone begins compacting the databases on a regular basis.

Please note:  Even though this is standard Access procedure, I would 
recommend that the book admin save a copy of their existing WeaponX file 
prior to compacting for the first time.  Once the file is compacted and a 
daily run has been successful, they can delete the backup file.  It is not 
necessary for them to save a backup copy each time before compacting.  I am 
only recommending it for the first compact.

I don't anticipate any problems with this procedure.  As a matter of fact, 
Crystal (East desk I believe) already compacts the database on a daily 
basis.  In addition Ann (West desk) ran a test for me with no problems.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Greg

If possible, I would like to use these two names:

Subject: Physical Deals

Please make sure that all physical deals with a finacial component are marked 
physical in TAGG.  Mostly this applies to annuities associated with physical 
deals and imbedded options.   Not clicking physical is causing problems with 
accounting as well as the credit group.

Thanks

Can you tell me if the gas expense for Harbor Cogen is being booked to 
company 553?  Can you tell me what is happening with this?

I don't have any of the TAGG specifics, but the trader here says it is 
approximately $(5M).   Supposedly, the individual in Gas Settlements that has 
been making the manual entries each month is Vivien Pham....we (Power)  just 
aren't seeing it flow through to us to record to our dpr.  Maybe she has some 
info that would help us all?!

I'm looking into it.  I tie out each month with the gas desks on our 
liquidations. So whatever has liquidated out of TAGG is what gets booked.  I 
haven't noticed the West desk being off in there liquidations.  Do you which 
gas desk/book this should be with?  Do you have amounts or deals numbers?

Tracy,

The West Power desk has been involved in a deal since last July whereby we 
(Power Desk) run a generator for a third party (Harbor Cogen) with gas we 
purchased from the Houston gas desk.  Here is my question....have you ever 
seen an entry booked by the gas desk charging West Power for the gas cost 
because West Power has never recorded this gas cost?!  The gas book name for 
West Power is EPMI West Coast if that helps.

Thanks.
Casey

We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

Hi guys,

Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that 
still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today.

FT-CENT     

QU4059.1

FT-NORTHWEST



FT-ONTARIO



FT-WEST



GD-CENTRAL



NG-EXOTIC

QY3631.1

NG-PRICE



These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking 
for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If 
you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your 
help

Stacey

Hi Jeff,

Just to let you know that there are a few deals that need to be
moved to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before the end of 
Thursday this week, as they need to be invoiced from the 
Canada office.



Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  

Thanks so much for your help.

How are you feeling?  I'm very tired and stiff.  I've been thinking, and I 
know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes 
to $.  So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes 
to financing.  I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.  
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know 
that I value your judgement and ideas.  Have a great day.  As always, I love 
you very much.

I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was 
going to be free on Saturday.  My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on 
Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.  
In other words, BFE.  $70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.  He 
will have a keg.  There will be prizes for the winners.  It is a four man 
best ball scramble.  Tee time is early:  7:30am.  I sent this to guys I 
either know play or think play.  If you have someone else in mind, feel free 
to forward the message.  I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if 
anyone was interested.  Let me know.

Darron,

I met this man's wife, Nadia Rodriquez, in orientation.  Here is what she 
said about her husband's work experience.

"My husband just finished his MBA and his company's moving to Atlanta.  He 
has been offered two positions there but we would rather stay here.  His 
background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance 
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects 
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a 
broker with PaineWebber.  Also, he has extensive computer skills and is used 
to dealing with all levels of personnel."

She should be sending me his resume soon.  

Carole

Jennifer,

Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question 
for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.  Let me know if you have 
any further questions.

Jeff --

Before I send out the memo for January, I have a few questions about 3 curves 
that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the 
10 curves that were validated for January.  The ones I'm asking you to take a 
look at are:

1)  NGI-SOCAL -- Why the upshift for the entire curve compared to prior 
month?  Why has the shape of the curve changed from (approximately) 1/1/04 
forward compared to the curve from prior month?

2)  IF-MONCHY -- What factors account for differences between the 1/31/01 
curve vs. the 12/29/00 curve for the period between 1/1/01through 1/1/07?

3)  IF-TRANSCO Z3 --  What factors account for the entire curve changing so 
dramatically from last month to this month?



Thanks for your help.

Jennifer

Susan,

Attached is the completed book request form.  I just want to clarify a few 
things.  The first three books are for Tagg.  The last two are for Sitara.  I 
will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.  Do you do 
this?  Or can you point me in the right direction.  I really need this 
completed by the end of the week.  Let me know if there is something else I 
need to do.  Thanks for your help.

DG    3-9573

Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Sorry for the wide distribution.  However, I thought all my hunting buddies 
should be aware of what's going on.  Who knows we may be asked to register 
sling shots in the future.

Thanks

Hector,
I don't believe I am set up to review as a supervisor in the PEP system.  How 
do I get this changed in the system?  Let me know.  Thanks

This deal was EOL ID 520766 on the 25th.  Neither the Sitara or EOL number is 
in Tagg.  Please update the deal with the EOL and Sitara number.  It is very 
important that you always put this information in Tagg.  In addition, make 
sure you are updating Sitara with the Tagg numbers as well.  Thanks.

I thought you might like this.  Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?  I don't 
think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.  We pretty much rule 
anyone out without prior experience unless they are internal candidates.  
However, I have forwarded her resume to Settlements and Volume Management.  I 
think she should get a call from them.  How's life in Dallas?  Also, what is 
your new cell number.  The Houston Cellular number no longer works.

????????A shepherd was herding his flocks in a remote pasture when 
suddenly a brand new Jeep Cherokee advanced out of a dust cloud towards him. 
The 
driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and a 
YSL 
tie leaned out of the window and asked our shepherd: "If I can tell you 
exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?" 

The shepherd looks at the yuppie, then at his peacefully grazing flock and 
calmly answers "sure!" 
The yuppie parks the car, whips out his notebook, 
connects it to a cell-phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet where he 
calls 
up a GPS satellite navigation system, scans the area, opens up a database and 
some 60 Excel spreadsheets with complex formulas. Finally he prints out a 150 
page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer, turns round to our shepherd 
and 
says: "You have here exactly 1,586 sheep!" 

"This is correct. As agreed, you can take one of the sheep" says the 
shepherd. He watches the young man make a selection and bundle it in his 
Cherokee. 

Then he says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is, 
will you give me my sheep back?" 

"Okay, why not" answers the young man. "You are a consultant" says the 
shepherd. 

"This is correct" says the yuppie, "How did you guess that?" 

"Easy" answers the shepherd. "You turn up here although nobody called 
you. You want to be paid for the answer to a question I already knew the 
solution to. And you don't know shit about my business--? you took my dog."

Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that this deal needs to be flipped to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away as all Dynegy Canada deals
need to settle with ECC, not ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey

Jim,

I didn't top level that amount tonight.  The Central desk has the other side 
of the transaction and if I backed your portion out, then the loss would be 
double counted.  It will correct itself tomorrow.

As part of our monthly testing we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L 
Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review 
additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have 
identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the 
last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we 
have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the 
drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
comments.

Thank You,

My niece sent this today...got a good laugh from it!

Liz

A lady stopped unexpectedly by her recently married son's house.  She rang
the doorbell and stepped into the house to see her daughter-in-law standing
naked by the door.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"I am waiting for my husband to come home from work," the daughter-in-law
replied.
"Why are you naked?" asked the mother-in-law.
"This is my love dress," the daughter-in-law replied.
"LOVE DRESS! You're naked," said the mother-in-law.
"But my husband loves it when I wear this dress. It makes him happy and he
makes me happy," said the  daughter-in-law "He will be home any minute now,
so perhaps you could stop by a little later?"
Soured by all of this romantic stuff, the mother-in-law left.
On the way home, she thought about the "LOVE DRESS" and got an idea. She
undressed, showered, applied her best perfume, and waited by the door for
her husband to come home.
Finally, his pickup truck drove up the drive way. Her husband opened the
door, and immediately saw his naked wife.
"What are you doing?" he asked.
"This is my love dress." She said, excitedly.
"Needs ironing." He replied.

I totally forgot about the weekly meeting.  Sorry.  Like I said yesterday, 
I'm working on getting new books set up for Chicago.  I just need to 
follow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also 
working on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next 
Tuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, 
and liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the 
Trunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain 
the deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the 
meeting today.

Subject: Re: TDS Position Flag

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,

Bill:

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

Subject: Re: TDS Position Flag  

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

QC3611.1
QC4110.1
QC4394.1
QC4496.1

Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals 
between ECC and another counterparty.  These need to be fixed right away this 
morning as I need to invoice and settle them today.  Please call me if you 
aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on 
to the person who does.

Thanks for your help

Subject: desk level summaries

could you please forward this to your intra-month book admins.
Thanks



The OA group has had many problems in the past with our desk level summaries 
and the break-outs between our books.  Some of the short names get cut off 
and it is hard to tell exactly what books they belong to.  Could you please 
make sure that the values are input on the correct lines, that there is only 
one line per desk and that there are no numbers without a desk assigned to 
them.  Some of the problems they have run into with SAP and the "seller 
rules" is that if both desks do not show the same numbers the seller side is 
assumed to be correct which throws off the other side and gives them an 
adjustment for the desk to take which isn't always correct.   

Here is a list of the desks that are most often misused.

ECT-ENA - IM CE  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MI  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MK  central desk
ECT-ENA - IM MA  market east deak
ECT-ENA - IM SI  sithe desk
ECT-EMW - IM MI  enron midwest desk


Please pay special attention to your numbers this month.  Getting this 
corrected up front will take care of a lot of work in the future. 
Please ask me if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Kam

Just a quick reminder to please go into your books and flip all the ECC deals 
to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today for both January and February 
start dates.

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in 
TAGG, so please see her if you have questions on this.

Please let me know when all the January deals have been fixed so I can start 
the invoicing process.  

Thanks for your help.

Subject: FW: Does your school qualify?


A school either is or it isn't. 
> Alabama is. 
> Notre Dame is. 
> Ohio State is. 
> Michigan is. 
> Texas is. 
> USC is. 
> Missouri thinks it is but is not, Minnesota was but is no longer, 
> Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of "is" is, Rice never was 
> and Temple will never, ever be. 
> We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college 
> football program. 
> Mind you, this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses. 
> Colorado won a national title in 1990 but is not a program; Ohio State 
> has not won one since 1968 but is. 
> Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business, as much 
> about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent. 
> Can we whistle your fight song? 
> Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight? 
> Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding 
> stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance? 
> Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to 
> the front door? 
> If you answered yes, yes, yes and yes to the above, you are likely a 
> program. 
> You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it 
> up in the South, where the "War of Northern Aggression" has provided 
> more than four score and seven years worth of motivation. 
> When Georgia (program) beat Michigan (program) at Ann Arbor in 1965, 
> fans deluged the Bulldogs upon their return to Athens. 
> "It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again," former 
> Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnhart's new 
> book, "Southern Fried Football." 
> What does it take to make our varsity? 
> National titles factor in and tradition is a must, but there is much 
> more to it than that. 
> A program must go the extra yard. 
> Any school willing buy out a head coach's contract, no matter the 
> length or the amount, is a program. 
> Any school that keeps recruiting a player it can't get just to keep a 
> rival school's top recruiter on the case is a program. 
> You probably also qualify if: 
> * The square footage of your school's weight room is roughly equal to 
> that of your town's municipal airport. 
> * You think the 85-man scholarship limit is a communist plot. 
> * You contribute money to only two sports: football and spring 
> football. 
> * You publicly support Title IX but privately think it has set your 
> boys back 20 years. 
> * Hollywood has made a movie involving the program. "Rudy," "Big 
> Chill," "Something For Joey," "Everybody's All-American," "The Spirit 
> of West Point," "Hold 'em Navy," "The Bear," "Knute Rockne, All 
> American," "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." 
> * Your school annually ranks in the preseason top 10 no matter how 
> many starters it has coming back. 
> * Your head coach could run for Congress and win in a landslide. 
> * They name city streets after your coaches and players. 
> * The chief of police keeps mug photos of your players in his top 
> drawer. 
> * Your head coach leads practice with a megaphone, from a tower. 
> * You have a living mascot (UGA, Mike the Tiger, Bevo); although this 
> does not guarantee enshrinement (see "Ralphie" at Colorado). 
> To what length will you go for your program? 
> Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent 
> running free down the sideline, a la Alabama's Tommy Lewis against 
> Rice's Dickie Moegle in the 1954 Cotton Bowl? 
> * Are you arrogant enough (pay attention here, USC and Notre Dame) to 
> keep scheduling top 10 opponents because you believe in your heart you 
> are one national television victory from getting back in title 
> contention? 
> You get program bonus points if you had a coach or player nicknamed 
> "Shug," "Bump," "Rip," "Gus," "Bear," "Bubba," "Duffy," "Muddy." 
> Notable exceptions: Orin "Babe" Hollingbery at Washington State and 
> Texas El Paso's "Cactus Jack" Curtice. 
> You are a program if you can overlook your head coach's scandalous 
> extramarital affair as long as he defeats Auburn. 
> You are probably a program if you've had 10 or fewer coaches in the 
> last 100 years. 
> Since 1950, for example, Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and 
> Joe Paterno, who have amassed a combined record of 421-131-7. 
> Penn State is a program. 
> Lastly, and this is very important--it can make or break a program. 
> Are you willing to accept NCAA sanctions as a reasonable condition for 
> winning a national title? 
> This factor alone tipped the University of Washington off the program 
> fence. 
> You are likely not a program if: 
> * You produce boatloads of NFL players but can't sell out home games. 
> * You sell your tickets to the Rose Bowl when your team is in it. 
> * Your marching band is banned from playing at a game but your team 
> isn't. 
> * You sell your home game to an opponent for financial considerations. 
> 
> * Your arena is named after a basketball coach, but the football 
> stadium is named after a philanthropist. 
> * You play in a conference that ends with any combination of the 
> letters U, S and A. 
> * You play in a domed stadium. 
> * Your most famous football player made his name in baseball. 
> * You ripped your fight song off from Nebraska and changed the words. 
> The list: 
> (Program note: If your school is not among the following, you are most 
> likely a rat for the NCAA.) 
> 
> The Programs 
> NOTRE DAME: The whole nine yards. Equal parts love, hate, hype, 
> history, myth combined now with first-ever NCAA sanctions! They ought 
> to make several movies. 
> ALABAMA: Bear Bryant left Texas A&M (program) in 1958 to return to 
> Tuscaloosa. Asked why, Bear said, "Mama called." 
> MICHIGAN: You are a program when your Sept. 16 game at UCLA can be 
> written off as a "West Coast recruiting trip." 
> NEBRASKA: The "American Gothic" of programs: The media guide cover 
> could be a standing shot of a plow, pitchfork, sickle and blocking 
> sled. 
> TEXAS: It matters not that the Longhorns haven't claimed a national 
> title in 30 years, because the eyes of Texas are always upon them. 
> Remember, it was Darrell Royal who taught the Wishbone to Bear Bryant. 
> 
> OHIO STATE: Brigham Young leads Ohio State, 1-0, in national titles 
> since 1968, but we're not even checking the Buckeyes' ID at the door. 
> Great band, fight song, stadium, uniforms, tradition. 
> OKLAHOMA: A former OU president in the Bud Wilkinson era said his goal 
> was to build a university to make the football team proud. Slimier 
> than crude oil in the days under the bootlegger's son, Barry Switzer, 
> otherwise known in Norman as "the glory years." 
> TENNESEE: These people are sick. If they don't stop this crazy 
> attendance war with Michigan, Neyland Stadium in 10 years is going to 
> be taller than the Eiffel Tower. 
> PENN STATE: For 50 years, in an isolated hamlet, Joe Paterno has 
> dominated opponents, the tube sock industry, genetics, fans and the 
> media. 
> USC: Hmmm. Hasn't won a national since '78. Hasn't produced a Heisman 
> winner since 1981. But, as "Tusk" bandmates Fleetwood Mac put it in 
> the banner years: "Don't stop thinking about tomorrow." 
> FLORIDA STATE: Only a man of Bobby Bowden's clout could 
> single-handedly transform the former Florida State College for Women 
> into a program. Phyllis Diller never underwent this kind of face lift. 
> 
> GEORGIA: UGA! They play ball "between the hedges," bury deceased 
> mascots in the end zone, bark like dogs on kickoffs. The women dress 
> to the "9s" on game days and the men wear ties. What more needs to be 
> said? 
> AUBURN: We seek consistency in a program. The 1957 national title team 
> under Shug Jordan was not allowed to play in a bowl because of NCAA 
> violations. Terry Bowden's 1994 unbeaten squad was bowl-ineligible for 
> infractions incurred under Pat Dye. 
> MIAMI: Last sentence in our Psych 101 exam paper on the subject: "Not 
> even a blip on the program radar screen until the 1980s, when three 
> coaches led the school to four national titles with a renegade, 
> counter-culture bravado that challenged and pistol-whipped established 
> program morays as previously defined by Notre Dame." 
> CLEMSON: Years ago a guy hauled a hunk of rock from Death Valley back 
> to South Carolina and stuck it in the east end of Clemson Memorial 
> Stadium. It is now tradition for players to rub "Howard's Rock" on 
> entry to the field. 
> This gem is right out of "The Program" handbook. 
> LOUISIANA STATE: A program, so help us Billy Cannon. In 1934, Huey 
> Long heard sales for a home game were lagging because Barnum and 
> Bailey were in town. Long found an obscure state law prohibiting 
> animals to be washed on Saturday and canceled the circus. 
> MICHIGAN STATE: A tough call, but in the end we invoked our "name" 
> clause, which states: Any school that has been coached by a "Muddy" 
> and a "Duffy," and had a star player named "Bubba," shall henceforth 
> be granted program status. 
> FLORIDA: You don't even ask anymore whether the Gators are going to be 
> good. Since Steve Spurrier arrived in 1990, you stick Florida in your 
> preseason top 10 and go mow the lawn. 
> TEXAS A&M: Last year, 12 people died while serving the program. 
> ARKANSAS: It didn't hurt that the school's longtime head coach, Frank 
> Broyles, made a seamless transition to longtime athletic director. 
> Bonus points for playing 1969 "Game of the Century" game against 
> Texas. 
> ARMY-NAVY: They enter together on a special program furlough. Both 
> academies have slipped a bit on the field, but the intensity of the 
> annual rivalry game is still Top Gun. 
> SYRACUSE: We almost 86'd the Orangeman because they play football on 
> fake grass in an aircraft hanger, but two names kept haunting us in 
> our sleep: Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Jim Brown, Ernie Davis. Syracuse 
> gets in on a historical pass. 
> WASHINGTON: It was more than Don James and a scandal that sealed the 
> Huskies' program status. The school was a turn-of-the-century 
> powerhouse, winning 39 consecutive from 1908-14. 
> BRIGHAM YOUNG: The Cougars qualify under the "Bowden Provision," 
> although BYU probably leans more toward "factory." Still, Coach LaVell 
> Edwards has made BYU impossible to ignore. Lord knows we have tried. 
> MISSISSIPPI: Faulkner-filled past and Southern charm triumphs over 
> recent mediocrity. You tend to forget John Vaught coached Ole Miss to 
> three national titles and that Peyton Manning's daddy once starred 
> there. 
> GEORGIA TECH: Two great "Bobby" coaches--Dodds and Ross--plus a coach, 
> John Heisman, who led school in 1916 to a 222-0 drubbing of Cumberland 
> College. It was Heisman, the man for whom the trophy is named, who 
> quipped, "Better to have died as a small boy than to fumble this 
> football." 
> MISSISSIPPI STATE: Can you let a school in on the strength of its 
> cowbells? 
> Yes, and Mooooooooo! 
> ARIZONA STATE: We thought of dumping ASU before considering the 
> prospect of Frank Kush hopping a plane to L.A. and making the sports 
> staff do bear crawls around Parker Center. Yes, the crew-cut Kush era 
> is long gone, but ASU bridged the program gap with John Cooper in the 
> 1980s and a national title run in 1996. What's more, ASU may be the 
> only program that ever created its own bowl game--the Fiesta. 
> WISCONSIN: The last school to get with our program, based on the 
> strength of Barry Alvarez's remarkable decade: 70-44-4 record, three 
> Big Ten titles and consecutive Rose Bowl wins. Wisconsin already had 
> in its favor a Grade AAA fight song--"On Wisconsin, On Wisconsin, 
> plunge right through that line!"--and the nickname power of Elroy 
> "Crazy Legs" Hirsch. 
> 
> Thinks It Is . . . but Isn't 
> UCLA: Just missed the cut (honest). Great uniforms, history, players 
> and a share of the 1954 national title, but word is Angelo Mazzone 
> hocked UCLA's program rights to Wisconsin for a tidy profit. 
> Moreover: a program doesn't rent its home stadium from its archrivals 
> for 50 years. 
> COLORADO: Earned upgrade stickers for the wild and wayward Bill 
> McCartney days, but this remains foremost a skiing school. 
> STANFORD: We argued Stanford's case to a national football tribunal. 
> Pop Warner, Jim Plunkett, John Elway, we said. 
> Judge's response: "The SAT scores are way, way too high to qualify for 
> program status." 
> ILLINOIS: Once you get beyond the eras, Red Grange and Dick Butkus, 
> the name that sticks is Jeff George. 
> BOSTON COLLEGE: Under Vatican rules, there are only enough vespers to 
> support one Catholic football superpower. 
> KENTUCKY: Yes, Bear Bryant went 60-23-5 in Lexington, but here's the 
> clincher: At a 1953 banquet, alums awarded Bryant a cigarette lighter. 
> Basketball coach Adolph Rupp received a Cadillac. 
> KANSAS STATE: Bill Snyder still has a few more atoms to split in 
> Manhattan. By our calculations, the Wildcats have to go undefeated for 
> the next 14 years to get back to .500. 
> NORTH CAROLINA: Mack Brown's Tar Heels went 11-1 in '97, finished No. 
> 4 in the coaches' poll, and he left to coach Texas. Why? 
> Because Texas is a program. 
> ARIZONA: Cannot even be considered by the program veteran's committee 
> until the school first appears in a Jan. 1 Rose Bowl. 
> OREGON: If this was a program, we wouldn't be concerned about Notre 
> Dame (program) air-lifting Coach Mike Bellotti out of Eugene. 
> CALIFORNIA: For goodness sakes, the guy ran the wrong way in the 1929 
> Rose Bowl and handed Georgia Tech (program) a national title! 
> PURDUE: Conclusive factoid: From 1887 to 1978, Boilermakers went to 
> one bowl: the '67 Rose. 
> WEST VIRGINIA: Had Bobby Bowden. Hung him in effigy. Bowden left to

> IOWA: So, Nile Kinnick won a Heisman Trophy and Hayden Fry had a few

> SOUTH CAROLINA: Two words: "Chicken Curse." 
> OKLAHOMA STATE: Jimmy Johnson, Barry Sanders and a lot of dust. 
> OTHER TEXAS SCHOOLS: Texas Tech, Baylor, Houston. Listen up: Playing

Uncle Clark,

How are things?  I hope this note finds you well.  I wanted to see if you 
were going to be in town for the weekend of November 11th.  I plan on 
bringing the whole group up for the KU-UT game that weekend.  I can't believe 
it has almost been 4 years since we last visited up there.  We are doing well 
here in Houston.  Everyone is getting ready for the school year.  In fact, 
Kristi has already started back.  The kids begin on the 9th.  Enron still 
seems to monopolize my time.  But it's a great place to work.  Let me know 
about that weekend.  I hope you will be in town as  I am looking forward to 
seeing you all.

DG

Jay,

I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but 
have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed 
to me.  I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th 
of each month if possible.  I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and 
then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 
transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already 
in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase 
the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).  Please help.  Thanks.

Subject: Changing Deals

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Thanks,

Jeff

I sent a MB Quart speaker back on 2/19 because it was making a buzzing 
sound.  It was recieved on 2/26.  Do you have any idea how long it will be 
before I get a replacement?  Thanks.

Prior to her trip to Texas, Buffy (a New Yorker) confided to her
sorority sisters she had three goals for her trip to the Lone Star
State.
She wanted to taste some real Texas Bar B Que, take in a bona fide
rodeo and
have sex with a cowboy.  Upon her return, her sorority sisters
were
curious as to how she fared.

Let me tell you, they have a tree down there called mesquite and
when  they slow cook that brisket over that mesquite, oh so
good!!!!
The taste is unbelievable!!!  I went to a real rodeo. Talk about
athletes,
these guys wrestle  real full-grown bulls- like in Spain.  Except
they
ride a horse out at full gallop, then jump off the horses and
literally
grab the bulls by the horns  and throw them to the ground.  It is
incredible!
They then asked, " Well tell us, did you have sex with a cowboy?"
Are you kidding?  Once I saw the outline of the condom they carry
around
in the back pocket of their jeans, I changed my mind!!!!

I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.  It was selfish and I 
sincerely appologize.  I don't know what I was thinking or why.  Well,  I 
just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.  Even though you may 
not believe it.  I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.  I 
love you very much, and will call you later.

Kevin,

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

DG

Audrey,

I'm in Chicago now but I need to ask you some questions about a few Sitara 
deals.  They are 298277, 298283, and 298296.  They are between EPMI and EMW.  
Are these deasl going to be settled by Unify?  Do we currently see Unify 
invoices/verifications for EMW or EPMI?  Thanks.

Good to get a message from you even tho I am pretty far away!!  I will check
calendar when I get home.  I am interviewing that week and some are
scheduled in hotel and some are on my end of town; didn't bring my schedule
for that with me.  We are in meetings from 9-5:30pm so now I see what it
must be like on your business trips!! Did spend an evening with my aunt and
cousins on Sunday and one of my first cousins is taking me around tonite for
a while.  Last nite I went on a twilight tour until 11:30.  The monuments
are so outstanding especially at night. Hope you can take your family
here...Chris would be in so much awe.  Glad you had a good time with Carlos.
I will talk to you this weekend.  Love, MOM

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather
was good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the
sights yet?

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when
we are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let
me know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and
return Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights
and getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the
neighbors.

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

Darron,

For audit purposes, can you give us a brief description of where the value 
for annuities in TAGG as V42434.9 and V42434.A.  We'll add some comments to 
TAGG to cover ourselves or send out Termination Agreements if necessary.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.

Subject: Story of the ant and the grasshopper

THE CLASSIC VERSION -
    The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
in the cold.

THE MODERN VERSION -
 The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The Grasshopper thinks he's a
fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.
    Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and
demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while
others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures
of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable
home with a table filled with food.
    "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?
Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."
    Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS
Evening News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything
they Can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves
by Those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill
refers
to it as "Temperatures of the 80's."
    Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where
the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome". Jesse then
has
the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.
    Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has
gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls for an immediate tax
hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share".
    Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Ant Act",
retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to
hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay
his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.
    Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a
Defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of
federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare
recipients who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM
when there are no talk shows scheduled. The ant loses the case.
    The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of
The ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to
be
the ant's old house, crumbles around him since he doesn't maintain it. The
ant has disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
bought
by selling most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton standing
before a wildly applauding group of Democrats announcing that a new era of
"fairness" has dawned in America.
    The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house,
now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once
peaceful neighborhood.

Remember to Vote .!!

We have made good progress in resolving ENA's OA variances for the October 
2000 and prior production periods in the past three months.  Our shared goal 
for the May GL accounting period is to resolve ALL OA variances for the 
December 2000 production month and prior.  We realize that this will entail a 
large effort on everyone's part, however, this will provide ENA with current 
OA variance data and eliminate the possibility of carrying variances for a 
prolonged period of time on the exposure schedule. 

If there are any questions, please let me know.  Thank you.

John

Subject: Canadian deals in US books.

Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that 
there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with 
counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should 
start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these 
deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron 
counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals 
have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when 
they can start invoicing as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter.

Thank you
Stacey

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

Hi guys,

Here's a spreadsheet with the list of Aquila Canada Corp. and Engage Energy 
Canada deals that need to be flipped right away.



The book is listed on the left column.  Please let me know when these are 
finished as I need to get an invoice to the customers within the next couple 
of hours.

Thanks
Stacey

Darron,

Per our earlier conversation, the following is a list of new deals that we 
have identified for further testing.  At your earliest convenience, could you 
please provide the applicable deal ticket and forwards details for these two 
deals?  Please let me know if you have any further questions or comments.

Please look over this and get back with me on any changes you would like to 
make.

I am going to set up a new counterparty in our system:  Enovate LLC.  Under 
this new counterparty will be 3 books in Tagg:  FT-ENOVATE, INTRA-ENOVATE, 
AND FT-INT-ENOVATE.  The INTRA-ENOVATE book will hold deals such as the 
Trunkline deal and will retain Rho & Drift.  The FT-ENOVATE book will be a 
flat book only used for  the confirmation process (deals must be in an FT 
book to be confirmed).  The FT-INT-ENOVATE book will pass Rho & Drift to the 
interest rate group.  This book will be used for EMW related deals not 
specific to Enovate.

The current entity Enron MW LLC will continue to be used and will have the 
following books in Tagg:  FT & Intra NSS1, FT & Intra NSS2, and FT & Intra 
TP.  FT and Intra MEH books will no longer be used.

The P&L will sum the 3 Enovate books to arrive at one number.  The other 
columns on the P&L(NSS1, NSS2, and TP) will be unaffected.

I had planned on just adding the Enovate books, but think we really need to 
set up a new entity as well.  I have run this by accounting and have their 
approval.  Let me know what you think and we will start the process.  We will 
have this completed by the end of this month.

Thanks.

Subject: New Book Codes

During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that 
had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them.  
We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to 
find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right 
people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our 
own.  

>From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone 
from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX 
invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of 
people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about?  
Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started 
putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.  

Thanks you so much for your help,
Becky

Enron announces UNLIMITED discounted AstroWorld tickets for employees.

Due to overwhelming employee feedback, we have negotiated unlimited 
discounted AstroWorld tickets for you and your family in place of the 
traditional "Enron Day At AstroWorld."  We hope this will allow Enron 
families to plan their fun-filled summer trips to AstroWorld at their own 
convenience.  Enron AstroWorld tickets are $20.56 (Retail $50), which 
includes admission for one, plus a $7 meal ticket to one of five restaurants 
at AstroWorld.

Six Flags AstroWorld is a world-class family entertainment complex filled 
with exciting rides and attractions, including 10 heart-pounding coasters, 
over  40 blockbuster shows, interactive street entertainers and star-studded 
concerts.  Enron families will be able to purchase unlimited tickets for use 
anytime during the 2001 season.

Tickets will be on sale at Enron's Federal Credit Union, EB0399.  Visit the 
credit union in person to make your purchases.  AstroWorld tickets will not 
be mailed.  Enron employees who are not already Enron FCU members may pay by 
cash or money order only.  All Enron Employees are encouraged to take 
advantage of this great summer fun deal and may purchase tickets through 
August 30th.

I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The 
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of 
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks 
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as 
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think 
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?  
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.

Mike,

How goes it?  I was thinking about you guys this weekend.  We were in town 
for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a 
friends place.  I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't 
seen you on this particular weekend.  We are still plugging along.  How about 
you?  I thought I heard you were buying a new house.  Is that right?  Well, I 
just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message 
from Sean.  We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.  I can't believe 
it has been 4 years since we were up there.  Take care.

DG

Hi Darron,

Please move these deals to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of tomorrow.



Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Also, please make sure 
that there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty in any of 
your books.  If there are, could you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS 
book.

Thanks
Stacey

My apologies to you left-wingers who may receive this e-mail...

While Al Gore  has a habit of exaggerating his record, these numbers tell
us the real truth  about his record on education, healthcare and taxes:


AL GORE'S  EDUCATION PLANS...

$10,000...? tax deduction that Al Gore says will  be received by "all
students who want to go to college".

$800... tax  deduction is the reality.

0... students working their way through college  getting a tax credit
because they do not pay enough in income  taxes.

30,000,000... low-income households get no benefit on Gore's  education
plan.

0...? families making over $20,000 get a  benefit.

5,000,000... upper income families are ineligible.

0...  deductions or credits for room, board, books, supplies, and travel.

1...  education plan that is almost identical to the one that failed in the
Clinton  White House.


AL GORE'S PROGRAM ON HEALTHCARE:

$600... access  fee per year to obtain prescription drug coverage under the
Gore  plan.

412... new regulatory mandates created by the Gore Medicare  plan.

182... new regulations dealing with prescription drugs  alone.

64.5... the age you are when you have your one and only  opportunity to buy
into a government HMO.

8... year wait for Gore's plan  to be implemented.

2... times the price of Bush's plan to create more  government bureaucrats


THE VICE PRESIDENT ON TAXES:

88...  separate tax increases along with 42 new user fees Gore proposed in
the 2001  budget.

11%... how much the tax burden has increased over the last 8  years.

$500... per child tax credit was never included in previous  Clinton/Gore
budgets.

50,000,000... taxpayers will not get tax relief  under Gore's plan.

$1,400... couples will pay in taxes because Gore  opposed the Marriage
Penalty tax cut.

4.3 cents...? tax increase on  a gallon of gas because of Gore's
tie-breaking vote.


THE MOST  IMPORTANT NUMBERS:

17... days until the election.

PLEASE PASS THIS  ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS!

Sincerely,

Jim  Nicholson
Chairman
Republican National Committee

P.S.??  The average Republican has 28 names in his or her email directory -
that means  if we all forward this message to our friends, this one email
can reach 14  million citizens!? Please forward to your friends and make

Subject: EnronOptions - Your Stock Option Program

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=

Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

Reference: LIFE
I am God.  Today I will be handling all of your problems.  Please
remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do

matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it.

Should you have a bad day at work; Think of the man who has been out of
work=

Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who

Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in
dire=
 straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her
children=
.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance;
Think of=
 the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer
patient=
 in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
ask=

Subject: Technical Questions

I also do not have many tech questions.  I look for trainability as well.  

My questions:
-What do you know about the commodities market?
-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of 
options,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like
    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to 
trade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they 
play        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  
-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do 
you hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  
-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar 
with the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?
-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central 
trader's new lackey)
-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using 
excel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared 
it with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give 
me a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current 
organization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer 
is the truth and what kind of ego they have) 
-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.
-Are you easily incited to violence?

Subject: Technical Questions

I do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have 
used:

- Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and 
yesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?
- What makes up a P&L statement?
- What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?
- If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?

I guess these are more general analytical questions:

- Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?
- The "eight ball" question (basic problem solving)
- The "light switch" question (advanced problem solving)

When I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem 
solving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate 
has these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I 
also think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit 
for us.  They know they don't know everything (about Risk) and work hard to 
get up to speed.

Subject: Synthetic Storage Liquidation Variances

Darron,

I am going to try to put my thoughts on paper, but call me if there are any 
further questions...

For April, we have 1,390,618 of expense on the back page.  I have narrowed it 
down to the following...
 Tagg #N06517 being double booked  $952,500  (the correct tagg # is N08646).  
 The other side of the storage transaction is in 9/00 physical liquidation 
file and it is for 1,866,000.
 Looks like double booking it actually made us money. Check it out though!
 
 137,000 in liquidations should have been moved to commodity expense to cover 
transportations
 OA, but it wasn't., so we this is income for us.

 Two deals were booked in sitara but not tagg and, therefore, no liquidation 
to cover the expenses.
 They are sitara #242510 and #128336.  The total of these equaled 429,477.  

For May, we have 1,889,707 in income on the back page.  This comes from:
 Another deal booked twice....Tagg #N05499 was booked as duplicate (the right 
one is #N08617)
 The other side (expense) of the deal was taken in Dec.99. Therefore, I see 
this as true income!
 
 Tagg #NJ4479, I will have to talk with you about this.  I don't fully 
understand it myself.

 93,924 (Tagg #NG0049), this should have been transferred to 3rd party 
sales/purchases.
 This storage deal is booked directly with the third party.

I have not looked at July in full, but have some print outs to give you.

Please let me know if you have any further questions on this crap!  I am just 
a phone call away.

Dawn

How goes it?  I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for 
March.  I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the 
four of us.  He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying 
with us.  I hope this is OK.  He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out 
one night.  Let me know.  Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad 
school.  He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.  Talk to you soon.

What is Love

A group of professional people posed this question to
a group of 4 to 8 year-olds, "What does love mean?"

The answers they got were broader and deeper than
anyone could have imagined. See what you think.

"When you tell someone something bad about yourself
and you're scared they won't love you anymore. But
then you get surprised because not only do they still
love you, they love you even more." Matthew - age 7

"Love is that first feeling you feel before all the
bad stuff gets in the way." - Charlie age 5

"God could have said magic words to make the nails
fall off the cross,but He didn't. That's love."? Max -
age 5

"When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend
over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather
does it for her all the time, even when his hands got
arthritis too. That's love." - Rebecca - age 8

"When someone loves you, the way they say your name is
different. You know that your name is safe in their
mouth." - Billy - age 4

"Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on
shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other."
- Karl - age 5

"Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most
of your French fries without making them give you any
of theirs." - Chrissy - age 6

"Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad
but you don't yell at them because you know it would
hurt their feelings." - Samantha - age 6

"Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." -
Terri - age 4

"Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and
she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure
the taste is OK." - Danny - age 7

"Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get
tired of kissing, you still want to be together and
you talk more. My mommy and Daddy are like that. They
look gross when they kiss." - Emily - age 8

"Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if
you stop opening presents and listen." - Bobby - age 5

"If you want to learn to love better, you should start
with a friend who you hate." - Nikka - age 6

"Love is hugging. Love is kissing. Love is saying no"
- Patty - age 8

"There are two kinds of love. Our love. God's love.
But God makes both kinds of them." - Jenny - age 4

"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then
he wears it everyday." - Noelle - age 7

"Love is like a little old woman and a little old man
who are still friends even after they know each other
so well." - Tommy - age 6

"During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared.
I looked at all the people watching me and saw my
daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing
that. I wasn't scared anymore." Cindy - age 8

"My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see
anyone else kissing me to sleep at night." - Clare -
Age 5

"Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of
chicken." Elaine -age 5

"Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and
still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford." -
Chris - age 8

"Love is when your puppy licks your face even after
you left him alone all day." - Mary Ann - age 4

"I know my older sister loves me because she gives me
all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new
ones." - Lauren - age - 4

"I let my big sister pick on me because my Mom says
she only picks on me because she loves me. So I pick
on my baby sister because I love her." Bethany - age 4

"Love cards like Valentine's cards say stuff on them
that we'd like to say ourselves, but we wouldn't be
caught dead saying." - Mike - age 8

"When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down
and little stars come out of you." - Karen - age 7

"Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she
doesn't think it's gross." - Mark - age 6

"You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean
it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot.
People forget." - Jessica - age 8

Hi guys,
Here is a list of deals that I know of that need to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book right away.  Please go through your books to see if 
there are any deals that I might have missed.

FT-CENT
QL0357.1

FT-East
QK7518.1
QL0420.1
QL0428.1

FT-Northwest
QK1495.1

G-DAILY-EST


GD-New
QL7501.1
QM8047.1


I didnt' come across any deals with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC in your 
books, so I think there may be some being booked still as ENA and DEMLP.  
These all need to be flipped to settle in the FT-US/CAND-ERMS books like the 
rest of these deals.  I've spoken to Jennifer Denny with EOL about getting a 
program set up for Duke deals similar to ones we have with TransCanada Energy 
and Dynegy Canada so they automatically get booked to settle with ECC, but I 
don't think this has happened yet.  Please go through your books to make sure 
that no Duke deals have been missed.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

Brad,
 We have a few analyst showing up on our O&M report.  Our O&M representative, 
Holly Heath, said that we are not being charged for these individuals.  It 
appears that we are  and I am trying to find out how did these individuals 
get on our cost center and what cost center they need to be charged to.  
Please review your resources and let me know what cost center you have the 
below individuals reporting to.

R. Mwongozi

Thank you,

Hello, Young People.....
?
Still planning on the KU/UT game next weekend, I  hope.? If you are flying 
in, you can get?from the airport, about 30-35  miles, without hitting a 
traffic light until the last mile or so.
?
FROM THE AIRPORT:
1.? Exit the airport toward Kansas City on  I-29 South.? When you get to
2.??I-635, go South; probably will be  marked to "Wichita" or maybe Kansas 
City.? When you get to
3.??I-35, go South again.? You will  be somewhere around 50th street.? Street 
numbers increase as you go  south.
4.? After 75th Street stay in the right lane  and take Hiway 69 South.
5.? Stay on Hiway 69; after 119th Street it  will curve left and then right.? 
After the right hand curve, the road  merges with another highway.? Stay in 
the extreme right lane  and
6.? Exit at 135th street.? Exit to the  right and stay in the right lane 
until the first light; (Antioch).? (About  half mile).
7.? Turn right at Antioch (first light) and  get into the left lane.
8.? Short block to the first light; this is  133rd Street; turn left.
9.? Go to the second right; this is  Kessler.? Turn right on Kessler.
10.? Take the immediate left onto 132nd  Place.? Go to second house on right; 
not counting the house on the  corner.? The address is 9210.
?
After you leave the airport, the exits onto I-29  and then onto I-35 come a 
little quickly, so watch for the signs.?  I expect to be home all weekend.? 
But, if I  am out, the garage door keypad combination is "0730".? Make 
yourselves at  home and help yourselves to anything that is not tied or 
nailed down or  hazardous.? My phone number is (913) 402-9210; cell phone is 
(913)  269-6247.? Not necessary to dial the area code once you get into  
Kansas.? From the airport (Missouri) you'll need the area  code.
?
If you're driving, exit I-35 in Olathe at Exit  215.? Turn right and go about 
4.5 miles to Switzer (school on left; park on  right).? Left on Switzer to 
first right (133rd Street).? Right on  133rd to second left (Kessler).? Left 
on Kessler; left on 132nd Place to  house.? Let me know when you expect to 
arrive and then depart and maybe we  can line something up to keep you busy 
while you're here.? Sean and Tracie  will be in San Antonio that weekend, and 
Mike and Christine can't make it, but  Michelle and her gang and Kim are 
anxious to see you again.? See you  soon......Clark.

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

It's no big deal, but I still can't see Kristi's IRA online.  I also don't 
receive statements in the mail for the account.  It looks as if the automated 
transactions worked this month.

used for 02/01). The customer invoiced ENA a price of $2.3043. Can you please 
update the deal in Sitara to reflect the correct price for 03/01?

Thanks,

I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.  I held back 
$1,087,409 from the MEH book.  The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was 
$20K added to the P&L last Friday.  I did not add that amount back in 
tonight.  I don't know what it is.  I'll talk to you in the morning.  Let me 
know if there is something you want me to send you.  Thanks.

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Subject: New EAST books

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly 
to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to 
sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.  

Thanks for your help on this.

I am in the process of getting these deals valued.  I know what we have 
booked in Tagg as of now, but need to reconcile it to what People's has 
booked.  I got something from Steve last time I was up, but it does not have 
deal terms.  Could you ask Steve for a list that has the terms of each deal?  
I don't even know his last name.  Thanks.

Friday, November 10, 2000
IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

I wanted to see if the address worked.  We had a good time in NO.  We 
definitely want to go back.  It was really crowded, but fun.  The weather was 
good and the food was great.  How is DC?  Have you seen any of the sights 
yet?  

I wanted to ask if you can help with C&C on the 16th and 17th of May when we 
are in Chicago.  I know your schedule just got alot more hectic, so let me 
know.  They can stay in Conroe on Fri and Sat.  We leave Wed night and return 
Sun morning.  It would mean be staying at our house on those nights and 
getting them to school.  If you can't, we will try to get one of the 
neighbors.  

Thanks.  See you when you get back.

Kam,

Jim called me about this and I asked him to email me.  But all these storage 
facilities are on the East desk.

Per our conversation, please advise as to what GD index Enron would use to 
value physical storage on the following East pipes:

Cove Point - I think it is in Maryland.  Acquired from CES
National Fuel -
Tennessee - which of the many indices
Napoleonville - 
Transco - which of the many indices


Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  I need this for 
our auditors.

Thanks.

Kevin,

Doing some more month end clean up.  

I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is:

For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000 
through July 31,200 for 1Bcf.

1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000

I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into 
this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski.

If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice.

Thanks,
Kevin

Mike,

The reason my mistake was not caught on the benchmark signoff procedure is 
that the postid in question did not have a net position.  The procedure 
Rahmann showed you is where we check GERMS positions to the position reports 
we run using Excel queries.  If a postid has a net position and is not 
officialized, it will be caught using this procedure.  It will not, however, 
if the postid does not have a position.  I understand the importance of 
officializing postid's, as does the entire West desk.  Thanks.

Jeff,

FYI - Darron Giron didn't officialize the West-NW-GDL book on Friday.  Please 
re-emphasize the importance of not forgetting.  Also, Rahmann showed me a 
control he has to catch books not officialized each night which looked like 
an effective tool.  I wonder why he didn't see this book on Friday.

Mike

We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  

Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).

Thanks,
Mike

Texas Baby 

A Texan buys a round of drinks for all in  the bar?because, he announces
his wife has just produced "a typical  Texas baby boy weighing 25 pounds."
Congratulations shower him from all  around, and many?exclamations of
"Wow!" are heard. A woman faints due  to?sympathy pains 

Two weeks later, he returns to the bar. The  bartender?says, "Say,
you're the father of the typical Texas  baby?that weighed 25 pounds at
birth. How much does he weigh now?"  

The proud father answers, "Seventeen pounds." 

The bartender is  puzzled, concerned. "Why? What?happened? He already
weighed 25 pounds at  birth." 

The Texas father takes a slow swig from his long-neck?Lone  Star, wipes
his lips on his shirtsleeve, leans into?the bartender and  proudly
says,? "Had him circumcised."

Jay,

I can't see the new IRAs on the web site.  It's no big deal.  But I would 
like to have them linked.  Thanks.  Did you go to the playoff games?  It's

Gary,

I need some Tagg books set up for the Chicago office.  I submitted a request 
this morning to create a new counterparty:  Enovate, LLC which will be an 
Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these 
books by the end of next week.  Please let me know if there is anything I 
need to do to help.  Thanks as always.

I will be interviewing applicants and cannot pick up C and C for the next  
three weeks. There may be some Tuesdays between now and the end of school  
that I will still be able to watch them....it will be a week by week thing. ? 
If you want to get someone on a permanent basis or if you want to know about  
me week by week....let me know. Do whatever is easier on you and the kids. ? 
Hope the weekend was fun. ?MOM

Subject: New Bridge Monitor

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

Steve,
Congratulations.  Welcome back.  I sent you a note and a spreadsheet with the 
deals we have booked in our system.  I was trying to reconcile them to your 
list of deals.  I could not.  But I think the best thing to do is to simply 
start over and book the deals you tell me to.  I just need the exact terms.  
I know it's your first day back and you are probably swamped, but when you 
get a chance, please give me a call.  Richard wants me to have these deals 
valued by the end of this month's P&L.  Thanks.

DG

I spoke with Bill K. about the TDS positions problems we had this morning.  
They had to take TDS down this weekend and when it was brought back up all 
the positions were reloaded.  

He thinks the new TDS portcalc will be ready to go later this week which will 
prevent this from happening again.

Sean,

How's CO?  I hope you are doing well.  I know I have asked you before, but I 
seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.  I 
want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in 
November.  I want to bring the whole family.  If you get a chance, shoot me a 
message with his info.  My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her.  
Thanks.

We have some new procedures for changing deals that affect other books.  
Please read and let me know if you have any further questions.  You don't 
need to request minibook access individually.  I have, so if needed we can 
run them on my machine.  Thanks.

Subject: Changing Deals

Effective immediately,  if anyone changes any deal for any reason,  they need 
to provide a minibook with a before and after of exactly what they did.  This 
used to be a common courtesy,  but it looks like we need a stated policy in 
place.  You guys will therefore have to get minibook access to calc all books 
on a mini-book level from Jeremy.  Please let me know the timing Jeremy gives 
for getting the appropriate people mini-book access as soon as possible.  It 
is critical that we get this done right away.  I know that this is not a 
one-sided issue.  No group is better or more important than any other group.  
It is therefore important that we do a better job of communicating across 
groups.

Thanks,

Jeff

This is a modification of the old file.  If you had the same book and 
portfolio code for more than one book (ex. GG) it will pull in all GG 
post-id's.  
This one requires a comment in all post-id's to pull in only those.

can benefit.

Let me know if you have questions.

Hey guys - I am going to have a July 4th celebration at my house (but not on 
the 4th - it will be on the 3rd - Monday).  Kids are welcome, although I 
can't promise things will remain under control all day!!!!  

I am going to get a keg of beer for us, but feel free to bring your beverage 
of choice.  I thought we would grill burgers and hot dogs - so just bring 
your own meat, and I will take care of all the sides.  Feel free to bring 
whatever you want for munchies....plan on an all day/night affair!



Call me if you need directions!  Let me know if you can make it so I can make 
sure I have enough food and drinks!

By the way, I do not have any furniture downstairs, so bring lawnchairs!

Mark,

I think I need some help reconciling what Steve Richman has and we have 
booked for the HUB deals.  He sent me a spreadsheet with deals but I cannot 
even come close to tying them out to what we have booked in Tagg.  Richard 
suggested I contact you since Steve is out.  Attached is a list of deals we 
currently have booked in Tagg for the HUB deals.  They need to be verified 
before I can calc them for value and positions.  I will be out tomorrow, 
returning on Monday.  Thanks for your help.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Effective May 6, 2001, New Hire Orientation will go from a day program to 
half a day. The New Hire Orientation will start at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 
pm. The new hires will no longer be given lunch. This change was initiated as 
a result of cost cutting measures. 

We will be distributing the Inside Track at Sally Beck's next staff meeting 
scheduled for 5/14/01. This is an additional tool you can use to integrate 
the employee to your business unit. The Inside Track is a supplement to the 
handouts the new hires receive at orientation. It contains: general 
information, Windows 2000, Microsoft Outlook, PRC process and the business 
unit training expectations. We suggest personally greeting and delivering the 
Inside Track and taking your new hire out to lunch. If this is not possible 
we recommend sending a representative. We feel this would be a great way to 
welcome your new hire to Enron and your business unit. Please contact your 
Human Resources representative if you have any question. 

Regards
Frank

Message-ID: <3AA90C94.74BC2CE2@flash.net>  

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...

Subject: RE:  Your NIKE iD order o16468000 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD

Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti 

From: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
To: "'Jonah H.  Peretti'" <peretti@media.mit.edu> 
Subject: RE:  Your NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>  
To: "Personalize, NIKE iD"  <nikeid_personalize@nike.com> 
Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

There is a correction for Texaco trades.

All Financial trades will be under Texaco Inc.

All physical trades will be under Texaco Natural Gas Inc.

Tell Dan that a glacier moves forward, not backward.  On a balk, the batter 
does not advance, only the baserunners.  But he may have a point with cricket.

It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for April, 2001.  
Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM 
Hours Survey\ProdUser to access the hours survey.

For those of you who have converted to Windows 2000, please DO NOT convert 
the database when you open it as everyone has not converted to Windows 2000 
yet.  If you do not convert, you can still enter your hours into the 
survey.   

Since we are beginning a new quarter, we have cleared all FTE's in the hours 
survey so please make sure to complete the FTE's section of the survey this 
month.  You can enter your FTE's using the second button on the main menu of 
the survey.  When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are 
any Director (this includes Sr. Directors), Sr. Admin or Admin positions in 
your cost center, please complete accordingly.  You are not expected to 
complete a hours survey for these positions but we do need them to be 
included in your FTE's.

Please have your survey completed by Monday, May 7.  Please call me if you 
have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Roxanne
(X 5-8690)

Tara and I will be here early in the morning to monitor the bridge and make 
sure the physical deals are bridging correctly.  Please make sure you keep an 
eye on these deals and let us know if something looks "funny".  If, by 
chance, a transaction fails for some reason, please do not bridge manually, 
we will try to fix the problem on our end.  

Thank you for all of your help this transition.

Here is a list of all currently flowing deals with counterparties that Credit 
has deemed not worthy of entering into physical trades with.  The file is 
currently sorted to show the most recent trades up front and is filtered to 
only show 'No Trades' - physical.  If you care to see other counterparty 
designations, re-filter on the physical terms column.

We can now calc at home/on the laptops.  After you dial in,( connect to 
remoteservices.enron.com and log in), select start/programs/trading/xterm off 
of the menu.  Xterm will bring up a window ... type in runm.  After that it 
is calcing as normal.  From what I can tell it works okay.  Let me know if 
you have any problems.

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,
Dawn

Troy,

I'm out of the office this morning.  I'll get back to you later about the 
variance.  But just so you know, Kevin's reported P&L was understated by the 
$188K on the OA Flash tab.  He made an error in the sharing calculation.

A W4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately.  If you 
don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you 
may owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and 
married and jointly.  I hope that made sense.

Regina,

I need two Sitara books set up in a new region.  The region can be called 
Enovate with the books IM Enovate and FT Enovate.  They are part of the other 
Chicago books:  Midwest, Midwest Program 1, and Midwest Program 2.  I have 
attached the book request I sent Susan Trevino.  Let me know if there is 
anything else I need to do.  I want to make sure that the books are not only 
in Sitara, but also in CPR for valuation purposes.  Thanks so much for your 
help.

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks

Kevin,

Please remember to link up all deals.  By this, I mean Tagg numbers in 
Sitara, Sitara numbers in Tagg, Tagg numbers in SCI, and especially EOL 
numbers in Tagg.  I just got a call about the park & loan on Friday.  You

: Thermics of Hell

The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington
chemistry mid term.  The answer by one student was so profound that the
professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course,
why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.

Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs
heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas
cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some
variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need
to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are
leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it
will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are
entering Hell, lets look at the different
religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that
if you are not a member of their religion,
you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and
since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that
all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in
Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the
volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature
and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand
proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:
1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter
Hell, then the temperature and pressure   in Hell will increase until all
Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell,
then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So
which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year,
....that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you, and take
into
account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations
with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is
exothermic and will not freeze.

The student received the only A given

A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country
club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The
man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf
pro says not bad. Golfpro: "Now hold the club as firm as you hold your
wife's breasts". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards.
The golf pro says "Excellent!" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes
30 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your
husbands penis." She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad,
but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."

Darin - Great talking with you.

Mail the check to 11621 Rydalwater Lane, Austin, TX 78754-5720.

You wanted two season tix at $195 each and 4 OU tix at $55 each for a total
of $610.  I take it you didn't want any other individual game tickets.  (I
forgot to ask).

We'll find out about the OU tix in late August/early September.  If we
don't get them, we'll get a refund.

Kristi said you called on Saturday.  I was golfing.  What did you think about 
the draft?  I thought LD was a good college player, but not great.  Everyone 
seems to think he will be an All-Pro type player before he's done.  As long 
as he works hard, I think SR would make the best Pro.  But what do I know?

Will be sending you info about a first cousin's reunion set for next sept
near Denver.  Barry's family had already planned a family vacation there and
I think Sean and Kim convinced them that this would be a good time for all 9
of you to try to get together.
Barry already has reservations at two condos there so will xerox Erva's
letter.  I am willing to foot the bill for the condos.

Here is the spreadsheet we discussed in today's meeting.  It should be pretty 
straightforward.  If you have any questions, please ask.  I'll be happy to 
help you out.

I will look at a way to "tie-in" Winzip with this spreadsheet.  I don't know 
if it is possible, but if I can accomplish it, I'll let you know.

Subject: Excel file to help you out

Here is a spreadsheet I worked up to help you determine what files need to be 
cleaned up.  It is pretty simple and straightforward.  You can enter a 
directory, file extention (if you want all file types, just enter a "*"), a 
minimum file size, and a modified before date.  The spreadsheet will perform 
a search of the directory and all subdirectories and return the files 
matching the criteria you specified.

The information is returned sorted by directory, but you can then sort by 
size, date, or whatever.

This should help you make a quick pass through your files on the "O" drive to 
determine some of the older/bigger ones you can clean up.

I would encourage you not to just enter "O:\" in the directory because the 
program will take forever, and you will run out of rows in excel to store the 
data.  Since it is in Excel, it will take just a while if you run it on a 
directory with a lot of files, so be a little patient.

I don't want to spend a lot of time supporting this thing, so if you 
distribute further, just don't tell them where you got it from (unless you 
want to designate a given person on your desk to perform the work).  

Let me know if you have questions or problems.

Greg

Gary,
We need to have two more books created as soon as possible.  These need to be 
set up the same as the others(not as PA books) Kam requested (moving from and 
Intra book to an FT book).

 FT-INT-CNT-TRANS
 FT-INT-EMWMEH

Call if you have any questions.  Thanks

Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.

Well, I win the award for ass of the week and probably the year.  I really 
can't begin to apologize enough for Tuesday.  I won't offer an excuse.  Guys 
on the Central desk asked me a question as soon as I hung up with you, and 
before I knew it, it was around 2:30pm.  But the worst part is, I didn't 
realize what I had done until later the next day.  It was disrespectful and I 
sincerely apologize.  I do have a conflict tomorrow.  And I will understand 
if you want to stop the sessions.  Thanks.

In addition:  expert clauses - which ones need to be changed, when and why - 
what are reversals and why we use them - how to check physical prompt month 
value for potential errors - how to calculate physical prompt month value - 
checking the OA Flash tab.  I am sure there are some others.

Topics should include:  NX3 roll-off, the curveshift associate with basis NX3 
roll-off and where it will show up on the p&l, what days we will roll in 
index - the percentages, how to adjust percentages for fixed priced prompt 
month positions, when to bring in prompt month value, how to put liquidations 
in the physical P&L, how to roll the physical and financial p&l's, etc.

Any suggestions?

Our next class will combine EOM bench/NGP&L and P&L procedures.  We will hold 
the class Tuesday @ 9:30 and combine both groups 1&2 for one class.  Jeff 
would like to go over the bench and NGP&L process for 45 minutes or so, and 
the rest of the class will be handled by Dave and Kam.  I will leave it to 
you 2 to decide who will talk about what.  Lets get together on Monday to 
brainstorm.

Subject: requests for new curves, new books, porfolio changes

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Hi All -

The following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) project status:

TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam, 
Phillip, Darron and Winfree have received training and Errol is scheduled for 
tomorrow (5/15).

One request that came out of training was to provide a "left column freeze" 
in order to scroll across and still maintain what row is being reviewed.  Hal 
will follow up on this request.  Please forward me any additional requests 
that may be required or suggestions you may have. 

Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history 
is being established and provide realistic information to review during UAT.  
Also, we ask that each one of you review the system as much as possible 
during the UAT review period this week to ensure the system is working 
properly and is meeting your expectations. 

Thank you for your help and support!

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop 
sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.  I actually have already 
done this on the web.  What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase 
of APGCX for $340 begining this month.  Also, any idea if I am going to 
receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?  I noticed online 
that  the Roths are now zero.  Thanks.

Subject: Orig.

Darron, you recognized 3.975 (thousand) of orig, and I did not see that 
coming out of any book. Could you let me know who granted that. 

I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine 
anything else. Also, if you could please look into the 468 (dollars) that I 
mentioned on my previous email, I would appreciate it. 

Thanks. 

If you have any questions let me know. 

Gabriel

Subject: Aquila Canada Corp. deals in Houston books

Hi guys,

I've just come across a few deals that are in TAGG as settling between
ENA and Aquila Canada Corp.  These deals would not have shown up when
you looked for deals to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as they aren't in
TAGG as ECC deals.  I have a feeling that there are lots of deals like this in
TAGG, but I just don't know where. We are having problems printing TAGG 
tickets 
up here, so I'm not able to see which books these deals are in right now.  
What I'm 
requesting is that you go through all your books and look for all deals with 
Aquila
Canada Corp. that are to settle for March and April 2001, and after, and flip 
these
deals into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  As it stands, 
I'm missing at least 10 deals from the April 2001 Nymex invoice, and I want to
make sure that these deals don't get invoiced by someone in Houston 
settlements.
Nymex settled yesterday for April, so invoicing for these deals is taking 
place
today.  

I understand that you are all very busy right now, but it would really be 
appreciated
if this was dealt with as soon as possible today.  The settlements group and 
I need
to get our invoices sent out today, so we need these deals to be fixed right 
away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this matter, and let me know 
if I 
can assist you in any way.

Thanks so much for your help
Stacey-

We have reviewed the exception reports and no one entered the headcount for 
their cost center in the survey.  Please go into the second button named 
"Please Enter Number of People for Each Position" and enter your headcount by 
position.  This information gets rolled over each month except when we begin 
a new quarter and we require that you enter your FTEs into a blank database.

Thanks,

Subject: FW: OPM Hours Survey - USE ACCESS 97 PLEASE!!


It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for April, 2001.  
Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM 
Hours Survey\ProdUser to access the hours survey.

For those of you who have converted to Windows 2000, please DO NOT convert 
the database when you open it as everyone has not converted to Windows 2000 
yet.  If you do not convert, you can still enter your hours into the 
survey.   

Since we are beginning a new quarter, we have cleared all FTE's in the hours 
survey so please make sure to complete the FTE's section of the survey this 
month.  You can enter your FTE's using the second button on the main menu of 
the survey.  When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are 
any Director (this includes Sr. Directors), Sr. Admin or Admin positions in 
your cost center, please complete accordingly.  You are not expected to 
complete a hours survey for these positions but we do need them to be 
included in your FTE's.

Please have your survey completed by Monday, May 7.  Please call me if you 
have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Roxanne

Let's make sure we are doing this every night.  I think Jason has been 
running the official post id macro most nights, but we need to have the last 
person finished do it every day.  I sure can crank out the emails when I get 
some uninterrupted time to myself!

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.

Hi,

I am expanding my Risk Management search outside of  the Houston area. Just 
wanted to know if we found the perfect candidate would you be willing to pay 
relocation and interviewing expenses?  Your feedback is appreciated.

Subject: Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play


Friday, November 10, 2000
IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

Darron,

For Oct 2000 I found a Liquidation amount in the Central region for The 
Peoples Gas Light & Coke......$336,234.06
Yet, I show no transactions for them in that region.  I looked in tagg - deal 
capture and for the tagg numbers listed
in the detail OA-liquidation spreadsheet (N17872.1   N17872.2   N18064.1   
N18064.2), I either saw no "comments",
or there was a comment referring to a "North Shore Baseload sale".

Would you please assist me or direct me to the person who would be familiar 
with this.
I am placing copies of the documents referred to above, on your desk.

Thanks for you help.

Doug

I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.  The 
reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question 
is 06/00.  When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price.  
And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct.  
Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.

A W4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay 
period.  There are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing 
status.  The higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld.  Married 
and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.  There 
is really no good or bad answer, only opinion.  If you want more withheld 
each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on 
April 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly.  If you don't 
want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may 
owe $ later on (April 15th), then claim fewer dependents and married and 
seperately.  I hope that made sense.

Hey Scott T -  I was just up on 19 funny knowing you're right above me.
   They just sent me down a new W4 to fill out - do you know if its better
to
   file married and jointly or married and separately? How do I find out.
You
   know Mr. Scharck doesnt have a clue and Im not really sure either.
   Thanks for the idea about the DVD player - thats what he is getting and
Mike
   told me to get The Patriot, Matrix and Fight Club - Big George is
driving up
   with Drew, Chris Melber, Ross etc on Friday and he is going to take it
for me
   - so you don't have to mess with it.

   Ciao, Lester

This is the last deal that is in the FT-Norhtwest book that needs to be
flipped into the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book, to settle between ECC and
Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership.  This needs to be fixed so
liquidations will be correct for Novmeber.

There seems to be some confusion about this deal, so please call me
or Greg Carraway about this deal, and maybe we can answer questions
if there are any.

Thanks
Stacey

Andrea,

Is it possible to get a list of first year analysts who graduated in December 
to interview for my group?  I don't know how the process works, but I would 
like to hire a candidate just out of college if possible.  Thanks for your 
help.

********************************************************

Dear UT Alumni and Friends,

There are two funding issues before the Texas Legislature that are of
critical importance to The University of Texas
at Austin and all of higher education.  These issues are:

Increasing university tuition rates by $2 a semester credit hour each year
through the 2005-2006 academic year; and
Retaining 100% of indirect cost funding earned on research awards and
contracts.

WE NEED YOU TO CONTACT LEGISLATORS TO VOICE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE
MEASURES.  Unless these two issues are passed
by the Legislature, UT Austin risks being less competitive with its peer
institutions for faculty and research dollars,
and will lose the momentum that resulted from the investment made in higher
education for the last two legislative sessions.

INCREASING TUITION: Senate Bill 1466 by Senator Teel Bivins and House Bill
2531 by Representative Rob Junell would authorize
a $2 a semester credit hour increase in tuition rates each year through the
2005-2006 academic year.  The House bill also
increases tuition by $1 a semester credit hour for each of the following
five years.  We do not know which bill will
move first.  However, one of these bills should be before the full Senate
or House soon.  Please call your State Senator
and Representative and other members you know and say, "I support SB 1466
and HB 2531, the bills to increase tuition
rates at universities, and urge you to vote for this legislation when it
reaches the Senate/House floor." (Phone numbers available
at http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/senmem.htm and
http://www.house.state.tx.us/house/member.htm)
(or copy this address into the location/address field of your
browser)  Reasons to support the bill include:

Texas ranks 32nd among the states in total tuition and fees paid to
comprehensive colleges and universities.

Tuition is a necessary part of the financing for university operations
since general revenue provides only a portion of state
appropriated funds.  The first year revenue gain from the tuition increase
for all universities would be about $22 million.
Of that amount, over $6 million would flow to UT System universities.

Fifteen percent of the tuition increase is devoted automatically to student
financial aid.

RETENTION OF 100% OF INDIRECT COST FUNDING: Senate Bill 1, the State budget
bill, uses 50% of the indirect cost funds earned
by a university on research awards and contracts to offset university
appropriations.  The Conference Committee on SB 1 may consider
allowing universities to retain up to 100% of these funds.  Please call
members of the Conference Committee on SB 1 and say,
"I support allowing universities to retain 100% of indirect cost funds
earned on research grants and contracts, and urge you to
make that change in the Appropriations Bill, SB 1."  The 10 Senators and
Representatives on the Conference Committee are:
Senators Rodney Ellis (512-463-0113), Robert Duncan (512-463-0128), Chris
Harris (512-463-0110), Steve Ogden (512-463-0105) and Judith
Zaffirini (512-463-0121), and Representatives Rob Junell (512-463-0472),
Garnet Coleman (512-463-0524), Pete Gallego (512-463-0566),
Talmadge Heflin (512-463-0568), and Buddy West (512-463-0546).
Reasons to support this change are:

All of the ten most populous states allow their institutions to retain 100%
of their indirect costs, except for Florida, whose
institutions retain 98%, and Texas, whose universities get only 50%.

UT Austin would gain an estimated $16.3 million per year in additional
revenue with this change.  This revenue could be
used to expand UT's research capabilities by supporting faculty, providing
seed money for new projects and purchasing
research-related equipment.

Three recent reports recommend that Texas universities be allowed to retain
100% of indirect cost funding.  These
include reports from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, a
special commission appointed by then-Lieutenant
Governor Rick Perry, and Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Rylander.

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO SUPPORT YOUR UNIVERSITY BY CONTACTING LEGISLATORS
ON THESE TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES.

Hey,
What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted to 
ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that was 
recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village.

Edie, Darren, further to our conversation.  The only reporting that I would 
like to send upstairs is broken down into two categories.  West Gas Trading, 
and West Gas Origination.  All orig ( even Denver ) is coded to 107321. 
Inside of west gas orig we have created a tracking mechanism through Darren, 
that provides a seperate report broken down by individual or group but I am 
the only person who needs this data for right now.

Edie, please ensure that on a go forward basis that the actualized income 
streams have been coded in the proper places and that we do not double count 
again.  

Call if any questions.

Once you find this, please do not create or kill the hedge until the sitara

David, Will and myself have come up with a great team-building idea. We will 
pit all the risk groups against each other in a game of paintball as there 
are a number of people who would enjoy shooting each other with paint guns. I 
have narrowed it down to two possible weekends and need your help in 
identifying which would be the best for your respective groups.  

Option one: October 21 or 22
Option two:  November 18-19

Please report back to me as soon as possible so that I may reserve the 
facility. Thanks

Subject: Re: It could happen!!!  

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Its all about expectations, my man!  What was Texas Ranked at the beginning 
of the season????  I am waiting for CNNSI to come out with a poll on the most 
overrated team of the year---my guess---a pick'em b/w Alabama and Texas.  Any 
time Texas is challenged they "you-know-what" their pants.

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

Subject: It could happen!!!

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

GEAUX TIGERS!

Darron,

I need support for:

Denver 2,441,357

Please let me know when this may be available.  You may save the support to 
ERMS/1Intra/FRED Liquidations/"year"/"month"

I realize some of the may be transport and the detail should be minimal due 
to MGMT books; however, there are usually some Gas Daily deals that remain on 
the desk.

I WILL ALSO NEED SUPPORT FOR THE  DECEMBER AND JANUARY VALUES FOR ALL OF YOUR 
REGIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SAVE THEM OUT TO THE ABOVE DIRECTORY.

Thanks,

Jim
