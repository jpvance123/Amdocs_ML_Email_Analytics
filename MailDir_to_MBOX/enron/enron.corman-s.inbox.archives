Randy just called and wanted to let everyone know that he appreciates the coverage from the team.  He is back at home, but has not passed the 2 stones.  He is going to the urologist today.  I told him that everything has been covered for the weekend, so rest up and get better.

Team, 
1)  Harry has agreed to work the evening shift from Thursday through the weekend. He will be in at 9:30 on Wed.
2)  I let Janet know that she will be needed for the Wed. Evening shift. 
3)  Robert will come in at 9:30 Thursday to cover the late shift for Thursday only.  
4)  Someone will need to cover the late shift on Friday, since Robert has the day off.

Randy does have a kidney stone and the doctor told him to be off his feet for 48 hours.  As far as I know, he was going to be sent home from the hospital tonight.

I do believe this covers all of the shifts accept for Friday.  If there are any questions, please ask.

Thanks,
Scott

Team,

Randy became quite ill this afternoon with what is suspected to be a kidney stone.  The paramedics took him to St. Joseph's Hospital.  Thanks to Randy's creation of the team emergency phone list, we were able to contact his wife who is now at St. Joseph's with him as well as Robert Benningfield who followed the ambulance to the hospital.

Since Randy was scheduled to work evenings this week and weekend, we need to rearrange people. Scott has agreed to stay tonight.  I have called Harry since he is the backup for the weekend but he is out of pocket now.  If we hear from Harry and he can work nights, I will take a comp day tomorrow.  If we do not hear from Harry, or he cannot work the evening, I will come in and work the night shift for Wednesday.  Someone will need to pick up the Timely Process for me.  I'm not sure how I got in that slot, since I checked Cara's draft, but there you are.  

If Harry is unable to work nights, we will need volunteer(s) for Thursday through Sunday.  We will also need for Robert to continue his 10 to 7 or 9:30 to 6:30 shift for Thursday and Friday or get another volunteer for that time slot.

I will be at home tomorrow morning.  You can reach me at 713-665-7206.   

Thanks for your help in solving this dilemma.

Janet

I'm fine with the 1-2% growth rate, but think we need to make an assumption about the major contracts that expire 10/31/03.

		Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

Shelley and Steve,

As you know, we have been working with facilities to develop options to replace or improve our 75KVA UPS that provides power to the Gas Control environment. My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term. 

I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,
Kevin

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case

Attached is the Gulf South OBA with the following changes (in blue):

	1.  Daily tolerance changed from 50,000 to 100,000 Dth.
	2.  Suspension language stricken.
	3.  Language added to allow daily balancing at other points.
	4.  "No change to system" language made mutual.

Since we want to allow the use of other points to balance on a daily basis, do we want one OBA for all "Locations"?  If not, is the interconnect with the Gulf South Mobile Bay Faciliites the lonly "Location" to be covered by this agreement?  Finally, do we want to allow end of the month balancing at other points too?

Mike, were you ok with the 5% daily tolerance and the 50,000 Dth monthly tolerance?

I discussed wtih Mike before I drafted it.   Trunkline is completely different.   THey are smaller interconnects in constrained areas.    They have a tendency to underdeliver at one of the points.  We don't want to give them alot of slack, but netting together cuts our exposure.   Sheila is Director of Gas Logistics ---- that's who always looked at them before, if at all.

Sharon

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

Sharon,

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.

Shelley, first of all, I apologize for not responding in a timely manner.  I should have responded that we were waiting to gather additional comments, if any, and make one global response.  mea culpa.
Second, I received an email from Mike Mcgowan just a few moments ago wherein he is proposing a response to your request.  By copy of this memo, you can anticipate that Mike will forward a response shortly.
Again, sorry for the inconvenience.

Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted. 

We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Gary Kenagy and Scott Abshire

Larry is moving over to a Gas Controller position in Steve January's group.  Below, Steve mentions Larry's solid field experience. However, I would like to commend him on his ability to pick up the details associated with our monthly flash process, customer accounts meeting, and the various uploads necessary to help our monthly billing process run so smoothly.  Please stop by and wish Larry luck in his new job.

I am in the process of writing a job replacement justification requisition for Stan's approval and hope to replace his position within a few weeks.

Unfortunately, "Quotis from Bodnar" does not quite have the same ring as "Quotis from Otis"...

Hi Shelley,

Is there any way we can get a heads up as to when our "photo op" with Claire Shipman will air?  It looks like it will be a nice piece and I would like to catch it.

Thanks,

Bill

What I would like to do is give Rita a temp badge every day.  Do you see a problem with this?

The most ability is responsibility.  Nothing happens until someone steps forward and says, "You can count on me."

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Thanks for your help,

Raetta

I'm confused - I thought we had throughput data on a more timely manner? Is it the specific format that is the problem or the data itself? If we want to estimate it, that would be fine also.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide.  I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001.  Please let me know if you have this information.

Thank you,

2. Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow

3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).  Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

Yes, I am feeling a whole lot better.  I still have one kidney stone in my right kidney that will be something special to look forward to.  This time with the knowledge I acquired from this first experience, my Urologist and I have a PLAN of ACTION prepared.  This should make the second episode less painful.  Or least it sounds good.

I really appreciate your assistance in reviewing the NNG contract files, pulling out and making copies of all letter agreements for our most recent data request from Dynegy.  I understand the coordination this required and the tight time constraint that you worked under (during bid week and the preliminary reservation billing cycle) and am pleased with your sense of urgency.     

Thank you for the effort and, as a result, now have complete binders of all letter agreements that are in Houston.  When I am in Omaha on Wednesday, I will ask Dari if she has any letter agreements in her office that may not have been forwarded on to Houston.  If she does, I will make sure we receive copies of these agreements.  
  
Rick

If anyone has time today we still have several NNG contract files that need reviewed for letter agreements, and need copies made. This needs to be done before the end of today (Monday.)

Please come into the file room to help if you have time. Thanks

 One day, three men were hiking and unexpectedly came upon a large raging, violent river. They needed to get to the other side, but had no idea of how to do so. The first man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength to cross this river." Poof! God gave him big arms and strong legs, and he was able to swim across the river in about two hours, after almost drowning a couple of times.

Seeing this, the second man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength ..and the tools to cross this river." Poof! God gave him a rowboat and he was able to row across the river in about an hour, after almost capsizing the boat a couple of times.

The third man had seen how this worked out for the other two, so he also prayed to God saying, "Please God, give me the strength and the tools...and the intelligence ... to cross this river." And poof! God turned him into a woman. She looked at the map, hiked upstream a couple of hundred yards, then walked across the bridge.

SEND THIS TO A SMART WOMAN WHO NEEDS A LAUGH AND TO THE GUYS YOU THINK CAN HANDLE IT!

Shelley,

What do you think?

Beez,

Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have
prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.

While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire
congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel our
personal needs are being met by Ernie and the example he provides.

We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and
consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult
transition at ACEC.  We feel that while Ernie's sermons may be hard to
follow at times and that he is not the most outgoing person, we never have
questioned his sincerity or dedication for this church.

Having said this, we realize that we don't have the day to day contact with
Ernie that seems to be a component of the problem.  Furthermore, I don't
believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if this
church is to be the kind of church we hope it will be.  Therefore, I guess
my official position is that Ernie has my family's support, but AUMC is our
home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take. 

Kim

Shelley,

Mid-La schedules all of their gas at the Port Allen point but they may split their takes during the day across Port Hudson, Port Allen, and/or E. Baton Rouge. All 3 points are in the same area and combined under the OBA ofr a net imbalance.

Thanks,  Tim

Tim,

Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.  How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.  Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?  How big is this point?

Apparently, my BlackBerry message from last evening informing you of me not coming into the office this morning didn't go through... 
 
I scratched my cornea playing basketball on Sunday evening and my eye has been very sore since.  I have an eye doctor's appointment at 11:00.  If he allows me to drive in, I will be in this afternoon.  If not, I will log on from home and do what I can related to our project.

Pipelines, power keeping Enron afloat through bankruptcy

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s pipelines may not be as sexy as the company's self-touted ability to create lucrative commodity markets, but they aren't bankrupt. 
Pipelines and power plants are the company's main source of steady income these days. They also will be at the core of the humbled Enron that officials hope will emerge - with a new name - from the largest bankruptcy in history.
"It's going to be an uphill battle in persuading the creditors that it's a reorganizable platform," restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, Enron's interim chief executive, said in a voicemail Friday to employees. 
"We've got a tremendous sales job in front of us," Cooper said. 
Earlier this month Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg launched a new trading operation, UBS Warburg Energy, with a work force comprised mostly of about 625 former Enron traders and support staff. UBS Warburg paid nothing up front for what used to be the source of most of Enron's income but agreed to give Enron 33 percent of the new organization's profits. 
Enron agreed before filing for bankruptcy in December to sell its Portland General Electric Co. utility to Portland, Ore.-based Northwest Natural Gas Co. The utility will remain a revenue generator for Enron until the sale closes in the third or fourth quarter this year. 
Enron is trying to unload money-losing ventures, such as its broadband unit with its 18,000-mile fiber optic network. This week the company sold its wind power subsidiary to General Electric Co. for an undisclosed price, and its oil and gas assets in India to Britian's BG Group PLC for $350 million. 
While Houston-based Dynegy, Inc. last month acquired Enron's largest asset, the 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas pipeline, Enron still operates 11,000 miles of other pipelines in the U.S. that aren't part of its bankruptcy, spokesman John Ambler said. 
He said the company has yet to decide what to sell among its international power, oil and gas assets, but operations in Brazil and Bolivia are the most likely keepers, he said. 
"These are ongoing operations that are not party to the bankruptcy and they are all bringing in good returns and cash flows," Ambler said. 
John McCormack, senior vice president and head of the energy practice at New York corporate financial advisor Stern Stewart & Co., said Friday Enron creditors stand to get more cents on the dollar if they accept equity in those assets with the reorganized company. 
"I have no doubt that there are significant pieces of Enron businesses that are worth a lot more alive than dead," McCormack said. 
Anthony Sabino, a bankruptcy professor specializing in oil and gas law at St. John's University School of Law, said the pipelines and power operations may appear pitiful next to the billions of dollars in debt owed to Enron's 800-plus creditors. But they are steady. 
"It may not be flashy, but that's good money that comes in month after month," Sabino said. "Chances are creditors will go for something like cash up front, some payments over time and probably a lot of equity in the newly reorganized company." 
A key element to Enron's survival is whether workers at those operations stick with the company through bankruptcy. 
Enron officials Friday presented a plan to pay retention bonuses and severance packages to current employees to the creditors committee, according to Cooper's voicemail. If approved, he said the plan will later be presented to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez. 
"At the moment I can't make any assurances relative to ongoing employment, and certainly there's nothing I can do to replace what many of you have lost," Cooper told employees. 
Enron imploded last year amid revelations of accounting abuses and financial partnerships used to hide debt and inflate profits. More than one-fifth of the company's workforce of 25,000 abruptly was laid off, and workers with 401(k) accounts loaded with Enron stock evaporated when shares dropped to less than a dollar. 
In addition to a new name - which has yet to be determined - Enron is planning to find new digs in the next year or two to match its pared-down needs, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Enron leases the 50-story glass tower in downtown Houston that houses its headquarters. The company owns, and has for sale, a new $200 million, 40-story glass tower across the street, Palmer said. UBS Warburg Energy is leasing two trading floors in the new building. 
Enron's Houston workforce dwindled to less than 3,000 after 4,500 workers were laid off after the bankruptcy filing and others have since quit. That leaves a lot of empty space on near-empty floors, Palmer said. 
Enron isn't shopping for smaller offices yet but Cooper said remaining workers will soon be consolidated. 
"We can all be together, and people aren't going to be lonely and hanging out there occupying little spaces on big floors," he told workers.

USA: U.S. FERC admits 25 contacts with Enron officials.

02/22/2002 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2002. 
(Refiles with new slug, previous UTILITIES-FERC-ENRON) 
By Chris Baltimore 
WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Under fire from U.S. lawmakers for being too cozy with Enron Corp. , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said in a letter released on Friday that its commissioners and senior staff members had contact 25 times with the bankrupt company's executives between August 2000 and June 2001. 
The meetings did not include new FERC Chairman Pat Wood, who is facing criticism that he was too close to the bankrupt energy giant. 
Deflecting criticism, Wood denied that Enron "has had any undue influence on the decision-making process" at FERC. 
"The agency's decisions have not been compromised or otherwise improperly shaped" by Enron contacts, he wrote in a letter to California Senator Barbara Boxer made available on Friday. 
Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation whose stock was a Wall Street darling, spent lavishly on lobbyists who championed restructuring legislation. 
Former Enron Chairman Ken Lay urged President George W. Bush to appoint Wood to his current position. Enron also backed Wood's previous appointment as the head of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. 
Rep. Henry Waxman of California has also asked Wood to disclose his Enron contacts. Last week, Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell wrote to urge Wood to resign. 
The time period of Boxer's inquiry "effectively predates my tenure," Wood wrote, pegging his arrival at the agency on June 5, 2001. Wood became chairman in September. 
Wood's letter was in response to a request Boxer made on January 31. In a response to Wood's letter, Boxer said that "decision makers at FERC were wined and dined by Enron both in Washington and Texas in an obvious effort ... to control all aspects of America's energy policy." 
NUMEROUS MEETINGS CITED 
As evidence, Boxer pointed to numerous meetings between Enron officials and FERC staff, including FERC commissioners Linda Breathitt and William Massey, both Democratic nominees to the commission, and senior FERC officials. 
Republican Nora Brownell, also a target of criticism for her support of electricity deregulation while a Pennsylvania utility commissioner, reported no Enron contact. 
In the letter, Wood described various meetings with Enron officials to discuss electricity deregulation and other issues, and some FERC officials toured Enron's trading floor in Houston. 
During the period in question, Boxer accused FERC of sitting idly by while power shortages swept the state, leading to blackouts and soaring power bills for consumers. 
Ironically, Wood and Brownell voted to support price limits on the California market, a position opposed by Enron and Curt Hebert, the previous FERC chairman. 
Boxer also said FERC officials could have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and its own ethics guidelines which restrict contact between federal officials and industry representatives involved in contentious issues. 
Wood said that one of his first acts as chairman was to order ethics training for all FERC staff, and said he has "stressed strict compliance with the Federal government's ethics rules," including the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Responding to Boxer's statement, a FERC spokesman denied any improper actions by any agency officials. "What is not permitted is to talk to a company about a contested or on-the-record proceeding and to my knowledge we have played by the rules," he said. 
"We would be remiss in our duties if from time to time the regulators didn't talk to one of the largest owners of gas pipelines in the United States," he said. 
Wood has had three contacts with Enron officials while at FERC, including a call from Enron's Lay on Nov. 11, which he did not return, the spokesman said. Lay made the call two days after Enron agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion, a deal Dynegy later scuttled. 
FERC said its contact with Enron included: 
* Linda K. Breathitt, commissioner: met five times with Enron executives including Rick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of government affairs. Discussion included general electricity deregulation, regional transmission organizations, transmission access issues and tariff reform 
* Daniel L. Larcamp, director of markets, tariffs and rates: met five times with FERC officials, including former Enron chief executive Jeff Skilling; toured Enron trading floor twice in July and December 2000, met with Stan Horton of Enron Pipeline Group, Shapiro. 
* William Massey, commissioner: met six times with Enron officials, including Stan Horton (then also serving as chair of the Gas Industry Standards Board), and Eugene Lockhart, president of Enron unit New Power Co.; "perhaps" had telephone call with Skilling.



Paper - Nuon interested in taking over from Azurix .

Azurix Corp.AZXNuon 
Dutch energy and water company Nuon could take over from Argentina's Buenos Aires province waterworks concessionaire Azurix BA, when the latter's contract ends March 2, according to Argentine paper El Cronista citing unnamed Azurix sources. 
A Nuon spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports when contacted by BNamericas. The spokesperson did not comment further, and said the company is not aware of the press report. 
An announcement is expected in the coming days regarding the future of the province's waterworks services, and until a definite course of action is taken, the province will take over as service provider. Azurix was to have stepped down January 2. 
Azurix is asking US$150mn-200mn in compensation, of the US$438mn concession rights it paid in advance and another US$100mn in investments and operational issues. 
Azurix , which has been plagued with quality and service related problems, began its 30-year concession to serve 2.5 million residents of 49 districts in 1999, but called short its tenure due to the province's alleged "serious breaches" of concession terms.

BG India E&P, LNG Invest To More Than Double Over 3-5 Yrs

02/25/2002 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) will more than double its investment in India over the next three to five years, the company's Indian unit said Monday. 
BG will raise its investment to US$1.3 billion from the estimated US$500 million it currently holds, targeting the upstream oil and gas sector and the liquified natural gas business. 
BG is expanding its presence in India through its Indian unit - British Gas India Pvt. 
It recently acquired Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) upstream oil and gas assets for US$350 million and is developing an LNG import terminal at Pipavav port in the western Indian state of Gujarat. 
BG also holds stakes in two Indian gas distribution companies. It is a majority stakeholder in Gujarat Gas Company Ltd. (P.GCC) and joint venture partner in Mahanagar Gas Ltd. holding 50% equity. 
Separately, a BG India spokesman said the company is expected to drill its first exploratory well in the CB-OS/1 block offshore Gujarat this week. BG will drill a further two exploratory wells on the CB-OS/1 block. 
BG plans to invest about US$18 million in the CB-OS/1 exploration block by November this year. 
BG acquired Enron's 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 block last year as part of its US$350 million deal for Enron's 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields offshore Gujarat. 
Although BG finalized earlier this month a renegotiated deal to buy Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India, its dispute with state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) over who will manage the offshore fields remains unresolved.

SINGAPORE: Enron Japan's creditors may be left empty-handed.

02/25/2002 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2002. 
SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Creditors to Enron's Japanese units could be left in the cold as the company's assets may cover little more than the cost of liquidation, a source said Monday. 
Creditors will meet with the administrator of Enron assets on March 27 to find out what, if any, money will be repaid, a source involved in the liquidation process told Reuters by telephone from Tokyo. 
"After that meeting the distribution of the assets to creditors would occur, if there are any. But the prospects are not great. There are not many assets," the source said. 
Creditors to Enron Japan Corp are seeking around three billion yen ($22.4 million), the source said. 
Enron Japan and three other Japanese affiliates of the former U.S. energy giant filed for bankruptcy in early December, one week after the parent company filed for largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The other units are Enron Japan Marketing Corp, Enron Japan Funding Corp and E Power Corp. 
The company's 70-to-80 employees have one month's salary, or about 60 to 70 million yen ($449,000 to $523,000) coming to them. 
"The employee claims for salary and bonuses take first priority," the source said. 
Enron's Japanese assets consist of mostly office equipment and a modest bank deposit, with the value of the company's office lease worth little more than the cost of termination, the source said. 
"The costs to close the office could exceed the overall assets," the source said. 
The value of Enron Japan's assets will be revealed at the creditors meeting. 
The source said Enron's Japanese trading system cost about two billion yen ($15 million) to build, but cannot be sold to generate cash. 
"The trading system can't be sold because it is based on the U.S. system, and they have not given their approval for its sale here in Japan," the source said. 
Enron established a foothold in Japan in 1999 and operated various trading and marketing units in the energy and commodities industries. 
The company had announced plans to build large thermal power plants at four different sites in Japan, but those projects did not leave the drawing table.

Enron Got $1.2B In Loans From US Agencies For Pwr Plants

02/24/2002 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON (AP)--As Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) reached for markets overseas, power plants it helped build from Guatemala to India received $1.2 billion in government-backed loans from two U.S. agencies. 
The Overseas Private Investment Corp. still is owed $453 million from the Enron-related projects while the Export-Import Bank is due $512 million. 
"They're definitely among our top 10 borrowers," OPIC spokesman Larry Spinelli said. 
Though Enron is now bankrupt, four of its projects financed by OPIC are making its payments on time. Regarding a fifth project, Enron and two other U.S. corporations are seeking to have OPIC pay off a huge insurance claim. 
When it filed for bankruptcy in December, Enron was pursuing OPIC help on two more projects in Brazil. Those applications have been abandoned. 
Enron's relationship with the government is part of a two-pronged business strategy. Inside the U.S., Enron has sought to free energy companies from government regulation. Internationally, Enron has embraced Washington's help in the form of federally backed loans and insurance protection. 
The irony is not lost on congressional critics. 
OPIC "gave hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and other support to Enron-related projects during the Clinton administration," said Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee who recently obtained records showing Enron-related projects received $544 million in loans from OPIC. 
Separately, the Ex-Im Bank made more than $650 million in loans to Enron-related projects overseas. 
"These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enron's operation. The disclosure of this information sheds light on the government's actions in support of Enron over the years," Grassley added. 
Enron's bankruptcy does not place the loans in jeopardy. Separately created corporations handled the overseas projects for Enron and other U.S. companies. 
OPIC and Ex-Im loans are backed with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
Though it has just 200 employees, OPIC has deep pockets - a $4 billion reserve that comes from the user fees U.S. businesses pay for its loans and insurance. OPIC operates at no net cost to U.S. taxpayers - the business fees cover its costs - and earned $215 million last year. 
OPIC's loan and insurance portfolio totals $14 billion; the Ex-Im Bank's portfolio exposure is $62 billion. 
A financially troubled Enron plant in India - financed in part with OPIC loans - is cited by congressional critics who say the company has gotten too much government help. 
OPIC provided $160 million to Enron and two other corporations to help build the $2.9 billion Dabhol plant. It now stands idle because prospective customers do not want the power. 
The Ex-Im bank says it is still owed $203 million on the India project, but that it can call on guarantees from five Indian financial institutions for repayment if necessary. 
Enron and the other two companies filed an insurance claim in December asking OPIC to pay $200 million. The claim is based on "political risk insurance" bought at the outset of the Dabhol project. 
The companies say the Indian government has broken promises to stand behind the project, in effect denying the U.S. corporations their asset and therefore requiring OPIC to pay the insurance policy. 
The claims process will take months to resolve. 
The other four Enron projects that got OPIC money are operating successfully and are paying back their loans in a timely fashion. The payback comes from the revenue coming into the operating power plants. 
Those power plants are in the Philippines, Turkey, Venezuela and Guatemala. The Ex-Im Banks Enron-related projects are in Colombia and at the same plants that OPIC is helping in Turkey and Venezuela. 
Enron's bankruptcy stopped two OPIC applications in their tracks: two power projects in Brazil that would have received $390 million in OPIC loans. 



UK's BG CEO To Raise Field Mgmt Row With India Govt Tue

02/25/2002 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Frank Chapman, chief executive of U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG), will raise a dispute over the management of Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) recently-acquired Indian upstream assets when he meets Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik Tuesday, government and industry sources said late Monday. 
"That should definitely come up," said a New Delhi-based Petroleum Ministry source, referring to BG's dispute with India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) on the management rights, or operatorship, of Enron's offshore oil and gas fields. 
Earlier this month, BG finalized a renegotiated deal to buy Enron's 30% equity stake in the offshore Panna, Mukta and Tapti oil and natural gas fields located off India's western coast for $350 million. 
However, BG's dispute with Oil & Natural Gas Corp. over who ultimately manages the offshore fields is still unresolved. 
Under the new deal with Enron, BG said the management of the offshore oil and gas fields was no longer a precondition for the acquisition. 
Although this represented a reversal from its previous position, when it insisted on managing the fields, BG said it wasn't bowing out of the management race. 
A BG India spokesman said Chapman would arrive Tuesday for a two-day visit, but stressed that the talks would address broad areas. 
"There's no definite agenda. The purpose of the visit is to meet people in the government, BG India staff and top-ranking officials in different companies to talk about current investments and future plans," the spokesman said. 
A source close to BG said the management rights issue would be addressed in an "appropriate forum," but was unable to elaborate. 
"I'm sure it (the management dispute) is going to come up in various meetings, but it wouldn't be correct to label his (Chapman's) visit purely on that basis," the source said. 
     
A spokeswoman at BG's U.K. headquarters in Reading said the company held "ongoing discussions" with BG's joint venture partners Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) on the management rights issue. 
She couldn't comment on the status of the discussions as talks were "commercially confidential." 
Although Oil & Natural Gas Corp. is eager to clinch the management, the company remained open to alternative offers. BG has offered cash and equity stakes in upstream acreages overseas to Oil & Natural Gas Corp. to secure the management rights, but the latter has rejected these offers. 
Friday, India's Financial Express reported BG "will shortly be making a final offer" to its joint venture partners Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries to take over the management of the Mukta, Panna, and Tapti oil and gas fields. BG declined to comment on the report. 
BG is expanding its presence in India through its Indian unit - British Gas India Pvt. The company is developing an LNG import terminal at Pipavav port in the western Indian state of Gujarat. 
BG also holds stakes in two Indian gas distribution companies. It is a majority stakeholder in Gujarat Gas Company Ltd. (P.GCC) and joint venture partner in Mahanagar Gas Ltd. holding 50% equity.

Senate Prepares to Take Up Broad Energy Legislation

02/24/2002 
Dow Jones Business News 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -- The Senate is ready to take up broad energy legislation that has caused splits over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife refuge, automobile gas mileage, and electricity competition in the shadow of Enron Corp.'s collapse. 
Debate expected this week comes nine months after President Bush outlined his plan to increase the nation's energy supply by expanding oil and gas drilling on public land, particularly in ANWR, and rejuvenating nuclear power. 
The House passed its version, but in the Senate, majority Democrats have offered legislation that relies more heavily on conservation. 
The crisis atmosphere has all but disappeared: Energy prices are low, and supplies are plentiful. The urgency to act may have lost steam, say lawmakers and lobbyists. 
President Bush, in a weekend push to promote his plan, dismissed claims that it focuses too much on fossil fuel production and not enough on conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. 
"Conservation technology and renewables are important. Yet they alone cannot solve our energy problems," he said in his weekly radio address. 
During his recent trip to Asia, Mr. Bush stopped in Alaska, where he again stressed the need to drill for oil in ANWR. The idea won mention in his Saturday broadcast, with the president saying drilling can go ahead without hurting the environment, while also providing jobs. 
Environmentalists have pledged to protect ANWR, and some Senate Democrats say they will stall energy legislation if Republicans press the refuge drilling issue -- as most expect them to do. 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D., S.D.), has offered a broad proposal that senators probably will consider this week. 
"We have a real opportunity here," Mr. Daschle said Sunday on ABC's "This Week." 
"There are some big differences between what the Republicans are proposing, which is really the policies of the past, and what the Democrats are proposing, which is a real look to a future for energy policy that is vastly different and exciting." 
At least two weeks of debate are predicted. 
There are "a lot of ways ... this legislation might go off the rails," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), a principal architect of the Democratic bill. 
The House bill, strongly endorsed by Republicans and the White House, tilts toward expanding energy production and would allow ANWR exploration. It also offers billions of dollars in tax subsidies to producers. 
Senate Democrats reject drilling in the refuge and emphasize conservation: sharp increases in fuel economy for automobiles, tougher federal energy efficiency standards and greater support for renewable fuels and natural gas, as opposed to oil. 
Tax breaks in the Democratic proposal -- about $16 billion worth, or roughly half of what the House has offered -- lean more toward conservation and renewable fuel sources as opposed to the oil, gas and nuclear industries focused on in the House version. 
Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska), says drilling in the refuge is essential to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He plans an amendment that would give oil companies access to the refuge's coastal plain, where billions of barrels of oil might be available. 
Sen. Murkowski says he has the majority needed to get it passed, but -- at least not yet -- the 60 votes needed to overcome a sure filibuster. 
Other issues also could scuttle a potential compromise: 
-- Automobile mileage. A Democratic proposal would increase fuel economy by 30%, to an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2013, and remove lower standards now given to sport utility vehicles. Currently, new automobiles are required to meet a fleet average of 27.5 mpg and SUVs and minivans 20.7 mpg. 
-- Ethanol. Farm interests and the oil industry are fighting over whether to increase the use of corn-based ethanol as a motor fuel by establishing a "renewable fuels" requirements for gasoline. 
-- The $16 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. A Democratic version would give more of the money to conservation. Republican proposals tilt toward helping producers. 
-- Electricity competition. With Enron's bankruptcy fresh in their minds, senators will consider how much say the federal government should have over siting transmission lines, managing power grids and monitoring the business practices of large energy holding companies. 
The bill Mr. Daschle is introducing may attract more than 200 amendments. 
"The big question is whether along the way the bill gets killed because it's just too big and cumbersome," says Dan Becker of the Sierra Club. "The conventional wisdom is that this is a bill that's just too heavy to fly." 
With so many contested issues, David Owens of the Edison Electric Institute thinks the bill will bog down. 
The Edison group's member utilities want repeal -- as the bill provides -- of a Depression-era law that restricts the activities of utility holding companies. 
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Republicans have stepped up the argument that more domestic oil production is needed to enhance national security by reducing America's reliance on Middle East oil. 
Drilling foes counter that the refuge doesn't hold enough oil to reduce imports significantly and that tougher fuel economy standards for vehicles would go further in lessening U.S. dependence on foreign sources. 
While Congress works on the legislation, its investigative arm has sued Vice President Dick Cheney to force the release of industry figures who met with his task force as its developed the administration's energy plan. 
The White House has refused to hand over the information, contending that doing so would encroach on the president's ability to get candid views from people outside government.

California Governor Considers Delaying Phasing Out Gas Additive MTBE
By Alexei Barrionuevo

02/22/2002 
Dow Jones Business News 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gray Davis said he is considering delaying a ban on MTBE and would make a final decision within the next 40 days. 
The governor's comments, first made at a press conference on Thursday, follow the release earlier this week of an outside economic analysis that contends the state could face "prolonged shortages" of gasoline and severe price spikes if it goes through with a plan to replace MTBE with ethanol. MTBE, a petrochemical, is also known as methyl tertiary-butyl ether. 
A spokesman for the governor told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that Gov. Davis hopes to decide in the next 40 days whether to delay the ban until 2005. The governor is concerned the state needs more time to put in place the infrastructure it needs to store and ship the ethanol into California from the Midwest, where most of the country's ethanol is produced, the spokesman said. 
A report by Stillwater Associates, an oil-refining consulting firm, recommended delaying the switchover until November of 2005 to give the state adequate time to increase gasoline supplies. The report, presented to the California Energy Commission on Tuesday, said California lacked storage tanks and fuel terminals, particularly in Southern California, that could handle an influx of imported gasoline to make up a gasoline shortage expected to be as great as 5% to 10% of demand. 
The consulting firm suggested restarting idle refining capacity, extending a Texas gasoline pipeline to Phoenix and building more fuel terminals and tank capacity in both Northern and Southern California. 
Gov. Davis ordered a ban on MTBE in 1999 because of concern that it contaminates groundwater. A federal mandate requires the country's most heavily polluted regions to add oxygenates like MTBE and ethanol to gasoline to reduce pollution. After ordering the ban, Gov. Davis, a Democrat, requested a waiver from the 1990 Clean Air Amendments requiring most states' gasoline to include a certain percentage of oxygenates. Both ethanol and MTBE are blended into reformulated gasoline to make it burn more cleanly, reducing smog. Gov. Davis contends studies show that the state's refiners can meet clean-air requirements without using any oxygenate. 
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rejected the governor's waiver request last year. That has left the state with only one alternative to MTBE -- ethanol. Given California's dependence on cars, the state would need 580 million gallons of ethanol a year, or one-third of total U.S. production. Gov. Davis on Thursday blamed "politics in the Midwest" for the rejection of California's waiver request.

One question, on the $1,000,000 margin per additional power plant that we are assuming for growth, is there any capex associated with that growth?  What about any increase in O&M expense?

Thanks,
Jayshree

I will not be in today. I am not feeling well - sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches.  If you need me, you can reach me at home at (281) 359-6258.  I will follow up with my group to make sure I have everything covered for today and prepared for tomorrow's Customer Accounts Meetings.

On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Friday, February 8, 2002

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

Strategic Research Institute Presents:
 
2ND ANNUAL 
 
FUELCELL 
INVESTOR
 A Unique Networking Opportunity To Talk Directly To CEOs Of Virtually All Publicly Traded FC Companies And Other Executives Whose Decisions Can Change The Future Of The Industry!
March 26 - 27, 2002 w The Roosevelt Hotel w New York, NY

The rapidly expanding fuel industry was recently given yet another boost, as the Bush administration last week abandoned a multi-billion dollar, eight-year project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles and instead is throwing its support behind a plan to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells to power the cars of the future.


With the highest possible level of speakers in the fuel cell industry, this summit offers unparallel networking potential. Some major blue chip companies will be presenting, among them Air Products, Dupont, GE Equity, General Motors, Ford and Morgan Stanley.

I spoke to Waymon Pong and Ken Ertman with PG&E today about the Electronic Commerce contract and discussed TW's concerns about the broad nature of the terms. I explained that all TW wanted was to have the ability to Nominate in PG&E's system when TW executed a Market Center deal. It turns out that TW has not lost it's ability to nominated in PG&E's system nor does it depend on TW signing the new contract, the new contract was meant to govern electronic contracts on the Marketing side of the deal. TK can continue to do her deals as she does today (fax and phone) and Customer Services Reps. can go into PG&E's PipeRanger system to nominate contracts. 

If you have any questions please give me a call ext. 37429

Shelley:
Reading an old NNG offering circular and it refers to a Skyline Proposal - did this get final approval from FERC and has it already been fully implemented?

Shelley, I need to go home, everyone is mad because I'm spreading germs.  I don't think I made a very good impression on your sister because I felt so bad.  She is really a great person and very attractive.

I will call you later, Ricki

When: Wednesday, February 20, 2002 11:00 AM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where: Car pool out to the Hangar

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


We will car pool out to the Hangar, leaving around 11AM and arriving by 11:30. We will provide you with driving directions. We'll do a quick walk-through, demonstrate connectivity to the business and Gas Control systems, and then have a working lunch (catered in from Jason's deli) in the 2nd floor conference room. We'll be reviewing the room layouts and the activation and setup process. I would expect to be back in the office by 1PM, but no later than 2PM.

Please make arrangements with your team for car pooling out. It would be good practice to drive out if you haven't been out to the Hangar before.

The February EC meeting (wholesale gas quadrant) will be held Thursday, Feb 21.  The agenda is light; I'll attend via conference call.  I want to mention a couple of items.

A vote will be taken to change the version 1.5 'GISB' standards to 'NAESB' standards.  There's been some discussion on the proper way to vote (e.g., 17/2, procedural).  It will probably be a 17/2 vote.  I don't think it matters.  The only issue I see is that people will want to make it clear that this 17/2 vote should not be interpreted as a vote in favor of each and every standard.  It is only a vote in favor of changing the standards to NAESB.  A comment can be made on the record.

The 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas' will be voted.  We have not been involved with or concerned about this document since we will not use it.  If a motion is made to accept it, I plan to vote in favor.  Comments have been submitted and it appears that this recommendation may be sent back to subcommittee for further work.  I'll go along with this if motioned.

Last December the EC adopted revisions to standards based on the recommendations in the Sandia Labs Report.  These revisions have been incorporated into GISB's response document, which has been distributed to the EC.  This response document was received earlier this week; I have not verified GISB's work.  This item is not on the EC agenda, so I don't know the specific intent.  They may want the EC to approve the final version -- which means approving GISB's work.  I have a concern with that type of vote.  They may want the EC to approve the 'Executive Summary' and 'Conclusion' (total 3 pages).  I have no problem with that vote except that these documents have not been updated since the December revisions were made and are no longer correct.  I'll take care of during the EC meeting.  (NOTE: The revisions to standards have not been distributed for ratification.)

The plan is to bring the response document before the Board at their March meeting for "approval".  The response should also be reviewed by the Editorial Review Board.


Thanks,
Theresa

Shelley,

Will you be able to continue executing the Northern Natural Gas Company TPAs?  If not, can you tell me who will so that I can update the TPA on the website.

Thanks,
Mary

I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
maybe you can lead me in the right direction.

I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.

Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
transport the forementioned quality of gas.

If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
me an e-mail.

Thank you.

Jeff Kidd

It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
 
Recognizing this is a difficult time for us all, the Enron Employee Assistance Program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Please call 713.853.6057, or 1.800.345.1391 for assistance.  

Additional information about the program is also available via the Enron intranet site at: <http://hrweb.enron.com/employeeServices/workLife/resourcesReferrals.asp>

Earlier today, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

------------------------------------------------------
Voicemail Transcript - Steve Cooper
February 14, 2002

Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what's going on.

First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They've been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I've just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It's been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.

Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We're beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey's employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I'll keep you up to speed.

We're also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We're initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.

At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it's my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor's committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can't make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.

There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it's not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That's not good news.  It's an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don't want you to be misled and I don't want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don't think there will be.  In particular I don't want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.

The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don't believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I'm absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.

A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.

We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  

And another thing, I've asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.

That's where we stand as of Valentine's Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven't been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.

If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Thanks again so much and I'll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.

Shelley,  Just an FYI--evidently today the media is reporting Enron is moving their location---everyone is asking me where.  Of course, I reply I'm not aware of anything, I'll let you know when I hear something.  Sheila

Kevin,
We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.

I'm confused - I thought we had throughput data on a more timely manner? Is it the specific format that is the problem or the data itself? If we want to estimate it, that would be fine also.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide.  I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001.  Please let me know if you have this information.

Thank you,

"Alternating theory with
hands-on investigations of
applications works great."

"Course spurred many ideas,
very good discussions - liked
the small size of the session."

"I liked how you demonstrated
how the different instruments
related to generation, retail
load, etc."

"Excellent examples and
discussions of hedges."

"I thought that the examples
were on target to what
actually occurs."

I was talking to Anita this morning and she was asking me if I knew what
games we were going to at spring training - she heard an ad or something for
it and it made it sound fun.  I think they are trying to decide what to do
for Spring Break.  They me be planning a Florida Trip.  What should I be
telling her????  So far I have been very vague about it, but at some point
I'm going to have to be more specific.  I don't want to hurt her feelings,
but I'd rather not spend the whole trip with them.

 =09  =09 Spring's just around the corner - time to throw off our coats, sh=
ed our scarves and gloves, and let that happy feeling take over. Something =
truly does come over us, giving us a renewed vigor that puts us in a festiv=
e mood.=09
 =09=20

At this time of year it doesn't take much for some of us to think it's part=
y time! Some of us prefer to be guests, while others prefer to entertain. W=
e label ourselves partygoers or -givers!=20

Recognize yourself? Are you the one who always gives the parties, or the on=
e who loves receiving invitations? If you're the latter, by the time you fe=
el the need to host your own soir?e the former is already having another on=
e! You'll never catch up-these people live to entertain, so enjoy them whil=
e you can!

I have a friend who is a consummate party giver. We were recently invited t=
o a formal affair at her home on the banks of the Hudson River.

She had painstakingly prepared for her annual gala but fell ill just before=
 the guests were to arrive. She was so ill she went upstairs fully dressed,=
 never to return, without having greeted a single guest!

The party had been in the planning for months. The sprawling home was fully=
 decorated. The sit-down dinner for 28 guests was elaborate. Three incredib=
le appetizers, fabulous assorted salads, rack of lamb, and individual choco=
late mousse cakes were to be served.

We all inquired about our hostess's health, but a guest who happened to be =
a doctor checked on her and concluded that, though it was nothing serious, =
she was too ill to come down. Our hostess, however, asked that her door be =
kept ajar so she could hear the laughter from below as she orchestrated the=
 party from her bed!  =09=20

The elegant dinner went off without a hitch and we enjoyed game after game =
of charades with the music playing and the champagne flowing until 4:00 a.m=
.!=20

Elaborate planning is one of the ingredients that make parties and entertai=
ning exciting, but the most casual and impromptu events have remained neare=
st to my heart.

I was about eight years old and lived in a white clapboard house with a pre=
tty green lawn at 1030 Douglas Avenue. One spring day, my best friends and =
I were sitting on the lawn with some cookies when we spotted Buzzy Gerard, =
who lived catty-corner to me.

Buzzy was setting up his lemonade <http://www.domestications.com/product.as=
p?product=3DD370224zz&dept%5Fid=3D16200&parentname=3DTabletop&featurename=
=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML03-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> stand. It was his sprin=
gtime thing. It wouldn't matter much, and I certainly wouldn't be rememberi=
ng this now, except for the fact that Buzzy and I were great competitors. W=
hat began with entertaining my friends that afternoon turned into enterpris=
e.

Now, as we all know, summer is the traditional season for a lemonade stand,=
 and of course it did begin as a summer idea until Buzzy moved his set-up d=
ate from June to May, forcing me in turn to put my little red wagon out in =
April!

Buzzy was quite polished, organized, and more than a little vocal when he s=
aw someone coming. Frankly, the only thing that extended the life of my bus=
iness was my mother's idea to include oatmeal cookies with my watered-down =
lemonade as Buzzy adamantly stuck to his "lemonade-only" policy.

However, this vicious competitor's established reputation and aggressive ap=
proach eventually led to me caving in. I didn't mind that he proved victori=
ous. I decided it was much more fun sitting on the front lawn with the girl=
s, giggling, entertaining ourselves with cookies, lemonade and a front-row =
seat as Buzzy trapped every car, bicycle and occasional pedestrian who ente=
red his "victim zone."

Whether your entertaining is formal with kings, or relaxed with the kids on=
 your street (I imagine it's really somewhere in between), the first step i=
s to send out the invitations. Sending the invitations first will make you =
realize the show must go on!

Keeping your entertaining simple, light and casual is a great way to start.=
 People will be more inclined to return the invitation when they're not so =
intimidated.

Here are a few easy-to-implement party ideas to get you started:

Pick a theme - This will make your selection of invitations, d?cor, and men=
u much easier.
Engage your guests - Specify a dress code that complements your theme (like=
 Chinese New Year!). This will energize your guests before they even arrive=
.
Keep it simple - Select food that you can make ahead so you won't be spendi=
ng the whole party in the kitchen.
Go for ambiance - Candles <http://www.domestications.com/product.asp?produc=
t=3D376200zz&dept%5Fid=3D13450&parentname=3D&featurename=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL=
-030602-AHTML04-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> are inexpensive accessories with an atmosp=
here that goes a long way. Back them <http://www.domestications.com/product=

-030602-AHTML06-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> to reflect the romantic lighting.
Enjoy yourself - Remember to make time to enjoy the party and your guests. =
You can host a party without feeling like a caterer.

Why not write me about the easiest party you've ever hosted? Send your stor=
ies and questions to me at tips@domestications.com <mailto:tips@domesticati=

Julee's Tips

Tip #1. Short on glasses for a multi-course dinner? Bring out the long-stem=
med glasses a second time. Fill them with sorbet mixed with fruit and toppe=
d with a decadent chocolate sauce! From champagne to dessert, they truly ar=
e multi-purpose!

Tip #2. Spread your hardware around while creating new looks! Use antique d=
resser-drawer pulls for the bathroom vanity. Go shopping without reading th=
e "standard uses" labels! Ignorance can be bliss.

Why not go with a champagne theme? Use placemats with elegant gold threads =

You can invest in linens and window coverings <http://www.domestications.co=

atting for the framed art <http://domestications.artselect.com/cgi-bin/frSh=
owDepartment?13> in a great accent color. The baby will have lots of toys s=
o why not put them to good use? Hang a high shelf <http://www.domestication=

 display all the little stuffed animals, toys, and blocks until junior is o=
ld enough to play with them. Many large hardware stores sell contact wallpa=

invite Patsy? She really wants to meet Alina.

Thanks.  I will be so glad to be home.  I have a 102 degree fever today and
am counting the minutes til I board that plane.

The shower idea sounds fun.  I would prefer a girl shower if that's okay.
Clothes would be my preferred gift -- she wears a 4T or 5T.  She is very
short for her age, but nearly normal girth.  Medium at Gymboree fits her
fine.

The 19th won't work though, because it's my brother in law Troy's 40th
birthday in Austin.  So hopefully there is another day.


Potential List:
Cyndi
Rosemary
Christi
Michele Turkington
Andrea Flynn
Anita Kudla
Cindy Dick
Vicki Smith 
Karen Ferrazi
Gina Taylor
Debbie Thompson
Rosalia Nolan
Peggy Holmes
Lynn Blair
Donna Scott
Sheila Nacey

This list includes a few ladies that work for me -- last 4 names.   But,
otherwise I decided to skip too many work or church friends.  I think a
small gathering would be more fun.

Hi, our names are mark and tina Haller-Wade.  we are friends with Liz
Gras and we are adopting Anastasia. we  are hoping to adopt a second
child in Tarza while we are there.  We are very interested in Aigerim,
but we want to wait until we visit, meet, and introduce Anastasia to
Aigerim before we decide 100%.  She is the highest on the list of
choices.  we want a child that is close to Anastasia age so they can
play together.
We would really appreciate it if you would tell us about Aigerim and
please send us the pictures.  OUr address is PO Box 1646 Frazier Park,
CA 93225.  thanks so much for your time, mark and tina

Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.  I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.  Please let Ricki know about your availability.

I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.  In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).   Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.  

Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.  Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.  Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.

Thanks

Hey guys,

	I sent an amendment to Dan McCarty, for signoff by the NNG President. last week (before the memo) and was told that Danny would no longer be signing agreements for NNG; Danny instructed me to send the agreements to Dan Dienstbier.  Well, Dan Dienstbier just told me he can't sign them either.  Who is the interim NNG President/General Manager?  Any suggestions?

Craig

Tax gave us the same feedback. Davis had not yet updated the model for this.

Subject: RE: NNG 10 year valuation model

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

It was my understanding that Dynegy would send an e-mail formally documenting their approval.  

Shelley, were they going to send that to you?

Please see below and let me know if you agree with what I thought I heard was approved from our meeting with Dynegy last Thursday. I have included the 3 Gas Control Items requested as if approved.   If all agree upon this list, I will need to put together a spending schedule by month for each line item to be used in the NNG cash management meetings.  Thanks?cvb

the rate model should not be adjusted...the purchaser's tax situation does not automatically
apply to the rate entity acquired...it is on a case by case basis...i highly recommend that
the step up be maintained on a separate entity

I think the deferred taxes are gone for ratemaking purposes, too.  I'm checking with Patty to see how they are handling with MGT and whether we can identify some specific pipeline names from the IRS letter rulings that Dave Borcyk and Robert Guthrie have provided.   The elimination of the deferred tax liabilities ought to result in a larger rate base calculation, but resulting higher rates would certainly be subject to competitive forces.

Tax gave us the same feedback. Davis had not yet updated the model for this.

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

Shelley,
I told Teena I would forward this to you and if you knew this child that you 
would email her with any info, thoughts etc... you had.

I hope things are going well for you. I still would like to chat over the 
phone when you are up to it.

Hi, how's it going? Anything new on your end?
We heard from Ginger that a child named Aigerim who is from Taraz became
available.  She is from a different orphanage in Taraz.  She stayed in
the HOuston Area.  She is Kazak and speaks only Kazak.  She is five and
will turn 6 in March.  Did you meet any the kids from the Houston area.
Tonya Hoppe has sent me lots of pictures.  We are unsure and want to
wait until we are over to find a sibling for Anastasia.
I asked if they had a travel date, and Atwa told us no.  My work is
wanting to know when so they can find a replacement doc.  One of the
ATWA staff is due to travel on FEB 15th and she still does not have a
travel date.  Is this crazy or what?  I wonder if the other agencies
keep you hanging like this or if this is just our luck.   never boring,
tina

I have had planned and scheduled for over a year to be gone February 4-13th.  I will be sailing and will have only emergency contact via the coast guard.  I am available every day next week to answer any questions.  Nancy and Ellis will be in charge in my absence and I have confidence both can handle anything which may come up.   cvb

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 11	
>From 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16

>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.

Gary,

Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy

Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in=
 an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the interc=
om were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was=
 stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became=
 concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours bef=
ore they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 ho=
urs to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the g=
uards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performe=
d on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of =
maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.=20

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes wi=
thout saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mo=
rtem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating defic=
iencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root =
cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in mai=
ntenance and monitoring that may have contributed.=20

Thanks, Gary=20

I think the deferred taxes are gone for ratemaking purposes, too.  I'm checking with Patty to see how they are handling with MGT and whether we can identify some specific pipeline names from the IRS letter rulings that Dave Borcyk and Robert Guthrie have provided.   The elimination of the deferred tax liabilities ought to result in a larger rate base calculation, but resulting higher rates would certainly be subject to competitive forces.

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Subject:	RE: NNG Project Approval Requirements

I agree with your interpretation.

I would recommend that we don't eliminate the "Blanket", but rather arrange a sit down meeting with NNG - Dynegy to explain what each "Blanket" consists of and obtain approval for what we plan to spend within each blanket.   If they place restrictions on the blanket expenditures, then we get those restrictions spelled out and we live within their limits.

We can identify every vehicle that needs replaced in 2002 and the Large Tools.   Computers probably can be justified based on historical turnover, etc.

Subject:	NNG Project Approval Requirements

	Please review the following interpretations of the project approval requirements of the NNG-Dynegy TSA
	(Pages 8 & 9 - Capital Budgets) and advise if this is consistent with the overall intent and management's 
	position.  This interpretation represents the views of those on the "cc" list above and must be communicated 
	to the field personnel and others ASAP.
								     Approval Requirement
		Within Budget Category
			All Discretionary Projects			NNG-Dynegy

			Non Discretionary Projects
			     Less than $25,000				ETS as Operator
			     $25,000 or greater				NNG-Dynegy


		Non Budgeted Projects				NNG-Dynegy

	Previously NNG used blanket project approvals for certain purchases based on the approved budget, as listed
	below, which was setup for expenditure at the beginning of the year.  We think this new approval requirement 
	requires the termination of the use of these blankets or at a minimum require NNG-Dynegy expenditure 
	approval for those dollars remaining to be spent.

		Blanket Projects		         Authorized	      1/30/02 Expenditure
	
		Standby Parts			        $ 14,000,000		$ 8,272,710
		Automobiles				1,974,747		        32,726
		Computer Equip.-Operations		   993,250		        62,189
		Tools & Work Equipment		1,018,856		      138,030


	Finally, projects authorized for expenditure and setup prior to 2/01/02 in the SAP system are considered
	approved, unless directed otherwise.

Per our discussion a few months ago, would you please send us the morning report in excel format so we can extract the data for our studies and graphs?  The last time the morning report was modified, I believe that one of the to-do's on your side was to provide this.

Thanks.  Call if you have questions.  x7707.

I think it would be good for us all to settle on a standard level of daily and monthly tolerance.  

It will be easier to manage the system if we have consistency.

I understand we may need one standard for larger interconnects and one for smaller interconnects.

I discussed wtih Mike before I drafted it.   Trunkline is completely different.   THey are smaller interconnects in constrained areas.    They have a tendency to underdeliver at one of the points.  We don't want to give them alot of slack, but netting together cuts our exposure.   Sheila is Director of Gas Logistics ---- that's who always looked at them before, if at all.

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

Sharon,

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need your authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.

I've enjoyed my share of Super Smash Bros. Melee <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q8M0/ref=mk_del_256924_21> since it came out, but it wasn't until I got into a four-player melee with a few other Amazonians one evening that I truly appreciated the brilliance of the game. The fists fly even faster here than in the Dreamcast's revered Power Stone games, and that speed, combined with the unique humor Nintendo lathers throughout this title, had us laughing our heads off while trying to keep up with the riot. 

Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks this game is the GameCube's killer app. As of this writing, Super Smash Bros. Melee is ranked No. 2 in sales among Amazon.com video games, has an average customer rating of five out of five stars, and has more than 290 unique customer reviews. Bottom line: If you have a GameCube, you've got to get this game. If you already own it, pick up some more controllers and share it with your friends--you won't regret it. Game on! --Porter <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/ATE2O3KMNTSKJ/ref=mk_del_256924_22>

Sonic Boon
 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/255765/ref=mk_del_255765_232207276> Even if you've spent the last decade with one or more of the Big N's controllers in your hands, you probably still know who Sonic is. However, knowing the character is not the same as knowing the game. We're introducing the Nintendo Nation to the little blue hedgehog by showcasing the first two Sonic games for Game Boy Advance and GameCube, which will respectively acquaint you with both the first and most recent installments of the series. We're also including our selective history of Sonic <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/255765/ref=mk_del_255765_242207276> to fill you in on what happened in between.

Adapted from the SNES classic, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UK88/ref=mk_del_256924_33> boasts all 96 levels from the original--from cheery Yoshi's Island through the sprawling Vanilla Dome to the grueling Star Road--as well as the first game's mix of action and problem solving. Perhaps best of all, you can network up to four GBA units via link cables for multiplayer fun.

Accessory Self-Test
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UWMC/ref=mk_del_256924_552207276>You need this accessory if... 


Indigo GameCube controller <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QEFM/ref=mk_del_256924_56>: ...you have friends, siblings, neighbors, or someone special in your life. Many GameCube games support up to four players. Don't be a system hog--learn to play well with others.
Memory Card 59 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QEFG/ref=mk_del_256924_57>: ...you do anything other than play video games (such as sleeping or going outside). Without a memory card, you'll either have to re-tread the same ground over and over again (like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U8EM/ref=mk_del_256924_58>) or set your GameCube on pause for days at a time. In either case, this little number will pay for itself in saved electricity and frustration. 
5-inch monitor (indigo) <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UWMC/ref=mk_del_256924_59>: ...the family TV is occupied with The Sopranos, ER, or some other program. This screen attaches to your GameCube and makes it much more portable. It also includes a cigarette lighter adapter, so you can play in the car (if necessary).
GameCube RF switch/RF modulator <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RL4L/ref=mk_del_256924_60>: ...you're playing on an older TV that doesn't have component (round red, white, and yellow) RCA ports. If you can plug a cable line into that heirloom TV of yours, you can use this product. Of course, you might just want to pick up a new TV <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/172659/ref=mk_del_256924_61> instead. You'd be surprised how good these games look in color.

Sharon

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

Sharon,

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.

The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.  The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.  The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.

Current NNG UAF:
December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
Year to Date:	-0.39%		-5,155,854 DTH

This makes 8 months in a row of high UAF loss for NNG.  

Please try to attend today's UAF to discuss this issue and help put together an action plan to locate and correct problems.

It hasn't been announced yet, but to keep you informed, I have been promoted to Director effective 02/01. I received the official word this morning. Apparently a memo will go out shortly with several promotions listed. There aren't any planned organizational changes, just a title change.

Thank you for all of your support. I've always enjoyed working in and around Gas Control and hope to continue to do so in the future.

Gary

I have reveiwed the GISB standards (with Theresa Hess) and the data elements for the posting of imbalance information associated with netting and trading has a manditory posting requirement which includes the shipper and, if applicable, the shipper's agent for all imbalances.  Therefore, we have not included in NNG's filing a modification to allow for a "trading fee".  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.  Thanks MW

Romantic hideaways need not be lacy and frilly. A perfect example is the Ice House. This is possibly the most unusual, yet delightfully romantic hotel in the world.

What's so special about it? It's made entirely from ice! The floor? Made of ice. The ceiling? Ice. But the bed? You got it - ice! Top to bottom, total ice.	

The Ice House, which has several rooms, is comfortably warm, though I wouldn't recommend going barefoot. Guest accommodations are nice and cozy, with oversized, plush comforters keeping visitors toasty throughout the night. Dozens of candles are the only source of light. They're everywhere - small ones peak out of icy nooks and tall ones stand at attention on the floor. They reflect off the surrounding ice, creating a surreal effect. And even though the light comes from open flame, no, the ceiling doesn't drip on you.

Though a weekend of winter whimsy may be romantic to some, others' idea of a romantic getaway involves warm ocean breezes. In Bali, it's not rare for private villas to be completely open to the soothing winds. Guests drift to sleep with a majestic starlit sky for a ceiling and the soothing sound of waves breaking against the beach to lull them into dreamland. If the warm breezes and sounds of the ocean are still not romantic enough, guests can order all their meals in - or, in this case, is it out?

Regardless of which dream hideaway you prefer, a sanctuary that provides total tranquillity and allows us to forget our "real" lives is the perfect romantic setting.

Though you can spend a lot of time and money creating your own romantic hideaway, there really is no set price tag for creating a personal retreat. It can cost next to nothing, and you can create it in your own home.

What's your most romantic room - typically the bedroom. Not romantic enough? Critique it. What's right? What's wrong? The room definitely needs some thought and a theme. Without a theme, we tend to wander, lose focus, and end up with a hodge-podge.

Then think back to all the romantic locations you've ever visited or wanted to visit. What was it that lingered in your mind and tugged at your heart? Then ponder, "is there anything like that I can bring into my life?" 

To start, begin with a favorite fabric and an exquisite bed or chair and expand from there, ingredient by ingredient. Don't be afraid to bring in fantasy. Yes, fantasy can be in good taste, classic but with a sense of romance. Done correctly, no one will know exactly what your theme or inspirations were. Stay subtle, don't let the room or any part of it scream at you. This way you'll find that you will probably enjoy it for years to come...

Remember, above all, have fun!


Tips By Julee!!!

Tip #1. Bored with winter? Invite a friend over (how about your spouse?) for a traditional afternoon tea. Prepare English tea sandwiches made from watercress, egg salad and cucumber and serve freshly-baked scones topped with Devonshire cream and preserves. Serve with black tea (capful of vanilla) or Jasmine tea. Entertaining a friend with children? Serve young ones hot chocolate, scones and sandwiches of Nutella and bananas (yum!) or ham and cheese. 

Tip #2. Sunny windows destroy fabric and fade paint. Remedy? Keep the view while protecting your furnishings from harmful UV rays. Have glass "film" applied to your windows. There are several choices for degrees of darkness and color. Survey says? People are raving about it!

Tip #3. A room with no windows? Create an illusion with a pair of French doors. Attach them to the wall with gathered fabric hanging behind. Build window seats on either side with a wall-to-wall mirror above each seat. Then paint the walls a light and glossy color to give the room a light and airy feel.


Questions to Julee

Could you tell me the formula used for lamp lighting? How high should the lamp be on a table beside a sofa? On a bedside table? Which is better for reading, a floor lamp with the illumination coming from the top (like a torchiere) or from below (with a traditional shade)?

It is unwise to apply a diehard rule or formula, because the styles of the lamp, the table and the sofa or chairs all contribute to the total picture. Plus, there is more than just function involved. Common sense tells us to be sure the reading light (as opposed to general or accent lighting) is intense and focused on your reading material not on your face. Try out a few lamps until you find one that works.

Ideally, a three-way light is most functional. One turn of the switch shoots (general) light to the ceiling, another turn directs light down and a third, even brighter, allows for tasks. These are often torchieres.


I love the natural looking tortoiseshell (or matchstick) blinds I've been seeing. However, my drapes are floral and are hung from a pewter rod. Are they a good match or are the blinds too rustic for my existing d?cor?

Yes, it is possible to combine tortoiseshell blinds with fabric. Two successful examples would include (a) a patterned fabric in a larger scale than the tortoise, but in the same tone (not darker or lighter colors), or (b) a solid fabric (no obvious pattern) but very textured (nubby) with any color from a natural pallet.


I have adjacent rooms and would like to paint one red and the other blue. Would this interrupt the flow? What do you recommend for accessories and window coverings so these spaces, which open to one another, work well?

First, be certain that your blue and red paints are from the same "season." For example don't use a winter red with a spring blue. Next pick a neutral color that goes well in both rooms. Add a little red into the blue room and blue into the red room and use the neutral color in both. When adding the neutral and the opposing colors to the main color, remember to keep their use minimal. Their purpose is as accent colors and they should be used only in trims, borders, frames, linens, or accessories. The red room should remain primarily a red room.

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

It is our objective to read/process ALL customer charts going forward(November 2001), it was the intent at the time to only process the prior periods in October for MidAmerican and Alliant (IES, Interstate Power and WPS) to address their immediate concerns. If there is any confusion concerning this objective, please do not hesitate to give me a call. thanks fs

           What was inferred by "all", was all of the stations listed on you spreadsheets that you provided in your email of 1/10/01, that made reference  to the fact that all of the stations listed for October's business that required PPAs, would also require PPAs for November and December. I assumed that these stations were the ones that we have issues with.
            Thanks-

Gary, when you said that all December PPA's would be done by the 25th, I think that we are all under the assumption that you mean all meters and not just the lists that we sent you that showed the four customers that we did for October, 2001.  Is that a correct assumption - please let us know?

Thanks,

Raetta

Correction. I reported that in the event that GMS could not process all Dec,. PPAs by the 25th,  we would mobilize personnel to process over the weekend to accommodate a special run that Raetta had indicated could be ran on the 28th to accommodate the Dec. PPAs. This should make us current on all PPAs with the exception of a few that we did not receive charts on.

 on 01/22 that all charts (excluding UCU)are being read for the months of Nov. & Dec. 01.  The chart reading will be complete no later than 01/25 per GMS.  Gas Logistics ran PPA's the night of 01/22.  We should have some preliminary invoices later today to compare numbers.  If you have any questions please give Raetta or myself a call.  j.  floyd

FYI...

I would like to respond asap.  I thought we addressed metering problems at our meeting.  Specifically, they would be getting adjustments.  (How long will estimates be occurring?)

I am going to refer Jeff's Historical Meter Data remarks to Larry Berger.  I am also going to remind Jeff that he was going to get back to us if he wan't any historical data prior to May 2000.

Let's talk this PM so I can respond.

Chris, 

December Invoice
We just went through the December invoices and we incurred DDVC's on 7 days in IES Zone D that we aren't going to pay.  This total is $2207.20

When we looked through the statements we found that at least 15 of the 29 gates were estimated the last half of the month and all of our DDVC's occurred between 12/16 and 12/30.  Of the 15 estimated gates, at least 2 were large Zone D gates.  

We were short on 12/16 which was a warm day and long on 12/23 and 12/26-30 which were all cold days so they all fit the pattern of getting charged incorrectly for DDVC because of estimated data.

In addition, we think you may have metering problems at two gates, Rowley(55744) & Vinton(2881).  Rowley looks like it quit working intermittently during the month.  We have some metering ourselves that matches fairly well some days and is way off others and ours looks more correct.  Vinton matches our data pretty well for the first half of the month, but in the last half of the month something looks wrong.  You flat lined the last half of the month, but your total for that period is about 1/2 of what we got.  Your metering group can contact Anita Archibold (608-286-2583) to get our data.  We only have data at four Zone D gates and half of those looked wrong....scary.

We haven't looked at Zone BC yet because we didn't get DDVC's, but are planning too.  

Historical Metering Data
Your metering group did help me download data gate data for last winter to get historical use data electronically.  However, I still don't have anything for the year before.  There are two problems however with the winter I did get.

1) The download works very inconsistently.  Sometimes you have to try many times to get the download to work.

2)  You can't download the actual current data and get it in one report, you can only download whatever was in the bill that month.  For instance, if you want to know what the actual gate station use was for Dec 2000 you would first download that month.  The problem is you won't get any data from corrections that occurred later and in this case, I know that at the very least the Cherokee gate was off by a factor of ten.  That means that I also have to download many months after that and search all of those to find any corrections to a particular meter and cut and paste the data into the original download.
It's an ugly process, to say the least, and it's one I really don't have time to do.

On the positive side, my first couple of contacts with our new rep (Karen) have been good and thanks for your tip that Demarc could get allocated.

Jeff

Just thought I'd let you know I had several people drop by my office today.  They all said they heard you had found a new opportunity and would be leaving us in the near future.

Normally I dispel the rumor and move on, but this came from so many different individuals I wanted you to be aware of the hallway discussion.

I enjoy our working relationship, so selfishly I hope this rumor isn't merited...

Q,

I think I'm going to sweat to death.  It's rainy here and sooooo muggy.
I've done everything wrong in my battle to control jet lag.  I took a short
nap yesterday about 2:00 pm.  I didn't wake up until 7:00 that night.
Needless to say, I did not sleep well last night.  As a result, I'll
struggle to keep my head from crashing thru my computer monitor this
afternoon.  I have not had a chance to look around Jakarta yet, but it is a
huge city.  Our office here is on the 18th / top floor and has a commanding
view of the city.  Jakarta has quite a few tall buildings, but they are
spread out around the city.  Quite a contrast to Houston's skyline.

Is your Sister coming next weekend?  I hope so, as it will be nice for you
to see your sister.

Time to get back to work.  I want you to know that I miss you and I promise
to hurry home.

Love Kim

Danny has been removed and Dan added.
Checked with Craig on the Demarc/Bushton change.  He indicated it had already been incorporated.

Michelle, Linda and I were discussing whether we should remove Danny McCarty from the Northern routing contract approval process.  Since he is an employee of Enron, he is potentially a marketing affiliate.  We believe that we should either set up Dan Dienstbier (if he prefers to be involved in the contract approval process) or stop it at the VP level.  What are your thoughts?

A copy of our current policy is attached for your reference.

Maria, I've attached below an exchange of Dynegy e-mails on the topic of
the 1 hour advance notice.  My concern, as expressed in the e-mail below,
is the complexity (and cost/benefit) of getting to a real-time, on-line
interactive computer system, versus one that requires some processing time.
I'm not sure how the Northern computer system is designed, but this may be
work raising.   I also raise the issue of how this works with EDI
nominations (assuming anyone is actually using EDI these days).  Again, I'm
not sure if this is relevant to the Northern system, but this reflects my
recollection of the way the pipelines in general used to explain to us how
their systems worked (i.e., batched processing, rather than interactive;
all mandatory fields filled in).  My recollection is dated by a few years,
so pipelines may have changed this once they went on the internet, rather
than EBBs and EDI.

I would also note that this was written before the Northern announcement
was made.  However, I have to admit that all my Dynegy pals have accused me
of going to other side since I've been at IP.

I've fine with your comments.  I'll provide you with my correct address
tomorrow.

Subject:	SLA Refund - heads up


There is a strong possibility that the FERC Order on NNG's SLA Settlement will become FINAL around March 3, 2002.
Then we will have 45 days to repath Nov-Feb Reservation & Commodity invoices for all Firm & Interruptible transport contracts, using the settled rates.  (The SLA Settlement reduces the rates that have been in effect since June, 2001, but it doesn't roll them back  to the RP98-302 rate case rates.)

The timing & process will be similar to what we did in August, 1999.

I would put the revised rates into TRS right after the February Commodity Invoices go out (around 3/12).
The rates will be effective back to 11/1/2001.  We will repath 4 months with several iterations to check discounts and adjust manuals.
Fuel is unaffected.  Storage contracts shouldn't be affected, either.

We will use the February Commodity PPA cycle for the Commodity part of the refund.
We will use the March Reservation PPA for the Reservation part of the refund.
We would probably mail the refund PPA invoices at the end of March, just before the March Reservation Invoices go out on April 1.
The refund dollars would hit the 3/2002 GL.

If we follow the same plan as 8/99, then commodity PPAs will be shut off after the current, 1/2002 commodity invoices.
Any non-SLA related PPAs would have to wait until the March Commodity invoice cycle in April.
If there are pending PPAs that need to be released in this invoice cycle, it would be a good idea to do so.

I'll resurrect the August, 1999 schedule and modify it later in the week.  Then, we can schedule a preliminary meeting to figure out what needs to happen.

If someone protests the SLA order in the next month, this schedule would be delayed, but we should probably start getting things in place.

Danny should no longer receive any Northern contracts to review or sign off on-  We will need to replace with Dan Dienstbier, who fornuately the policy incorporates.  I do believe that there had been a change on the Demarc/Bushton policy-  need to find and incorporate-  MK

Subject:	NNG Contract Routing Procedure Change

Michelle, Linda and I were discussing whether we should remove Danny McCarty from the Northern routing contract approval process.  Since he is an employee of Enron, he is potentially a marketing affiliate.  We believe that we should either set up Dan Dienstbier (if he prefers to be involved in the contract approval process) or stop it at the VP level.  What are your thoughts?

A copy of our current policy is attached for your reference.

Rick

    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

                                                                                                                                                   Thanks Ron Spain

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

We will continue to track the receipt of late charts until all are received.  At this time, it is difficult to determine if the problem is with incoming mail from the field, Houston mail or Enron mail delivery.

Will keep you posted as we proceed.

Don,

GMS began tracking late NNG charts for January's close at noon on February 5, 2002.  One-hundred and eighty eight charts were received after the noon deadline on February 5th.  No charts were received on February 6th and none received as of noon today.  Many charts are still outstanding.

Two-hundred fifty-eight chart envelopes were retrieved from the Houston Office, this afternoon and are now in the hands of GMS.  There are indications that some of the charts have been in the post office since February 4th.  The postal account had been financially depleted for two to three weeks   Enron Property Management will replenish the account no later than Thursday of this week and will put in place the necessary controls to ensure the account is always funded therefore no more charts should be held hostage.

If you have questions, please advise.

Hi Shelley!

Just a note to let you know that I have been looking for work and have applied and interviewed for several positions in gas control.  If you have any other openings available within the pipeline group in scheduling, contracts or accounting, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. 

As you well know, I have a good work history and would be anxious to hear any input from you.  I really do need a job.

Thanks for your time.

Power Plants Outages: 
Real-time Update service and database! 

A Must have for ANY Energy professional!  
  _____  

Dear Shelley Corman 

Energy Argus' Power Plant Outages service now comes complete with real-time updates, sent to you immediately via instant messenger. Now, not only do you get to search and query the Argus site of plants information, including: 

Nuclear units; 
Fossil-fired units; 
New generation; 
Existing capacity; 

You now also get instant updates sent by messenger to you - on the platform of your choice - so can act on the news virtually as it happens. 

Who need this information - and why? 

Analysts and traders need this information: Many of the new proposed plants that were expected to come on line are being cancelled or delayed - meaning that supply will tighten and operating costs will narrow. Each plant outage now has a more severe effect - spiking prices and decreasing supply.

Energy Argus' Power Outages updates give you instant notice of these outages so you can prepare immediately and determine ramifacations on power and fuel prices. 
  
Power industry vendors: Outages mean opportunities - immediate notification means you get your foot in the door first.

ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in=
 an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the interc=
om were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was=
 stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became=
 concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours bef=
ore they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 ho=
urs to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the g=
uards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performe=
d on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of =
maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.=20

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes wi=
thout saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mo=
rtem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating defic=
iencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root =
cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in mai=
ntenance and monitoring that may have contributed.=20

Thanks, Gary=20

Shelley,  There were no penalty invoices issued to Peoples/Teco for the month of January.  The only item that has occurred recently (which really doesn't appear to have been a problem)  Their Jan. reservation invoice was revised and billed with a due date of 2/20 (this is an automatic defualt in TSS & must be overriden).  Thus, they delayed payment until Cynthia followed up when they didn't pay timely.  Otherwise, Cynthia indicates she hasn't had anything significant occur.  Sheila

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Hi! I hope your week has gone well. I'm checking in to see if you have time
tomorrow afternoon to meet for coffee or to otherwise get together. John and
I are doing some yardwork in the morning and he and Miss B will go to his
hockey game in the afternoon -- thus I'llb be free then.

Take care, C

Sorry that was the wrong draft.  Here is the latest.  (I am sure that there will be spelling errors but I am more focused on content and will do a really thorough spell check at the end.)

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Ancillary Services Conference
 
April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado
 
OVERVIEW
 
 
 
As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 
 
 
 
This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

Hi! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend. The weather was simply
beautiful. We did some extensive yardwork. Luckily we didn't plant much
since it is supposed to be chilly this week.

Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music. It was great fun. I'd go
again next weekend!

Let me know which day is best for us to have lunch --Wednesday or Thursday.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
>From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
>From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.

Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.  I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.  Please let Ricki know about your availability.

I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.  In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).   Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.  

Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.  Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.  Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.

Thanks

NNG:
Carlton Resolution continued at 75%
The SOL for Sunday February 10th was pulled.

TW/FGT:
The MOPS outage looks like it will continue through this week due to weather prohibiting the divers from being able to work on the leaks. Approximately 100,000 a day will be cut during this outage. 

There were no significant system issues reported to me this weekend and I received no calls from Reps needing assistance.

Results of Monday meeting:
1)  Marion will continue to maintain a spreadsheet of outstanding shipper receivables for reservation, commodity and cash in/out balances.
2)  Marion will supply John K & Sally with an estimate on Friday for the upcoming week of expected cash flow based on the history of cash received (using Jerry's existing spreadsheet) and maintaining an ongoing daily cash receipts balance (at a high level).
3)  Reviewing whether the invoice due date can be moved up to follow tariff, ie, net 10 days falls on Sunday, can  invoice due date be on Friday (9th) prior to Sunday (11th).
4)  Jerry S will follow up with the SAP IT team to automate his report after reviewing report requirements with John K, Rick & myself.
5)  MS Reps will follow up with customers sending cash in to Enron office rather than lockbox or by wire.
 
We plan to give this a try for a month.  If problem arise, we will reconsider the decisions.

I think the deferred taxes are gone for ratemaking purposes, too.  I'm checking with Patty to see how they are handling with MGT and whether we can identify some specific pipeline names from the IRS letter rulings that Dave Borcyk and Robert Guthrie have provided.   The elimination of the deferred tax liabilities ought to result in a larger rate base calculation, but resulting higher rates would certainly be subject to competitive forces.

Tax gave us the same feedback. Davis had not yet updated the model for this.

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

Suzanne Vann with Corp Development got my name from Gary Fitch and called t=
o discuss our use of the Hangar. Corp Devel is reviewing the benefits and c=
osts of the remaining 2 planes, as well as the Hangar. If they decide to se=
ll the planes, then they will cancel the lease for the Hangar. If they deci=
de to keep 1 plane, it could go either way. If they decide to keep both pla=
nes, the assumption is that they will keep the Hangar. The lease is approx.=
 $180K. I described our use of the Hangar as the Interim Offsite for Gas Lo=
gistic's Business and Gas Control functions and will send her the Visio dra=
wings showing the configuration of the rooms we are using. I also described=
 the T1 network connections between the Hangar and downtown and the Hangar =
and Omaha. She said that our use of the facility would probably be listed a=
s one of the benefits and she assumed there would be some costs to relocate=
 the Interim Offsite if they cancel the lease. Although she didn't offer an=
y hint as to what the decision might be, she said it would be a while befor=
e the decision was made, and she suggested we might want to think about alt=
ernatives just in case. I did tell her that Shelley may want to give her a =
call as well.

Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.  I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.  Please let Ricki know about your availability.

I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.  In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).   Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.  

Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.  Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.  Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.

Thanks

Lynn, I understand Ashley came home this afternoon and both grandchildren are staying with Joe & Ruby -- apparently their son and daughter-in-law are also staying there -- they have to keep the girls separated.  Ashley was the one who had more breathing difficulties when the twins were first born.  We have stressed to Joe who is scheduled to work Saturday that we can cover the hours if he's needed at home.  So far he feels certain there is no difficulty with his being here -- we are ready in any event.

Will keep you posted.

fyi:  One of Joe's twin grandchildren (I believe the twins were born around September or October) is currently in the hospital (about the 4th day).  Ashley is the baby who has had some breathing difficulty from time to time.  She has had a viral infection and due to the shallow breathing, the doctor is keeping her in the hospital.  The doctor had said that shallow breathing often progresses into SIDS.

Felt all of you would like to be aware -- presently Joe and Ruby have the other grandchild with them.  Will keep you informed but know Joe would appreciate your prayers.

Energy and Power Consumers and Producers? 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year? Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001? Did you take undue credit risk because you did not know how to estimate exposure? Are you comforting yourself with the fact that you did not hedge to make money? Let's face it - you did not hedge to lose money either.

Although it is only Tuesday, I am already trying to plan for the weekend.
John's brother Gib is visiting us and we were hoping to see you (sans Kim)
on Saturday for dinner ... at Lupe's? 

How is it going in Kim's absence? If I can assist in any way, please let me
know.

Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,
Kevin

Sharon

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.

Have taken our info memo and broadened it substantially to pull in more info for the business plan (risks, liquidity/capital resources,selected historical data). I want to include a page on market strategy - is project MAX a real expansion and if so, who has data on it? The NNG bus plan is in very good shape thanks to the work jayshree and davis did on the info memo! I will have first draft by wed.

Gary,

Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in=
 an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the interc=
om were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was=
 stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became=
 concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours bef=
ore they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 ho=
urs to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the g=
uards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performe=
d on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of =
maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.=20

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes wi=
thout saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mo=
rtem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating defic=
iencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root =
cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in mai=
ntenance and monitoring that may have contributed.=20

Thanks, Gary=20

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need you authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.

Donna please check with Shelley and if ok, please send out to all the Gas Logistics group.  Thanks?cvb

There have been a number of questions concerning the Ray Bowen's memo of February 11th regarding approvals for purchases (iPayit) and payments (iBuyit) and approvals for Employee Expense reports.  ETS is trying to change the procedures which were put in place so what I state today could be different tomorrow.

As of February 20, 2002 the following procedures are to be followed for the Gas Logistics community:

	All iBuyit items must be approved by Rod Hayslett.  The iBuyit system has been or is in the process of being changed so that Rod has the final approval before orders are placed.  I believe our ETS buyers are ensuring that all requests are approved by Rod.  To help Rod out it would be in your best interest to state a business need for the requested purchase as well as company, cost center and under which category in the budget the item was budgeted for (Approved Project Number; Blanket number; expense GL acct (52504500 - pc equipment), etc.  Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals. IT should proceed with its normal chain of approval (supervisor, Director, VP etc.) prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.

	All iPayit items must be coded and sent to Rod Hayslett for final approval.  As in the iBuyit system, Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.

	All IT Employee Expense reports must be coded and sent to Shelley Corman for final approval.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Shelley for her final approval.

	Other Items:
?	All invoices should be processed in iPayit and should be sent to accounts payable far enough in advance so that they may be processed in the system.
?	For invoices that must be paid in 2-7 days, sign-off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and a Cash Management Committee member (see me and I will help walk you through the rest once sign off is received from Shelley and Rod).  Urgent Payment Request form filled out.
?	For same day payment, sign off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and George Wasaff.  The cut off time for sending current day payments to the AP processing team is 12:00 noon and for next day payments 3:00pm.  Again see me after signatures and I will walk you through the process. Urgent Payment request Form filled out.
?	Urgent Payment Request Forms are located on the ISC Website and the iBuyit website.  These forms are used for all exception payments i.e. payments outside of iPayit.

I hope this helps.   cvb

fyi:  One of Joe's twin grandchildren (I believe the twins were born around September or October) is currently in the hospital (about the 4th day).  Ashley is the baby who has had some breathing difficulty from time to time.  She has had a viral infection and due to the shallow breathing, the doctor is keeping her in the hospital.  The doctor had said that shallow breathing often progresses into SIDS.

Felt all of you would like to be aware -- presently Joe and Ruby have the other grandchild with them.  Will keep you informed but know Joe would appreciate your prayers.

Results of Monday meeting:
1)  Marion will continue to maintain a spreadsheet of outstanding shipper receivables for reservation, commodity and cash in/out balances.
2)  Marion will supply John K & Sally with an estimate on Friday for the upcoming week of expected cash flow based on the history of cash received (using Jerry's existing spreadsheet) and maintaining an ongoing daily cash receipts balance (at a high level).
3)  Reviewing whether the invoice due date can be moved up to follow tariff, ie, net 10 days falls on Sunday, can  invoice due date be on Friday (9th) prior to Sunday (11th).
4)  Jerry S will follow up with the SAP IT team to automate his report after reviewing report requirements with John K, Rick & myself.
5)  MS Reps will follow up with customers sending cash in to Enron office rather than lockbox or by wire.
 
We plan to give this a try for a month.  If problem arise, we will reconsider the decisions.

Randy,

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed. 

As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes without saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mortem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating deficiencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in maintenance and monitoring that may have contributed. 

Thanks, Gary

Caroline, 
We need to get together to discuss the ownership and rights to use for our new software products like Contracts, Capacity Release, Capacity Analysis and Rates & Revenue.  My assumption is that NNG has the rights to use and will be able to get the source code for customization of this software because of the financial contribution that they have made; however, after talking to Colleen Raker today, she said we need to get together and create some type of written agreement between all the pipes for who owns and has the right to the source code for these software products.  I know you are out until the 14th so let's plan to get together the following week to address.  Thanks.

Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.

Currently, we are researching ways to enhance our Internet services to you and making our FERC
archives searchable and would like your feedback  Would this service be of interest to you and what  features or functions would best serve you? 

After our previous e-mail we had several questions concerning upgrading to the new Real One player. 

  1.  Do you have to upgrade to the new Real One player to view FERC our programming? 

  No, you can still use Real Player. We suggested that you upgrade because of the new features Real   One offers making it easier to view the agenda while playing the archive.  When using a previous  version of Real you just have to go back and forth between the two windows (browser & player) to see the agenda.    The new player just makes it easier and more convenient for you to view the agenda and video in one window. 

  2.  When I go to download the Real One they want my credit card number.  How do I get the Free
  Real One Player? 

Unfortunately, Real does not make finding the Real One Free player easy.  When you go to the web page (www.real.com <http://www.real.com/>) go about half way down and on a gray bar going across the page you will see  "Our Free Player", click that link and you will be taken to another page.  On the new page look in the lower right hand corner toward the bottom of page and you will see a link "Download the Free RealOne Player Only".  You will then need to fill out their paperwork (choose the option that you are a new user) and register but will not be charged. 

As always, if you have any questions or need help downloading or installing the Real Player, please contact our office at 703-993-3100 or capcon@gmu.edu. 

  Thank you

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

Steve, I am in full support of this provision. The net result being that it would make it less marketable for excess capacity in one zone moving into another.

Thanks so much for lunch yesterday!

I looked up Nancy Kline's info. She is a nurse practitioner who also has a
Ph.D. -- a real underachiever.

I'm actually working with Mark Kline on their idea for an Ambassador Doll.
We are trademarking it. 

Have a good day.

An action item coming out of our tour and discussion at the Hangar on Wednesday was for the two of you to discuss what offsite testing activities we need to pursue this year. On the table are the annual Technical Test and the Business Test for the Omaha Offsite, and a Drill
for the new Interim Offsite at the Hangar. We generally start preparation for the Technical Test several months in advance, and it is a fairly significant effort for both the Gas Control and Business systems.

I do feel strongly that we need to complete a Technical Test of the Omaha Offsite. It is important for Business Continuity, but probably more important to insure that we have a stable and fully configured production environment prior to beginning any activities to split out NNG or move out of the Enron Building. 

Let me know how to proceed.

Thanks, Gary

Friends & Family,  My cousin sent this to me today and I know it touched me. How would our children react to this situation?  I pray they would do the same. I pray this is what we are teaching them, love and humanity.  
 
Subject: FW: Food For Thought

Don't look for a punch line. There isn't one. Read it anyway. My question to
all of you is: Would you have made the same choice?  At a fundraising dinner
for a school that serves learning disabled children, the father of one of
the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who
attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a
question. "When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature
does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay cannot learn things as other
children do. He cannot understand things as other children do Where is the
natural order of things in my son?" The audience was stilled by the query.
The father continued. "I believe, that when a child like Shay comes into the
world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it
comes, in the way other people treat that child." Then he told the followingstory:

Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were
playing baseball. Shay asked, "Do you think they'll let me play?"  Shay's
father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their
team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play,
it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging. Shay's father approached
one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play. The boy looked
around for guidance and, getting none, he took matters into his own hands
and said, "We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I
guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth
inning." In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few
runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put
on a glove and played in the outfield. Even though no hits came his way, he
was obviously ecstatic just to be! in the game and on the field, grinning
from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands.  In the bottom
of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the
bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled
to be next at bat. At this juncture, let Shay bat and give away their chance
to win the game?  Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a
hit was all but
impossible cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much
less connect with the ball. However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the
pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at
least be able to make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily
and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball
softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a
slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher picked! up the soft
grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay
would have been out and that would have been the end of the game. Instead,
the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on a high arc to
right field, far beyond the reach of the first baseman. Everyone started
yelling," Shay, run to first! Run to first!"  Never in his life had Shay
ever made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and
startled; Everyone yelled,
"Run to second, run to second!" By the time Shay rounded first base, the
right fielder had the ball. He could have thrown the ball to the
second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and
intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.
Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled
the bases toward home.  Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran
to him, turned h! im in the direction of third base, and
shouted, "Run to third!" As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams
were screaming, "Shay, run home!" Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate,
and was cheered as the hero who hit the "grand slam" and won the game for
his team."That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his
face, "the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and
humanity
into this world."

AND, NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY:

We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought,
but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people think twice
about sharing. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through
cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in
our schools and workplaces. If you're thinking about forwarding this
message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people on your
address list that a! ren't the "appropriate" ones to receive this type of
message. Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a
difference. We all have
thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the "natural
order of things."  So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people
present us with a choice:  Do we pass along a little spark of love and
humanity or do we pass up that opportunity, and leave the world a little bit
colder in the process?

In regard to our meeting yesterday, detail for lockbox information is not received until mid afternoon the day after deposits are made. The detail for the 72,107.31 deposit will not be received until sometime this afternoon.  This amount is yesterday's deposit, 2/19.  Also, as discussed in yesterday's meeting your request for detail on the $36,513.47 2/1 item is an "ACT Transfer CR", and is not an incoming wire. It will not be recorded as an incoming payment. In prior discussions and emails,  we have indicated the $350.00 on 2/1 is a  NON TRADE item; the $600.00 on 2/12 is a NON TRADE item.  The $40,807.85 wire received 2/15 from FPL is for customer 700000031, and was applied to the appropriate misc invoices on 2/19.

In the future in viewing deposit amounts for the lockboxes and we indicate there are no trade deposits, the items will be treated as Non Trade items. 

I trust this will resolve the outstanding questions.

thanks,

sandy

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

Don't know either, but the way the question was asked was very complimentary towards what you add here.  I'll make sure things settle down, at least regarding this issue, here on 40.

Subject: RE: NNG 10 year valuation model

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Please note Carla McGinley, an Ashford UMC member and friend of mine, is going on a Walk to Emmaus weekend retreat the middle of March, 2002.  It will be held at the JbarJ Ranch in Sealy.  In an effort to help her sponsor Kathy Eason and to encourage Carla we respectfully ask your assistance as well.

Some of you know Carla very well, others only slightly and some not at all; and yet you do know me.  When I went on my own retreat to Emmaus in 1994 I was incrediably blessed then only to realize over the years since the blessing has continued.  We don't always feel the warmest effects of an effort until God chooses it so. I have since served on many teams over the years and each time I am allowed to be present as a person gets time for her/himself I am blown away by the effects of honest heartfelt prayer in action.  Now that Carla has taken the responsibility and position of coordinating the prayer ministry for our church home, Ashford UMC prayer is requested in her name.  

Would you be so kind to either mail or email an encouraging note, bookmark or other thought to me FOR HER and addressed to her so that I can take the messages to leave for her on the walk.  She will not know of these or receive them until she is on the weekend These messages will mean a lot reminding her of the vastness of her brothers and sisters in Christ in prayer; of God's love sent in many forms and will encourage her as she returns to serve the Lord in her famiily, church and the community. Having thoughts from some who know her and SOME WHO DO NOT will touch her I know. These notes will show her as an agape physical form the unconditional love that God has for us.  Her walk will be March so please forward asap to ensure receipt.  I will be participating as an outside 4th day along with her official sponsor Kathy for those of you that have already gone on the walk...join me/us if you l! ike.  

Kathy Eason is her walk sponser. Prayer for Kathy in her support of Carla, the whole walk team, retreatants and their families as well will be the greatest agape (unconditional love gift).  God bless each of you as you take the time to share ideas, a love in Christ thought, a card or a letter of encouragement for Carla as she spends this time away from the daily world and spends it in the Lord with others on her journey.  Nothing brings the heart more encouragement like an unexpected love in Christ message from another person during this time away from the everyday world.

Feel free to ask others that know Carla to join in the messages and forward to me by early March for delivery mid month.

Please notes mail to me for her:

P.O. Box 441150 Houston, TX  77244-1150  (you may enclose a sealed note for her if you prefer)
or email as follows:  maggiemschf@yahoo.com <mailto:maggiemschf@yahoo.com>

All will be delivered to her in their original form faithfully and to His glory.  serving in Him with Joy, maggie

I thought you would want to know about this traumatic event that happened yesterday to one of the ETS gas controllers.

FYI

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  

We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.

Just in case I don't see you this p.m., Gina Taylor brought around reporters for the the Los Angeles Times and USA Today for a tour of Gas Control this morning. They were in for an interview with Mr. Cooper. The USA Today had a photograher with her and he took several pictures of Gas Control. Gina thought the article would be in Monday's issues. thanks. sj

Subject:	CS 17 Recip Gas Aftercooler Vibration Problem 

After Mike Teals' call this morning about the excessive vibration problem at CS 17, I proceeded with the following actions :

1.	I checked with construction and advised them to remove the 4" blowdown/purge valves at the end of the inlet and outlet gas cooler headers.  This should reduce the worst vibration problems.
2.	I  contacted Marvin Barta with MLB Engineers who performed the acoustical/mechanical piping study for CS 17.  We had implemented his piping recommendations in the drawings.
3.	Marvin Barta, Scott (?). and myself are planning to be at CS 17 on Thursday 2/21 and Friday 2/22 to measure pulsation and vibration levels.   The five units will need to be running  to take these measurements.  Pressure taps need to be used to connect the instruments.  Rich Jackson told me that taps are installed on the inlet lines to the coils and at the cross-over valve.   CS 17 Operations, please identify additional taps on the discharge of the compressor units.  With the pulsation data, we should be able to analyze the vibration problem and make recommendations.  I have not yet verified that the units will be on-line on Thursday and Friday. 
4.	I just received a call at 5:15 PM from Rich Plachy at CS 17.  The station is on line with a 160 psig differential and vibration levels are much lower than this morning.  They are the highest at the end of the cooler.  When the station was shut down this morning because of the excessive vibrations, the differential was at 150 psig.  I believe that the removal of the blowdown valves at the end of the headers contributed to the vibration reduction.    I also believe that the support piers under the two headers are not sufficient and that another pier needs to be installed at the end of each cooler header.  We still intend to travel to CS 17 to collect pulsation data.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Rick

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

Jimmy,  we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing.  Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages.  We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left.  Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss.  Thks! Sheila

Dear Shelly:

Ernie approved the VBS curriculum today...I knew he would but since it was 
not
UMC I needed to have his approval. He got excited about it jus tlike we did. 
I also need to give him some of the "Kids Own Church" stuff to approve as 
well.  Do you have a few copies I could show him?  Ange Grout and Bobbie 
Oldfield are on tap for the third Sundays for Children's Church.  I will call 
the Ackermans tomorrow, did not wish to leave a message so I said I would 
call them tomorrow on the message machine.  I know the call will go well.  
Did you all decide on a date for the meeting for Children's Church leaders?  
I did not catch the date and time.  
Thanks so much,
Patty

	I just wanted to say "Thank You" for all your work in January.  With everything that
	has been going on, you still managed to have zero (0) Customer Service Rep errors
	to be manually scheduled for January business.  From the report it looks like you help
	to minimize Operator and shipper issues as well.

	Great job! Keep up the good work.

	Thanks. Lynn

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need you authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.

the deferred taxes for the regulatory entity would not change...a new valuation entity needs to be established to reflect the tax step up and premium paid...the sum of the two equals the dynegy/nng

Subject:	RE: NNG 10 year valuation model

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,
Kevin

Subject:=09RE: Elevator Maintenance


Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy

I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.

Shelley--If you have time on your schedule, would you also attend this meeting.  The reason I've scheduled this meeting is to determine exactly what it is John Keiser needs for cash flow analysis and what we can do to automate Jerry's process such that it doesn't require so much manual intervention and is more dependable.  (Marion spends too much time reconciling to Jerry's spreadsheet when she needs to be contacting customers for collections.)  I believe Jerry put this together for you, so your thoughts would be appreciated.  Sheila  (We're meeting in EB3907 at 2:30 pm.)

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Anita / Marc,

I have investigated the procedure for picking up Aeros' tickets at the "Will
Call" window, thinking it would be conveniently located at the Campaq
Center.  Much to my surprise, the Aeros' "Will Call" window is located in
their office at Wilcrest and Richmond.  They have four tickets for the Erbs
and three tickets for the Kudlas.  I drive right by their location on my way
home and I plan to pick up my tickets on Thursday evening.  Would you like
me to pick up your tickets also?  If so, do you want all three?  I remember
Marc saying that Anita was not sure if she would be attending.  I still
don't know if Shelley and Alina are going either, but I think they may.
Also, I was going to offer the four Enron tickets to Terrell Hemphill and
family.  Game time Friday is 7:30.  We may be a little late, but that is no
big deal to me.

Please move the attached AR lines items to Enervest - customer #4000002858

These invoices had been billed to Enervest but recorded under ENA's customer number.  In the past, the invoices were paid by ENA; however, the invoices for November and December 2001 will be paid by Enervest.

thanks

I, on behalf of Infinite Energy, would like to offer my deepest sympathies to Richard Blaser, Executive Vice President of Infinite Energy, and his family.  Richard's parents were in a plane crash this past weekend.    
 
Russ and Carol Blaser were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday with his wife by eating out in Cedar Key, Florida.  They flew out to Cedar Key and were intending to fly back to Gainesville after the celebratory dinner.  Russ Blaser was an accomplished and experienced pilot and in fact had participated in many air shows with his stunt plane.   
 
Shortly after takeoff from Cedar Key, the plane Russ was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Richard's mom was killed and his father has not yet been found. 
 
The date for the funeral of Carol Blaser has not yet been set.  I will relay any relevant information regarding funeral arrangements and Russ Blaser's status to those on this email list as they become available.  
 
Please take a moment to think of Rich and his family.
 
Darin

  <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>	Dear Member,

This is one of our favorite times of the year. With the holiday rush behind us, and the spring still several chilly weeks away, February is a wonderful month to settle down indoors with all those books you've had on your reading list. In this issue of the Readers' Advantage Newsletter, enrich your reading with a closer look at some authors you know, and an introduction to some we think you should know about. And don't forget to look in our Great Reads section, where our fiction buyer, Sessalee Hensley, has made her choice of great fiction titles out this month. You'll find all this and more -- enough to make you almost wish February would last longer -- so cozy up and enjoy this month of reading.	   <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>

Andrea Barrett, Map Studies <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>
"I came to writing fiction late, clumsily, and by a process that still remains a bit mysterious even to me," says Andrea Barrett, whose fiction speaks volumes about the ways in which we discover our true passions -- and what it means for Barrett to have found her own. Her latest, Servants of the Map, reveals profound connections between a number of characters who made appearances in her earlier books, Ship Fever and The Voyage of the Narwhal, and is highly recommended reading. We had a chance to talk with Andrea Barrett via email about her writing, her characters, and her latest work, in our exclusive Q&A <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>.

"It's All About the Madeleines," by Anne Ursu <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>
"My novel, Spilling Clarence, is about memory -- or rather it's about remembering, which, I've come to believe, is a different kettle of fish," writes Anne Ursu in our exclusive essay. A selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, Spilling Clarence asks probing questions about the nature of memory -- and why we choose to forget. Read on to find out more about the origins of this very original debut, in "It's All About the Madeleines <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>."

Biography, with Geoffrey Ward <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2>
"Nobody today comes close to Twain," says Geoffrey C. Ward, author of Mark Twain, the companion biography to the Ken Burns documentary film that appeared on PBS in January. Perhaps no author in American history has achieved the international recognition of Mark Twain -- both as a writer and celebrity. Ward, who has collaborated with Burns on legendary projects such as Jazz and The Civil War, now presents us with a wise portrait of a writer whose inimitable wit and insight into the human condition have stood the test of time. In our exclusive Q&A, we asked Geoffrey C. Ward a few questions <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2> about his work with Ken Burns, and about the public and private persona of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain.

A Conversation with Anthony Doerr <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIK0An>
"In a lot of ways, writing is a way for me to see other places in the world that I can't physically go to," says Anthony Doerr, whose debut collection, The Shell Collector, takes his readers from Tanzania to the American West, from Africa to New England. At 28, Doerr has already visited parts of the world many of us may only know through reading. And in his remarkable debut collection of stories, a selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, we see what truths there are to be learned when one has spent time as a stranger in a strange land.

  <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>

Let's be honest, we love chocolate and use every holiday possible as a reason to give and gladly receive the delectable indulgence. But more than any other holiday, Valentine's Day is a great time to give chocolate - not only because of its sweet connotations, but also because of chocolate's historical association with romance. Don't miss our recommendations for some great books to sweeten the gift <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FpW0Ae>! And, thanks to our friends at Godiva, read more about the food that has been linked to love for more than 2000 years.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

I know money is tight and I'd like to address our attendance at upcoming GISB Board and Executive Committee meetings.  Per the new NAESB Bylaws, our seats, and therefore voting rights, are dependent on attendance.  Below is the information I know thus far.

The NAESB Bylaws include minimum requirements for meeting attendance of Board and EC members.  The requirements are the same for Board and EC reps.  Members must attend, in person, at least 25% of scheduled meetings and must participate in at least 75% of such meetings.  Attendance will be reviewed each March 31 and September 30 for the preceding twelve months.

The 2002 meeting schedule has not been finalized (neither dates nor locations).  In the past, all Board meetings and most EC meetings have been held in Houston.  For NAESB, this will change.  For 2002, none of the Board meetings will be in Houston and possibly none of the EC meetings will be in Houston.  Starting in June the EC meetings will probably move to two-day meetings (as they were in the past) because more than one quadrant may be in attendance.  New standards will be brought before the EC for vote.  New quadrants will probably have a flurry of new standards -- hopefully not to the extent we had at the beginning of GISB.  Below is the meeting schedule as I know it thus far:

BOARD
March 7 --- Washington D.C.
June 28 --- TBD
Sept 18 --- Baltimore, MD
Nov 21 --- TBD

EC
Feb 21 --- FP&L in Palm Beach, Florida
April 18 --- TBD
June 13 --- Boeing in Seattle, WA
Aug 8 --- TBD
Oct 17 --- Phoenix, AZ (tentative)
Dec 12 -- looking for host in New York, NY

The Board still has some transition issues to address, but I think a good deal of the transition has been taken care of.  For a while issues will continue to arise as we move through our processes, such as the one regarding GISB Operating Practices that I mentioned in my last update e-mail.

Activity in the EC slowed almost to a stop due in part to the Order 637 work being done by various subcommittees.  This held up the work on requests.  BPS has only a few requests on their plate.  In January, IR should finalize their work on Order 637 and resume work on their backlog of requests.  ETS has approximately 30 requests submitted to GISB; most are in IR.

One thing to watch for in the EC is standards that spill over into the wholesale gas quadrant from other quadrants.  If a standard is being adopted by another quadrant, EC reps in our quadrant can decide that the standard should apply to our quadrant as well.  The vote needed to have our quadrant address the standard is simple majority, which does not require support by the pipeline segment.  The final adoption of the standard requires a 17/2 vote.

New NAESB procedures may also be raised by other quadrants that affect adoption of standards or the organization as a whole.  These would be addressed by either the Board or the EC, depending on the nature of the procedure.

Thanks,
Theresa

FYI - I will stay in the loop on this and ensure we have the support we need to process the PPAs within our FERC deadline...

Subject:	SLA Refund - heads up


There is a strong possibility that the FERC Order on NNG's SLA Settlement will become FINAL around March 3, 2002.
Then we will have 45 days to repath Nov-Feb Reservation & Commodity invoices for all Firm & Interruptible transport contracts, using the settled rates.  (The SLA Settlement reduces the rates that have been in effect since June, 2001, but it doesn't roll them back  to the RP98-302 rate case rates.)

The timing & process will be similar to what we did in August, 1999.

I would put the revised rates into TRS right after the February Commodity Invoices go out (around 3/12).
The rates will be effective back to 11/1/2001.  We will repath 4 months with several iterations to check discounts and adjust manuals.
Fuel is unaffected.  Storage contracts shouldn't be affected, either.

We will use the February Commodity PPA cycle for the Commodity part of the refund.
We will use the March Reservation PPA for the Reservation part of the refund.
We would probably mail the refund PPA invoices at the end of March, just before the March Reservation Invoices go out on April 1.
The refund dollars would hit the 3/2002 GL.

If we follow the same plan as 8/99, then commodity PPAs will be shut off after the current, 1/2002 commodity invoices.
Any non-SLA related PPAs would have to wait until the March Commodity invoice cycle in April.
If there are pending PPAs that need to be released in this invoice cycle, it would be a good idea to do so.

I'll resurrect the August, 1999 schedule and modify it later in the week.  Then, we can schedule a preliminary meeting to figure out what needs to happen.

If someone protests the SLA order in the next month, this schedule would be delayed, but we should probably start getting things in place.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

Q,

What are your plans for Chad next Saturday during the Shower?  Are you
taking him to play with Tom or do you want Grandpa to watch him.  Grandpa
wants to make plans, to either play with Chad or to go into work.  It does
not matter to him either way, but he would like to know.

Love Kim

Total West thruput for  2001   388,736,743

The average daily thruput is calculated as follows:  Total West for the year divided by 365.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Hello Everyone,

I made it to Singapore at 1:00 am on Sunday morning.  That should be 1:00 pm Saturday afternoon.  I had forgotten how long that flight is and there is no way I'd do it in coach/economy.  I'm currently in the Singapore Airlines Lounge, which has free internet access!  Imagine that, especially after our experience in Moscow.  I've taken a shower and changed clothes, but can not shave as my razor is in my checked luggage.  I have an 8:00 am flight for Jakarta.  Jakarta should be 13 hours ahead of Houston time.  I'll send an email Monday, from the office, advising you of my contact info.  You can send emails to me at my work email address.  I'll check them every morning at the office.

How did the shower go?  Did Alina turn on the charm?  Did she behave?

Well I need to go, but I miss the three of you already.

Love Kim

Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference

March 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia

 

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.

  _____  

Ancillary Services Conference

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment

May 14-17, 2002, Westminster, CO

 

OVERVIEW

 

Managing an electric distribution company, or any part of a distribution company, is a difficult endeavor in today's operating environment.  Customers and regulators demand reliable service.  Stockholders require more return from capital expenditures.  Training and retention of capable employees has become a major concern.   Selection of the investments and expenses that provide the most return is a continuous challenge.  With increasing constraints, and more-demanding performance expectations, distribution managers need new ideas and concepts to lead their companies.

 

"Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment" focuses on solutions to the issues that have made electric distribution such a challenging business.   It covers a full spectrum of topics, from distribution planning, load management services, reliability, customer relationship management, and management of aging assets.   Details from case studies are presented from utilities around the country.  Leaders in the distribution business present both novel and proven concepts, which participants can take home and apply in their business.  Coupled with a pre-conference workshop "Maximizing Performance Under Budget Constraints" and a post-conference workshop "Implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance to Reduce Costs", the conference gives valuable insights and the edge that participants need to be successful.

 

The brochure for Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment, May 14-17, 2002, Westin Hotel, Westminster, CO can be obtained by clicking here. <http://www.euci.com/pdf/dist_conf0502.pdf>

In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

"Alternating theory with
hands-on investigations of
applications works great."

"Course spurred many ideas,
very good discussions - liked
the small size of the session."

"I liked how you demonstrated
how the different instruments
related to generation, retail
load, etc."

"Excellent examples and
discussions of hedges."

"I thought that the examples
were on target to what
actually occurs."

Here's your list. I still need addresses. Would you mind terribly if I
invite Patsy? She really wants to meet Alina.

Thanks.  I will be so glad to be home.  I have a 102 degree fever today and
am counting the minutes til I board that plane.

The shower idea sounds fun.  I would prefer a girl shower if that's okay.
Clothes would be my preferred gift -- she wears a 4T or 5T.  She is very
short for her age, but nearly normal girth.  Medium at Gymboree fits her
fine.

The 19th won't work though, because it's my brother in law Troy's 40th
birthday in Austin.  So hopefully there is another day.


Potential List:
Cyndi
Rosemary
Christi
Michele Turkington
Andrea Flynn
Anita Kudla
Cindy Dick
Vicki Smith 
Karen Ferrazi
Gina Taylor
Debbie Thompson
Rosalia Nolan
Peggy Holmes
Lynn Blair
Donna Scott
Sheila Nacey

This list includes a few ladies that work for me -- last 4 names.   But,
otherwise I decided to skip too many work or church friends.  I think a
small gathering would be more fun.

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

Subject: Re: Draft Order No. 637 Filing



In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

the rate model should not be adjusted...the purchaser's tax situation does not automatically
apply to the rate entity acquired...it is on a case by case basis...i highly recommend that
the step up be maintained on a separate entity

I think the deferred taxes are gone for ratemaking purposes, too.  I'm checking with Patty to see how they are handling with MGT and whether we can identify some specific pipeline names from the IRS letter rulings that Dave Borcyk and Robert Guthrie have provided.   The elimination of the deferred tax liabilities ought to result in a larger rate base calculation, but resulting higher rates would certainly be subject to competitive forces.

Have to be careful that you don't lose historical data for rate purposes.

Tax gave us the same feedback. Davis had not yet updated the model for this.

Maybe I'm not looking at this appropriately, but why didn't the deferred taxes on the balance sheet disappear as of the date of sale to Dynegy?  My understanding is that the Option provided for a Section 338h10 basis step-up.  That would result in NNG's paying off its deferred taxes as of the transfer date.  I'm particularly interested in knowing how NNG will pay those taxes given that the note with Corporate can only be reduced to $240MM plus accrued dividends.  That tax election complicates the accounting significantly.

		I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

		1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven.
		2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers?
		3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative.
		4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
		5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

		Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

		Thanks,
		Kevin

This memo is on behalf of myself and Lynn Blair.   

The following is an update on the status of our effort to resolve/clear past due receivable items currently sitting in the a/r aging report. 

A/R-Imbalances, Transportation, Late Pay charges 
The attached report reflects all of the remaining A/R items over 30 days related to imbalance, transportation and late pay charges including any unapplied cash.  Gas Logistics has worked very diligently to ensure the A/R is up to date.  Where there were problems, they recruited the help of Marketing and were very successful in bringing closure to some A/R issues.  The items to be included in the write off package (totaling ($3,486.75)) are designated as such and summed separately on the attached report.  Gas Logistics has provided explanations/resolution plans in the right hand column of the report.  To summarize the report, there is exposure of $1,534,792.  Of that, $1,563,897 is made up of four customer issues (Hutchinson Utilities, IES Industries, MidAmerican Energy and Utilicorp-CCI bankruptcy).  There are currently reserves set up for MidAmerican, $221,429 and Utilicorp, $98.496.  

Beginning immediately Gas Logistics will include an aging report for all outstanding a/r as part of the customer accounts status package.  This package has been and will continue to be distributed to all  account managers monthly.

Gas Logistics has the initial responsibility to collect payments from shippers and will involve the account manager when an issue or collection problem occurs.  However the account manager will also have the responsibility to keep themselves informed as to the status of their shippers accounts.  The reports provided to them in the customer accounts status package will help them do so.

Work orders 
Outstanding work order receivables are being researched and reconciled by Tim Bayles in John Cobb's organization and they plan to resolve these balances independent of the transportation-related effort.  Currently it is our understanding there is approximately $1.2m of outstanding work order receivables with $.6 reserved in December, 2001.  Mike McGowan has offered Laura Lantefield's assistance with getting these resolved.   

OBA's 
OBA's were not originally included as part of our a/r focus however Gas Logistics is already putting the same effort into resolving/clearing any OBA issues.  Currently OBA's over $200,000 are included in the customer accounts status package.  Gas Logistics is preparing a report similar to the a/r report for OBA's under $200,000.  This report will indicate which OBA's are reconciled and which ones need a resolution plan.  

Please let Lynn or I know if you have any further questions.

Jayshree,

Shelley asked me to pass along representative revenue data for a NNG north-end power plant and a south-end power plant.  We chose the Great River Energy/Pleasant Valley #1 Power Plant in Minnesota and the West Texas Utilities/San Angelo Power Plant in Texas.  The total 2001 transportation revenues generated from these power plants are approximately $1,050,000 for Pleasant Valley #1 and $129,000 for San Angelo.  

I have attached two Microsoft Word excel spreadsheets to support the revenues generated from these two examples.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Rick

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

Due to the large number of moves recently, many locations and phones numbers are incorrect in Peoplefinder.  If your information is incorrect, our HR staff has sent the instructions below on how you can correct your data.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us.

Mail stop - this is how your paycheck (if your pay method is hard copy) and other mail comes to you.  Updates should be e-mailed by the employee or a department administrative assistant to Kenneth Mathews along with the person's P number.  Here is a link to a mail stop listing so that you can choose the correct mail stop:

	http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp?cabinet_id=127   Select number 10. Mail Stop Listing.

Room Location - this is the room number that shows up in directories such as Peoplefinder.  Updates should be done by the each employee by logging in to eHRonline and choosing "Work Contact Information", make the change and save.

Work Address (street address) - this information is located on eHRonline under "Work Contact Information" but cannot be updated by employees; this address does not effect where you get your mail (the mail stop does).  However, it is being updated through HR by the ISC; it will be sometime next week before the ISC loads this information into SAP due to some other delays; this will change the address in eHRonline from 333 Clay to 1400 Smith

Q,

I know this is early, but I wanted to tell you today so that you can go home
tonight and retrieve something that I left for you and the kids.  Open my
top drawer in my dresser in the closet and you'll find your little surprise.

Hopefully my little token will make up for me not being there on Valentines
Day.  I love you and I'm always thinking of my three Valentines.

Love Kim

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

This leading event-dealing with the underlying issues of congestion management, market design and the cost associated with transmission restructuring-will feature top-flight speakers covering such topics as:

the locational marginal price (LMP) model as a means for addressing congestion by market means, 
the unique problems that arise when "load pockets" exist amid an otherwise adequate system, 
the virtues of Standard Market Design, 
the realities of operating a system under LMP, and 
the use of "hybrid" congestion management models that attempt to reconcile more than one transmission congestion paradigm.

n employee allocation to Dynegy.  Please complete, as best you can, the org=

is meeting for discussion by the group (my recollection is that we were all=
 asked to come up with a list of the people we needed to run our groups ass=
uming NNG doesn't come back, along with a budget based on that headcount). =
 The people you don't use for your proposed organizations are the ones that=
 will go to Dynegy under this approach.   At this meeting, we will discuss =
our org. charts and try to come up with a consensus proposal that we'd ask =
Stan to sign off on and that we'd then propose to Dynegy.  I understand tha=
t there are some unresolved issues on how to do this (Phil's question about=
 how many officers his new group should have, for example) but we need to s=
ort it out as best we can and then run it by Stan.  DF

Unfortunately, with her being a non-employee she will need to get a temp badge everyday.  The other option would be to have her sign in as a visitor and have an escort.  I will let the Security Kiosk know that she will be coming that week and to issue a temp badge.
Thanks

Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Thanks for your help,

Raetta

Hi Shelley:
I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower.  It 
will be great to have the opportunity to visit with you.
Just so you know, Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help 
entertain Alina if needed.
There are several people that I have not heard from as far as RSVP's.  We 
will have plenty of food, so if anyone asks you, please tell them just to 
come!
Take care,
Barbara
P.S.  By the way, if you have any pictures or mementos from your trip that 
you might like to share, bring them along.

Terrell / Gina

As you may or may not be aware, The Dicks, Kudlas and Erbs are all going to
the Aeros game Friday night after practice.  The kids were given Aeros
tickets for good grades.  We also stumbled upon four additional tickets
(thru work) and were wondering if you and your family would like to use
them.  I have no idea where all the seats are located, but I'm sure we
could
probably all relocate around each other.  Let me know if you would like to
use the tickets.  If not, we can return them and somebody else can use
them.
