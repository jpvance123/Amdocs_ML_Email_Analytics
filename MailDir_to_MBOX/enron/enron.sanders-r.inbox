Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Danielle,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.

If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. 

I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

I trust all is well,

Doug Gilbert-Smith
Director, Ercot Trading

	As you know, we received a letter from Rocky Mountain Helium ("RMH")  threatening litigation in connection with Enron's investment in Crescendo.  We believe that if RMH files suit, it will be in Federal Court in Denver. 
	Do you guys have a firm that you have used in Colorado (preferably Denver) that you would like me to call about this case?  
	Thanks in advance.

If you go back to the 1970's HNG Oil Co. had production in Zapata County, which then became Enron Oil & Gas, which was owned by Enron Corp. Enron Corp itself paid no direct property taxes to either Zapata County or Zapata ISD. Enron Gas Marketing and Intratex had no hard assets in Zapata county but may have taken title to the gas somewhere down the pipeline. Houston Pipeline did have a large gathering and transportation network in Zapata County. I would assume that most the gas moved out of Zapata county to processing facilities in other counties.
I don't have a problem signing an affidavit stating that the three defendants had no reserves or stored gas in Zapata County.

Gavin

The owner of the gas in storage would pay the property taxes not the owner of the facility unless that language was in the storage agreement. HPL has paid the property taxes for numerous entities that have stored gas at Bammel. They basically add the cost of the liability to the storage fee.

	Thanks for taking time to explain how county ad valorem taxes in Texas work to both me and Becky.  As I understand it, there are two types of county ad valorem taxes that might be relevant in this lawsuit:  a tax on reserves in the ground pre-production, which is typically paid by the producer, and a tax on gas that has been produced and then stored in some sort of storage facility in that county (although I didn't ask, I again assume that the owner of the gas in the storage facility or the owner of the gas storage facility pays that tax).

	If I recall correctly, you advised me that none of the three Enron defendants named (Enron Corp., Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. and Intratex) had paid either of these two types of ad valorem taxes back as far as your records show.  I am hoping that you can say that based on your records, none of these entities owned any reserves in Zapata County or stored in gas in Zapata County or owned any storage facilities in Zapata County (whatever the relevant question is) for as far back as your records go (I recall you mentioning that none of these entities stored gas in Zapata County, but I can't remember if I asked you if I also asked you to confirm that none of these entities owned any gas reserves in Zapata and I don't know how far back your records go).

	(Of course, if I have gotten any of this wrong or mischaracterized what you've said, please let me know).

	If I haven't worn out my welcome, would you be the right person to be able to sign an affidavit supporting the foregoing?  I am anticipating that we will need to file an affidavit confirming these facts in the near future to support a motion to dismiss.

	I look forward to hearing from you.

	Britt

The timing has become critical as to finishing the due diligence necessary
for us to formulate with some certainty our defenses and prepare for the
meeting requested by Bid/Ask to discuss the issues.  The answer is due a
week from today, and we still have the plaintiff's request that we meet on
Wed or Thursday of this week to discuss the merits of the case. We must get
the technical detail that we requested some time ago, have an opportunity to
review same, and probably discuss it with the Enron tech folks so that we
can prepare properly for advising you and meeting with the other side.  How
can we get this accomplished?

Kevin Montagne is running the "code" reports.  I should have them sometime Tuesday.

I spoke will Bill and let him know we would have the "code" tomorrow.  

Kevin Montagne said his research indicates we do lock two records when there is an order.  I relayed that  info to Bill.

	I recently heard from David Marshall in the Risk Management Group that we may have made or were contemplating a claim against Ron Anderson of IBC Turbo for misrepresenting the quality of the gas turbines that he procured for us.  Marshall said that you were the person who would know.  

	Anderson is a potentially crucial witness for us if we decide to pursue Underwriters on the insurance claim arising out of the failure of the Doyle Unit #1, which is one of the gas turbines that he procured for us and that was located in Monroe, Georgia at the Doyle plant.

	Are you the man I need to talk to?  I know you are underwater.  Is there anyone else who would know about this?

	Britt

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

	Gavin,

	Thanks for taking time to explain how county ad valorem taxes in Texas work to both me and Becky.  As I understand it, there are two types of county ad valorem taxes that might be relevant in this lawsuit:  a tax on reserves in the ground pre-production, which is typically paid by the producer, and a tax on gas that has been produced and then stored in some sort of storage facility in that county (although I didn't ask, I again assume that the owner of the gas in the storage facility or the owner of the gas storage facility pays that tax).

	If I recall correctly, you advised me that none of the three Enron defendants named (Enron Corp., Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. and Intratex) had paid either of these two types of ad valorem taxes back as far as your records show.  I am hoping that you can say that based on your records, none of these entities owned any reserves in Zapata County or stored in gas in Zapata County or owned any storage facilities in Zapata County (whatever the relevant question is) for as far back as your records go (I recall you mentioning that none of these entities stored gas in Zapata County, but I can't remember if I asked you if I also asked you to confirm that none of these entities owned any gas reserves in Zapata and I don't know how far back your records go).

	(Of course, if I have gotten any of this wrong or mischaracterized what you've said, please let me know).

	If I haven't worn out my welcome, would you be the right person to be able to sign an affidavit supporting the foregoing?  I am anticipating that we will need to file an affidavit confirming these facts in the near future to support a motion to dismiss.

	I look forward to hearing from you.

	Britt

Hey guys!  I know you've been wondering what's going to happen to Team Enron for the 2002 MS150.  Going forward, Enron will not be able to fund the team, but I have some very good news for you!  Sun & Ski has adopted us so we can stay together, and all we have to do is change our name.  We will be Team Sun & Ski, with an official announcement of the name coming out a bit later, but since the deal was just finalized, I wanted you to be the first to know that we have a new arrangement while we are working out all the details.

We will have all the same amenities we have enjoyed over the years, and our new sponsor has asked me to stay on as Team Captain, which makes me very happy, as that saves me from a major identity crisis.  Don't know what I would do without you guys!  Just wanted you to know that I will still be your point of contact for all communications.  Please do not try to get info from the Sun & Ski stores, as their staff would not be prepared to answer any team questions this early in the planning stages.

We want to retain your participation, and plan to make our new team bigger and better than ever!

All the details will be forthcoming by e-mail as soon as we have anything to tell you about registration and all the other plans we have in store for you.  We have about 50 of you registered already for Team Enron, and we will automatically put you on Team Sun & Ski unless I hear otherwise.

Stay tuned, and have a Happy New Year!

To discuss this outline and our issues list, can people attend a 2pm Houston Time call.  The meet and confer may be on-going, but maybe either Jeff or Sue can jump off.

Linda Noske will be sending out a call-in number.

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

     Marianne,

     Many thanks. We'll take the ad valorem tax issue from here.

     Please continue your work on the other matters:

    1.  Have any of the Enron entities named gathered and/or been the first measurer of gas in Zapata County?

    2.  Has any Enron entity not named (primarily HPL) gathered and/or been the first measurer of gas in Zapata County? (This raises the question whether Intratex was operating its own pipe, or HPL pipe, etc., and I don't know the answer to that question).

    3.   Could we realistically determine from our records whether there are wells in adjacent counties that draw gas from communitized or unitized leases that might include a Zapata county lease and that we gathered from and/or were the first measurer of gas?

    As usual, I need all this info ASAP.
	
    Many thanks.

    Britt

Britt,
	Becky offered her assistance on this phase of the project.  I provided her with Jim Curry's, Ad Valorem Tax Manager,
telephone number.  Becky can provide you with details of her findings pertaining to ad valorem production taxes and ad valorem property taxes.   

	I continue to focus my efforts on obtaining contractual and accounting data from the historical databases (going back to at least 1980).  I am also researching the current Global Contracts and Unify Accounting Systems for the more recent years.  I will keep you posted on the results.

	Thanks again Becky!  

Marianne

	Marianne,

	ASAP, can you find out whether any of the Enron entities named in this suit have ever paid any taxes assessed by the County of Zapata or the Zapata County Independent School District?  The kind of taxes would be ad valorem taxes.  We have a whole tax department that deals with that stuff.  Besides the Enron defendants named in this suit, see if any Enron entity ever paid these taxes for Zapata County.

	Please keep me closely advised of your progress.

	Thanks.

	Britt

Subject:	Brazil Update

CUIABA
Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a "put" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  

GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.

Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.

ANNEX V

After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.

Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  

I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.

Regards,
   Michelle

Pete,

You weren't too late and John conveyed the message to Roy Reardon our mediator.  I talked with John and the phone call with Reardon turned out to be each side giving their story--King went first and took about 30 minutes which Gardiner happily listened to.  I'll let Gardiner give you the details tomorrow, but the upshot was as follows  (please sit down and resist punching the screen):

1.   Shell came into the deal at $494 with outside lending for 70% and only 30% equity.  From Nov. 2000--Mar.2001 there was a dramatic budget increase that caused Shell concern because the numbers didn't make sense.

2.  Enron owes Shell a fiduciary duty of full & frank disclosure, good faith, honesty.  

3.  The turnkey contract with SCC for a lump sum of $398  "gave Shell great comfort" because SCC had to complete the project timely or pay delay damages. 

4.  Shell was not consulted about the increase from $494 to $621. (!?)  (Go figure....)

5.  What angered shell the most, was the manner in which we tried to impose the $688 budget for their failure to object.  (While this could be true it is not a terribly sympathetic argument because the project companies needed money).

6.  Shell believes SCC should have to bear these costs.

7.  "Shell will prove that the A&R contract did not have Shell's consent." ????

8.  Even though Shell bought in, they were never treated properly as a partner in the project and were consistently excluded.  (Calm down Laine!)

9.  Now that gas is at the plant, the turbines are broken and we're not earning money.   The turbines broke because we used the wrong fuel, "somebody left tools in GT12," and we "released Siemens from their warranty."  (never mind that it expired...).

The more of these ridiculous arguments they make, the better for us, so Gardiner is going to encourage Shell to go first.  We'll discuss tomorrow.

Regards,
      Michelle

Subject:	Shell - hope I am not to late

I don't like using the financing just yet as a harm caused by Shell's actions.

Seems like the harm has been - Shell's refusal to follow the agreements - forced Enron to fund Shell's share in order to complete the project.  Enron wants to be compensated fairly for puttting more of its money at risk than it was required to.  The compensation of the additional contributions from Enron result from the note structure which adds additonal costs to the projects - which are already overrun - putting additional financial burdens on the operating companies which they can ill afford to bear.    Enron wants to be compensated directly by Shell and not through the project companies - alleiviating the burden on the companies.


A little late in the day for a new argument - but what do you think of it - 

Shell is seeking to resolve the issue now - as it believes the project is largely derisked from a construction stand point. 

Pete

i do recall this incident but not in much detail. i think there was also a =
counter claim from enron based on the fact the ship could not have loaded t=
he cargo (ie, it was not capable of cooling the cargo - misrepresented by e=
xmar) as well as a claim for some excess tug charges (don't recall what tha=
t was about). in the end, the amounts of the two claims offset or almost of=
fset thus our position of dropping the matter.

seemed to recall we had a pretty fair arguement in our position but not sur=
e where all the docs are now. this was in legal for some time in that i thi=
nk shawn hall or marty penkwitz started the counter. think steve lovelady w=

by copy, bob, would appreciate if you could check with jackie travis whethe=

P.S. to Dan:  given that Exmar's solicitors just got word that Exmar is not=

Dear Andrew:=20

Thanks for the information from Exmar.  Wayne Perry, our chief business con=
tact with Exmar, recently went on consultant status.  I will find out (Dan,=
 can you help?) who the relationship contact will be going forward and see =
if that person has any cause for optimism.=20

You confirmed that no hearing had been set in this very old maritime arbitr=
ation, which arises out of the loading in Houston, Texas almost ten years a=
go of the SANTA CLARA.  The ship had been chartered by ELFI from Exmar to l=
oad a cargo of propane.  Loading was delayed and less than the full contrac=
tually-committed amount of propane could be loaded.  We believe that this w=
as because the ship had to take so much time to cool off its tanks to compr=
ess the propane, even though the propane was delivered at the contractually=
-required temperature.  Exmar apparently takes the position that this was c=
aused by the lack of back pressure from the shore tanks.  In any case, Exma=
r reportedly billed ELFI about $165,000 in demurrage as a result. Part of t=
his was apparently deadfreight, a charge by the ship for ELFI not having av=
ailable all the product that the ship was supposed to load.  To add insult =
to injury, ELFI also paid off another ship that was in line to get the SANT=
A CLARA's berth, so that the SANTA CLARA could continue loading and sail wi=
thin its window of opportunity.  Based on the foregoing, I understand that =
ELFI has a counterclaim of about $150,000.

You advised that recoverable interest would probably increase the principal=
 of both claims by about 70%.=20

You advised that you would send me information regarding your firm's time i=
n this case to date.  You advised that you estimated ELFI spending an addit=
ional 25,000-30,000 pounds in this matter, assuming that the arbitration la=
sted two days, and that under the normal U.K. arbitration rules, the loser =
would be responsible for the arbitrators' fees and expenses and opposing co=
unsel's fees and expenses.  You did not agree with Exmar's proposal to try =
this matter solely on the documents, given the fact issues as to what cause=
d the delay in loading, although this would reduce trial costs.

As I mentioned, I am by copy of this e-mail asking Wietze Dingeldein, Enron=
's U.K. demurrage expert, to give you a call upon your return August 20 and=
 take a look at your file and give his comments as to the strength of the d=
emurrage claim (Wietze, I am thinking particularly about any time-bar argum=
ents, but any ammunition you can give us would be helpful).  Both you and W=
ietze may want to consider whether the condition of the ship invalidates th=
e NOR under the Glencore Grain v. Flacker Shipping (HAPPY DAY) decision.

I am also asking Paul Henking, who now works in ENA's Singapore office, if =
he was involved in fixing this ship and remembers anything about it.

I appreciate your help.=20

Dear Britt=20

"SANTA CLARA"=20

Thanks for your e-mail of 11th July and I apologise for the slow response.=
=20

As you know we have suggested to Exmar's lawyers, that in the light of the=
=20
underlying commercial relationship the parties should consider a=20
straightforward drop hands settlement.=20

We have recently finally heard from our opponents who say that whilst they=
=20
are keen to maintain a good commercial relationship with Enron "they=20
nevertheless do wish to obtain an award on this matter."=20

They have, however, suggested that in order to reduce costs, the parties=20
proceed with a documents only arbitration.=20

Whilst, Exmar's solicitors are correct in suggesting this would lead to a=
=20
significant saving in costs, I do not consider we should agree to this and=
=20
that we should have an oral hearing of about 2 days.  I say this because I=
=20
think there is a much better prospect of explaining to the arbitrators that=
=20
this is not a straightforward demurrage dispute, if we present our evidence=
=20
by way of Counsel's submissions and expert evidence.=20

I would, however, welcome your views on this.=20

I will be out of the office from close of business today until 20th August=
=20
and I have arranged to discuss this matter further with Exmar's solicitors=
=20
on my return.=20

Kind regards.=20

BellSouth is offering us a great rate to Latin America which we can use if we move quickly.  I propose using their contract to buy from them -- they do not want to review the Enron agreement, plus theirs looks pretty light and allows monthly billing.  (If we ever sell to them we will use our contract).  The only business issues I have with their agreement are: (1) Rate increase should be 7 days; (2) All access and recurring charges on Exhibit 1 should be set to $0.

Please call to discuss.

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Cyndi --

Per your request, I attach a list of those individuals who are currently exempt from the electronic mail retention policy.  As I mentioned to you last week, we will soon be eliminating the EBS folks from this list (that is, all EBS employees will be subject to the e-mail retention policy).  I will give you more details later this week on when to put the EBS employees back on the e-mail retention policy.
Thanks.

	After meeting with Jesus Melendrez this morning, meeting with the Crescendo folks for a few minutes this afternoon (they were in the office in connection with other matters) and talking with the Crescendo lawyer on the phone, I called Chris Sullivan to let him know that his letter to Jim Derrick had been referred to me for handling. I started my conversation with Mr. Sullivan by telling him that I had no substantive knowledge about this matter and that I had talked with the Crescendo folks briefly about his letter and expected that they would respond to the substantive points he raised "sooner rather than later".
	Mr. Sullivan was not thrilled with this response indicating that he already knew what Crescendo had to say on the subject. In fact, this was an interesting comment since, at other times during our call, he mentioned that he had been waiting for a reply from Crescendo for months. He then went on for some time about how he had been talking to Crescendo and others about his helium rights for up to 2 years (his time estimates changed as he continued to talk) and that he believed the project was scheduled to go on line in early November and still had not received a satisfactory response from Crescendo. He also mentioned a call to Keith Pruitt at Enron in February and that he hadn't heard back from him either.  It sounded to me like Mr. Sullivan wanted Enron to support his position and intervene on his behalf against Crescendo based only on his letter. 
	 In any event, Mr. Sullivan again threatened to involve the government and go forward with litigation to prevent helium from being wasted.  I reiterated that I could not discuss his substantive concerns, that I was not yet up to speed on this matter and that we would look into it.
	I received from Jesus copies of the correspondence between Crescendo and Mr. Sullivan as well as a legal opinion on Crescendo's obligations, if any, to Mr. Sullivan.  Also included in the information I received were copies of the letters exchanged between Crescendo and the BLM on this matter. I am in the process of reviewing these and expect to talk to Crescendo's attorney this weekend.  In the meantime, he is working on a response to the substantive points raised in Sullivan's letter.
	Please call with any questions or comments.

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

CUIABA
Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a "put" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  

GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.

Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.

ANNEX V

After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.

Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  

I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.

Regards,
   Michelle

Richard:  Robert Knight said that you might be able to provide me some guidance regarding the legal issues involved in the recording of conversations.  A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?  Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated.  Thanks for your time.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Subject:	RE: RSM Production v. El Paso

If you go back to the 1970's HNG Oil Co. had production in Zapata County, which then became Enron Oil & Gas, which was owned by Enron Corp. Enron Corp itself paid no direct property taxes to either Zapata County or Zapata ISD. Enron Gas Marketing and Intratex had no hard assets in Zapata county but may have taken title to the gas somewhere down the pipeline. Houston Pipeline did have a large gathering and transportation network in Zapata County. I would assume that most the gas moved out of Zapata county to processing facilities in other counties.
I don't have a problem signing an affidavit stating that the three defendants had no reserves or stored gas in Zapata County.

Gavin

The owner of the gas in storage would pay the property taxes not the owner of the facility unless that language was in the storage agreement. HPL has paid the property taxes for numerous entities that have stored gas at Bammel. They basically add the cost of the liability to the storage fee.

Importance:	High


	Gavin,

	Thanks for taking time to explain how county ad valorem taxes in Texas work to both me and Becky.  As I understand it, there are two types of county ad valorem taxes that might be relevant in this lawsuit:  a tax on reserves in the ground pre-production, which is typically paid by the producer, and a tax on gas that has been produced and then stored in some sort of storage facility in that county (although I didn't ask, I again assume that the owner of the gas in the storage facility or the owner of the gas storage facility pays that tax).

	If I recall correctly, you advised me that none of the three Enron defendants named (Enron Corp., Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. and Intratex) had paid either of these two types of ad valorem taxes back as far as your records show.  I am hoping that you can say that based on your records, none of these entities owned any reserves in Zapata County or stored in gas in Zapata County or owned any storage facilities in Zapata County (whatever the relevant question is) for as far back as your records go (I recall you mentioning that none of these entities stored gas in Zapata County, but I can't remember if I asked you if I also asked you to confirm that none of these entities owned any gas reserves in Zapata and I don't know how far back your records go).

	(Of course, if I have gotten any of this wrong or mischaracterized what you've said, please let me know).

	If I haven't worn out my welcome, would you be the right person to be able to sign an affidavit supporting the foregoing?  I am anticipating that we will need to file an affidavit confirming these facts in the near future to support a motion to dismiss.

	I look forward to hearing from you.

	Britt

=09I have not heard back from Lazaro as to our request for an extension of =
time.  I left a call for him today, asking him to call me back tomorrow mor=
ning.

=09I have received a copy of the Court's file from Lazaro by letter dated O=
ctober 26.  It is thin, but indicates that this suit clearly fit within the=
 framework of a larger strategy by Grynberg involving Quinque.  Keep in min=
d that what we have been served is a first supplemental petition:

=091.  There is an original petition that was filed July 15, 1999, which pu=
rports to be a class action suit on behalf of Zapata County and all other s=
imilarly situated counties and parishes in the United States of America for=
 deliquent ad valorem taxes and other damages.  Although I have not compare=
d the original petition in Zapata County with the petition in Quinque, both=
 the list of defendants and allegations of mismeasurement appear to be the =
same.  The plaintiff's attorneys seem to be the same.  Although I have not =
compared the original Zapata petition with the first supplemental Zapata pe=
tition, I see no mention of RSM Production or the Zapata County Independent=
 School District in the original petition, although both appear in the firs=
t supplemental petition.  There is no class action allegation in the supple=
mental petition (although it does mention gas produced in Zapata county and=
, cryptically, in other counties).  I have never seen a "supplemental" plea=
ding that dropped class action allegations and defendants, and added plaint=
iffs.  The first supplemental petition is more correctly titled an amended =
petition.  Perhaps the plaintiff's attorney had a reason for not calling at=
tention to the radical change in the nature of a lawsuit.

=092.  On March 21, 2000, the Court issued an order on plaintiff's verified=
 motion to retain case.  The order was based on a motion by plaintiff for i=
tself and all other similarly situated counties, alleging that the same gro=
up of defendants had been sued in Quinque and removed the case.  "Judicial =
economy will result in the present action by waiting for a ruling in the Ka=
nsas litigation, thus avoiding the same procedural motions in this case."  =
Plaintiff moved for and was granted abatement of the case for 6 months unti=
l September 21, 2000 or until 30 days after a ruling on the motion for rema=
nd in the Kansas litigation, whichever comes first. =20
 =20
=093.  On March 12, 2001 (almost a year later than item #2), one of plainti=
ff's counsel, the law firm of Farnsworth and Von Berg, L.L.P., here in Hous=
ton, moved to withdraw as counsel for non-payment of fees by Jack Grynberg.=
  The motion notes as follows:  "In November 1999, following filing of this=
 lawsuit, Movants and Jack Grynberg and RSM Corporation, as representative =
of Zapata County Independent School District, severed their attorney/client=
 relationship because Jack Grynberg failed to pay attorney fees as per thei=
r contractual agreement."  There is nothing in the file reflecting even a p=
roposed order, much less a hearing on the motion.

=094.  The Court's docket sheet indicates that on August 30, 2001, the case=
 was called again by the Court and "reset for 9-27-01" (I am assuming that =
this is for another DWOP docket).

=095.  On September 25, plaintiffs filed their first supplemental petition =
by fax.

=096.  On September 27, the case was called before Judge Robert R. Eschenbu=
rg, and Jose A. Lopez (one of the plaintiff's attorneys) attended, and a sc=
heduling order was to be filed.

=097.  On October 1, about 20 citations were issued on various defendants.

=098.  On October 19, a letter to Jose Lopez from Margaret Timmons was file=
d.  The file sent to me does not contain a copy.

=099.  On October 22, the Court's docket literally shows that citation was =
served on Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., "Not executed."  I think that means th=
at the return of service on Enron Gas Marketing Inc. was filed.

=09I will make copies and have them distributed.

=09Britt

 Diane, any luck in getting the Enron Online Software code sections that we
requested from from Kevin Montague on Monday?

Richard, we will likely not be in a position to meet with the other side
next Wednesday without a chance to both acquire and digest this information.

Anther interesting observation about the Enron trading operation is this:
the Enron entity that is the operator of the software (Enron Online) is not
the same entity that purchases and sells goods, such as Enron North America,
and many other Enron companies.  Our people characterize the operation of
the system as if "Enron" is operating the system, and the only buyer and
seller on the Enron side, making the system a "one to many" trading
scenario, thereby distinguishing it from the "many to many" scenario of the
patent in suit.  If you view the different Enron entities as separate, then
the operation of Enron Online is more like an exchange in making a trade
between two different  parties.  Although we will argue this is form over
substance, the nature of the legal entities making the transaction will
likely be argued by the Plaintiff to be more like a "many to many" type
system, and therefore within the scope of the patent.

Mike/Sarah,

California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632 make it a misdemeanor to record a telephone conversation without the consent of all the parties.  In addition, civil penalties are available in the amount of $5,000 per violation.  This is true whether the caller is in California or some other state.  If either party is in some other state, however, you may want to also check the law of that state.

If you are planning on taping a conversation, you should get unambiguous consent from all parties on the call before you begin taping.  Once you begin taping, you should again say words to the effect of, "the parties have consented and awknowledge that this conversation is being recorded" so that you have a record of the consent.  There does not appear to be any requirement of a periodic beep or tone (but it probably doesn't hurt so that the parties don't claim they didn't know that portion of the call was being recorded).

Monitoring and/or eavesdropping also is not acceptable in California without the consent of all parties to the call.  Similar disclosures would need to be made in that regard.

We have numerous former prosecutors in the office with experience with the statute so let me know if we can help with anything specific.

Regards,
Kristen

What is the law regarding the taping of telephone conversations in California in
the following instances:

--  both the caller (taping party) and recipient are located in California and

--  the caller (taping party) is not in California but the recipient is located
in California.

Must a statement be made that the call is being taped?  If so, are there any
magic words?

Should there be a beep or tone periodically during the conversation?

Any other requirements?

We would appreciate a response as soon as possible, preferably early Friday.

Since I will be out of the office on Friday, please include Mike D. Smith in
your response so that he can relay it to our business people.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Regards,

there is, in effect, no monthly update to speak of.  we have heard no word whether the other parties have finalized their settlement in priniciple, but note that  there have been no filings with the court.  there also have been no communications from the court, either about a case conference or a rescheduled date for the motion hearing.  we don't see any reason to push the court, so we'll let you know more when we know more.  call or e-mail with any concerns or questions.

	I have excellent seats (Section 122--4th row center court) for
the Tuesday, March 5 game (7:30) against Toronto.  It will be worth
seeing Vince Carter and Hakeem from those seats even if the Rockets are
25 games out of first place by then.  Let me know if you have any
interest in joining me.

Bob

Per your request I have reviewed the confidentiality provisions  in the contracts of the counterparties that have either objected to production or have not responded.  Some, but not all, provide that the party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware that may result in disclosure but they do not state that the details of the precise proceeding be provided.  Also, some provide that the Agreement is to remain confidential while others provide that the Transaction Schedule is to remain confidential.  As there are numerous variations, I have done memos that quote the confidentiality provision and then list the counterparties with that specific provision along with the specific objection or a list of the non-respondents.

.  Only 3 counterparties that given an unqualified objection, the remainder condition their approval on having certain info redacted, having contract produced under a cover and/or the entry of a protective order.  One party requests a phone conversation with Legal and another, Dimension One Spas, appears to have asked Jim Wright for his recommendation.

I'll have the summaries hand delivered this afternoon.  I've also, pulled all the contracts and attached them to a copy of the relevant memo.  Thus, the one file you sent up to me has expanded to four files.  I have them in a box; do I send them down to your office or elsewhere.

If you have any questions or if I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Rita

I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5.  Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge "adopted in D. 01-03-082."  Was the .01 surcharge "adopted" in that proceeding?  Maybe I am reading this too literally.  I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling).  Sue, I am forwarding this to you for your comments.

Importance:	High


	Ron,

	This follows-up on our voice-mails about the extension of time to file suit against Underwriters, which expires on Monday, December 10, and that FM Global will apparently not be sending us the $1,375,000 until Friday, December 14 (I hope I have that right).  

	We have a deal with FM Global to which it has agreed to by e-mail and which it has told us it would fund and has taken actions indicating that it would fund (i.e., calling Walton for permission to send the check to us, which Walton reportedly gave).  It has also explained that b/c of delays allegedly beyond its control, it could not make payment when originally expected, but will be doing so.  

	Accordingly, in what I think is the very highly unlikely circumstance that FM for some reason does not fund the settlement, I think we should sue on the settlement deal, rather than say that because of the breach, we want to go back to the original claim.  I think the latter approach would be problematic, given the present financial circumstances.

	Under the circumstances, I think it would be ridiculous for FM to try to take the position that because it had not funded a settlement to which it had agreed before the expiration of the suit-filing deadline, the insureds would be time-barred from pursuing FM.  I believe there is Texas caselaw that indicates that where an insured does not file suit because it is relying on the representations that the insured's claim would be settled, the insured is not time-barred from filing suit.

	On Monday, in an abundance of caution, I would send something to Claude along these lines by e-mail, with a return receipt requested:

	"Dear Claude:

	As you are aware, today is the deadline for filing suit against FM under the current extension of time.  However, as we have compromised that claim with FM as set forth in the letter of [whenever we sent out the letter that the ENA officer signed] and as you have represented to us that FM will be forwarding the settlement funds of $1,375,000 by Friday, December 14[or whatever the date is], we will not be filing suit against FM.

	Ron Tapscott"

	The other option is to ask for an extension of time to file suit on the settlement, but again, I don't think we need to do that.

	I will be in first thing Monday morning if you want to discuss further.  If anyone has a concern about this, please let me know immediately. 

	Britt

Richard - Per your request of Friday 10/19, this is the list of San Francisco users in question. You mentioned there are probably only 4 or so users that actually need to be exemptions to the Email retention policy. Do we need to do any kind of special communication the 4 or so users or the remaining SF users that are not exempt?

Thanks-
Cyndi

=09This will update you on the matters discussed during the joint defense c=
onference call held this afternoon:

=091.  One defendant group has approached the plaintiff's lead attorney reg=
arding a non-suit prior to the December 5 deadline for moving, answering or=
 otherwise pleading, but has heard nothing.  Others intend to do so before =
December 5 as well.  I am trying to quickly wrap up my due diligence on Int=
ratex, and once that is done, plan to approach the plaintiffs for a non-sui=
t of at least Enron Corp. and, depending on the results of the due diligenc=
e, on Intratex as well.  EGM has still not been served to our knowledge.

=092.  After discussion, counsel for the defendant holding companies have a=
greed to file on December 5 bare-bones motions to transfer venue to Harris =
County, with the intention of waiving them if plaintiffs appear disposed to=
 push back on them.  This is because of the problem I mentioned in my earli=
er e-mail today with a venue challenge opening the defendants up to discove=
ry on the merits of the "in concert" allegations.  I will be drafting a pro=
posed motion to transfer venue for at least Enron Corp., and will circulate=
 it among the defendants for them to use as a guide.  I may also draft a mo=
tion to sever (one is arguably necessary for a motion to transfer venue to =
be effective in a case like this), although it too would be bare-bones.  On=
e of the three required grounds for a motion to sever is that the severed a=
nd the remaining causes must not be so intertwined as to involve the same f=
acts and issues.  Accordingly, I see pursuing a motion to sever on behalf o=
f Enron Corp. to be highly problematic as well.   =20

=093.   All agreed to join in a motion to require Grynberg to show authorit=
y.  I have previously e-mailed you a draft prepared by F&J.  We see no down=
side to filing it and considerable upside, such as using it at least to blo=
ck discovery by Grynberg until it is resolved.  Please let me know if I hav=
e your authority to sign the motion.  It will be filed no earlier than Dece=
mber 6, and expressly subject to earlier-filed motions to transfer venue.

=094.  I will be working on a plea to the jurisdiction, answer, and affirma=
tive defenses to file on behalf of Enron Corp and Intratex, subject to any =
motion to transfer venue, and will circulate them to you for your review an=
d approval.  During the conference call, I raised the issue of adding a spe=
cial exception to the effect that the petition fails to state a claim, whic=
h is the proper procedural vehicle for what is essentially a Rule 12(b)(6) =
motion under the Texas Rules.  One attorney expressed concern that filing a=
 special exception could be viewed as somehow prejudicing a motion to trans=
fer venue.  As you can clearly raise a special exception later, we decided =
not to include a special exception in the pleadings we were filing on Decem=
ber 5.  We can always file it later.

=095.   On Friday, November 30, at 1:30 p.m ., there will be another joint =
defense conference call.  The discussion will be centered around whether La=
zaro was able to find any retainer agreement between the Zapata County Inde=
pendent School District and RSM (we only have a contract between Zapata Cou=
nty and RSM).  If Lazaro is unable to find a properly-filed contract, that =
may in itself be a breach of the Texas Open Meetings Act, and an additional=
 ground for our motion to challenge authority.

=09I will keep you advised.

=09Britt

Hey, I was screwing around on MLB.com.  The 2002 tentative schedule is out
for Toronto.  It looks as if the only weekend series with the redsox is the
11, 12,13,14 of July.

Richard,

Thanks for meeting with Paul and I yesterday.  As we discussed, I e-mailed
an initial request on 11/8 to Jenny Rub and Cris Sherman.  This previous
request (with some additions) is as follows:

     1.   Latest e-mail boxes and network file folders available for:
             Andrew Fastow
             Lea Fastow
             Ben Glisan
             Kristina Mordaunt
             Rick Buy
             Jeremy Blachman
             Anne Yeager
             Michael Kopper
             Kathy Lynn
             Chris Loehr
             Jeff Skilling
             Sherron Smith Watkins
             Joyce Tang (if an employee)
             Ace Roman (if an employee)

      2.   A list of all the laptop and desktop computers that have been
   secured by the company

      3.   A list of the dates that an e-mail backup tape has been retained
   for both lotus notes and outlook (Jenny         Rub mentioned that she
   has one backup at year end 2000 but there are others)

      4.   Access to Enron IT professionals in order to formulate
   procedures for identifying other network folders          of interest
   that would not be under an employees name (e.g., Ryan Siurek mentioned
   that Anne              Yeager may have maintained an LJM folder).

      5.   Access to the office contents of Ben Glisan and Kristina
   Mordaunt

      6.   A protocol for easy access to the office contents of Andrew
   Fastow, Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt.

      7.   A list of the documents that are being withheld for privilege
   purposes, or alternatively, redacted copies.

   We will also make additional requests shortly.  I will follow up with
   you later today.   Thanks for your help.

   Regards,

   Rick

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Following up on the earlier email I sent, it may make sense to delegate a
lot of the information gather than we will need for conflicts/disclosure
requirements (in the event of contingency planning) to Lisa Mellencamp. She
is so familiar with the informational needs that it will take some of the
load off of you.

If you think that makes sense, let me know -- or better yet, you can ask
Lisa to call Sylvia Baker at 713-546-5087, who has been charged with the
responsibility of getting this information together and into our system.

Thanks and I hope you get some sleep tonight.

Have been trying to run down Gordon White for several days regarding a
meeting. Finally talked to him today. He is out of town in North Carolina
the rest of this week and leaves for Sweden for almost two weeks this
weekend. THe earliest date we could set a meeting that accomodates his
schedule is Wednesday Dec 19th at Gordon's offices in Austin. I wanted to do
it earlier but Gordon is essentially out of pocket for almost three weeks.
Does this date work for you?
