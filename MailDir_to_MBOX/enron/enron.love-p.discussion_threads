Per your request, attached is the hedge strip file that we use to calculate 
your bench every night.  On one of the tabs R2, you will find your positions 
and a conversion factor.  I have tied these to the benchmark groups 
conversion factor numbers.  Let me know if we need some of these points 
changed, i.e. CGPR-DAWN's conversion factor is 0.  Shout with any questions.  
Thanks.

FYI - 
I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and 
booked to GD - Central.  This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to 
the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were 
incurred related to this orig.  Per Misti, this amount will come through in 
November and needs to be reclassed to July August adn September.  Cathy has 
the correct amounts on her back pages.  Please shout with any questions.

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

Hello!

As we enter the new year, I think we should all be reminded of Enron's work 
hour policies and the environment in which we operate.

Enron supports and encourages flexible work hours (7:30-4:30, 8:00-5:00, 
8:30-5:30, part-time, etc.).  Additionally, the policies allow us generous 
personal time, family time, sick leave, vacation time, etc.  We are supported 
and encouraged to put our health and families first. 

This culture allow us many freedoms, and it does not dictate a 
"clock-watcher" mentality.  However, we are all paid to give Enron a minimum 
of a 40 hour work week (or some other agreed upon part-time amount).  This 40 
hours does not include your lunch hour.  

As you are all aware, many of our fellow co-workers on the 30th floor are 
required to give much more than 40 hours a week.  Please do not abuse the 
privileges we are afforded, and do not tarnish the reputation of our group.

Thanks for all of your hard work and cooperation. . .
Carrie

That is what I had for your address, just checking.  We had a blast with
your uncles as well.  We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.  I
guess we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at
the wedding.  I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.
I guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  Since I have a
small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have
special friends that you consider family.   Plus, you know how special you
have always been and will be to me.

Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.  Sad to hear you are
working my kind of hours now.  Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but
counting the days till my rotation to a new group.

Talk to you soon.

We will take the MTM variance for 0010 - 441K - this is partially offset by 
Central's variance.  This is related due to the changing fo the transport

Good afternoon Phillip.  My name is Scott Schaunaman.
We spoke yesterday regarding engineering opportunities
at Enron.  I am currently seeking a position as a
junior-project engineer.

My background is in gas pipeline simulation and design
as well as miscellaneous project management for
pipeline terminals.  I currently work at Fluor Daniel
in Pipeline Engineering.  I am seeking a position with
an operating company as a junior-project engineer with
responsibilities in project cost, scheduling,
engineering, safety, environmental, and construction
supervision for pipeline projects. If you are aware of
any such opportunity, I would be interested in
pursuing a career with Enron.  Please see the attached
resume for more details regarding my qualifications.
If you have any questions or require additional
information, please feel free to contact me via e-mail
(saschaunaman@yahoo.com), or at 281-263-5667. Thanks
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to
hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Scott Schaunaman

P.S. Great game last night.  I was getting concerned
about losing our first game on our new turf.  The last
2 innings were great.  Have a good one.

After meeting with Larry Joe Hunter, we will not be granting tagg access to 
his group.  They were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the 
wrong counterparty.  The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do 
these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.  This is not an option.

Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.  We 
must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty 
initially.  Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line. If we do not have 
all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving 
enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.  FYI, this is going to be a 
highly visible area for us to make mistakes.  If we continue to make these 
mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.  To help us do this 
correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list 
on a monthlly basis.  We will still have emails sent denoting CP name 
changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future 
reference.  If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, 
please call Bianca Ornelas at  5-3782.

If you have any questions, please give me a shout.  Thanks.

Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system

Attached is the file with the appropriate liquidations that should match the 
transport expense variance.  We are within a few thousands dollars of the 
variance using these calculated liquidation amounts.  They are all physical 
annuities in the FT-Ont-Central book.  I am getting the post ids unarchived 
to verify that they were in the flash financial liquidations.  Please tell me 
if you have these in the FT file, I have already checked Jim's intra physical 
and financial files for Ontario and came up empty.  My thinking(hoping) on 
this issue is that  the liquidations will be flashed and not captured in the 
GL.  Give me a shout with any questions.

I wanted to ask a favor.  Would you mind reminding your group to please let 
us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal 
in sitara.  If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the 
deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically 
update when you change the physical deal.  If the change is simply a meter, 
that will not effect the pricing of the deal.  Thanks for your help.

We have made some slight changes to the orig schedule and may make a few more 
per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.  It is 
vitally important that we do two things with this file now.  We must fill in 
all columns on the first tab - orig schedule and we must put all orig deals 
in the schedule - even if no orig is granted.  THis policy is in effect 
starting today.  Shout with any questions.

Phillip and Kam

I put together spreadsheets summarizing the variances for Enron Canada 
purchases and sales for the Ontario region for August and it looks like we 
have a similar situation to July in that there are two liquidations on the 
purchase side that don't reference any particular Sitara deal that are 
directly offset in the liquidations for Transcanada Pipeline sales.  If we 
net these two liquidations, it significantly reduces both variances.  The 
Taggs are N63076.8 and 2 and N63076.C and 6.  



Thanks,
Cathy

Subject: Trader Web-site Information

Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

Shirley McDowell
Project Manager/Trader Web-site

Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas 
cards.

How is married life treating you?  Good I hope.  What are you guys doing for 
Christmas?  Are your folks coming in?

We are staying in Houston.  Should be nice and quiet.  We are going to have a 
few people over for new year's, but nothing special.

> "We failed to realize the steps that Mr. Lowder will go to to not allow

Jim

In addition to the problem with Central June that I emailed you a follow-up 
note just a few minutes ago, we also need help resolving the following:

In October, there is a variance for NY6237.1  for $200,880.00 between the 
NG-Price and the Intra-Central books.  Per Phillip, there should be an offset 
for this and there shouldn't be a variance.

In September there are the following variances that we need help identifying:
Oil-NG-H         $150,239.97
Exotic-T             324,397.00

In August, there is a variance for EW4539.2 for $(744,999.95).  Per Phillip, 
this should be offset with leg 3 and there should not be a variance.

Jeff Gossett is adamant about getting the financial liquidation variances 
cleared before next month and we really need your help resolving these.

Thanks,
Cathy

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Subject: Schedule

All,

John Valdes asked us to prepare a list of the items that we need/would like 
to see and when they are needed.  We have been putting together a timetable 
of Gas/Portfolio Accounting data as well and it is included at the bottom of 
this email.  Keep in mind that the timetable for what we would like to see 
and our data is based on all handoffs happening smoothly (ie if the desks 
don't flash until the 3rd workday we know we will not get WACOGS until that 
point).

Here are the items we have come up with to this point as being needed from 
the OA Group:



We would also like to be included in the Regional OA meetings to help resolve 
some matters up front rather than from a schedule.

Here is a timetable for our data:



Additionally, all buyer reallcation entries should be received within 24 
hours after expense hits the GL.


Starting in January 2001 the 1999 OA packages were not produced.  The data is 
still available for research and is included in the matrix detail report from 
SAP.   To keep the number of OA packages to a manageable level we are 
proposing to drop a quarter at a time after we reach 18 months of data.  We 
will drop these on a non-quarter end.  For example, in July 2001 accounting 
we will stop producing the OA's for the first quarter of 2000.  By this point 
PMA's should be minimal and OA variances should be minimal.

Remember that the dates above are a guideline that we are shooting for and 
can change if the handoff of information is not timely.  Each group is 
working to clear the roadblocks they face to make this process work.  The key 
to the process is communication and fixing any problems at their root cause.  
Also keep in mind these deadlines are based on the current 6 workday close 
process.  If close is accelerated, the above will have to be reworked.  
Please feel free to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

       Greg x35399

The Paul Harvey Philosophy

These things I wish  for each of you.....
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that  we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like  for them to know 
about hand-me
down clothes and homemade ice cream and  leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I 
really would. I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you 
learn honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn  to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I 
really
hope nobody  gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.

It will be good if at  least one time you can see puppies born and your old 
dog put to
sleep. I hope  you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.

I hope you  have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all 
right if  you
have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to  crawl 
under the
covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When  you want to 
see a movie
and your little sister wants to tag along, I hope  you'll let her.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your  friends and that you live 
in a
town where you can do it safely. On rainy days  when you have to catch a 
ride, I hope
you don't ask your 'driver' to drop you  two blocks away so you won't be seen 
riding
with someone as uncool as your  Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad
teaches you how to make one  instead of buying one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read  books. When you learn to use 
computers,
I hope you also learn to add and  subtract in your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you  have your first crush on a 
girl, and
when you talk back to your mother that  you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a  mountain, burn your hand on a stove and 
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a beer once, 
but I hope you don't like it. And if a  friend offers you dope or a joint, I 
hope you realize he is not your  friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma and  go fishing 
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.

I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a  baseball through a 
neighbor's
window and that she hugs you and kisses you at  Christmas time when you give 
her a mold of your hand.

These things I wish  for you: tough times and disappointment, hard work and 
happiness.
To me, it's  the only way to appreciate life.

Send this to all of your friends that  mean the most to you but, don't send 
it back to
whoever sent it to you. They  have already read it and you don't need to show 
them that you are a good friend.  They already know!

"We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by  doing them."

Paul Harvey - "Good Day"!

FYI - 
wanted to let you guys know about a few things:
1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there 
quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this 
opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for 
career development.
6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your 
training plans.

Please shout with any questions.

I apologize for not including the following curve in the original list:

It looks like all the other ones are done, is that correct?

FYI - those of you running firm books.  These adjustments described below are 
due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.  In the future, we 
need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E.  Schedule C should be 
used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other 
adjustments.  Shout with any questions.

Jeff,

I need your help with a few items.  In the DPR rolls for several books this 
month there were topside adjustments inserted.  It was my understanding that 
all topsides would be included on the associated roll schedules (Sch E and 
Sch C).  Investigating all of these is greatly increasing our reconciliation 
time.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Here are a few 
books that had topsides:

MTM Topsides that should have been on Schedule C
GD-Central
FT-Texas
FT-Central
Liquidation topsides that should have been on Schedule E
GD-Central
FT-Northwest
FT-Ontario

Let me know if you need more information or if there is anything we can do to 
help.  Thanks.

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...

2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not

3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any

4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>

Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti

Subject: RE:  Your NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <peretti@media.mit.edu>

Subject: RE: Your  NIKE iD order o16468000 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed in 
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own 
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will 
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we 
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so that 
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even 
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie

PGL and North Shore converted part of their index supply deal into a nymex 
fix price (basis is still floating).  Please amend the existing supply deal 
to reflect this change and confirm the supply contract ammendment as we 
discussed.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
Phillip

I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This 
relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics 
yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.  
This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous 
deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears 
you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are 
E00982.4 &.5.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain 
in the butt.

Subject: 2000 Individual goals

Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed in 
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own 
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will 
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we 
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so that 
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even 
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=

basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=

Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=

regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=

Here is the file.  We used Victor's transport model that he uses for all of 
the other transport deals.  The omicron volatility curve that we used was 11 
- the same as other Chigate deals.  Give me a shout with any questions.

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Patrick Marchand, 5-5636.

We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in 
sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated 
properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.  Would 
you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the 
other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines 
on other desks.  For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one 
sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.  This would simply be an 
additional step to verify all deals are being captured.  Hopefully this will 
eliminate any future problems.  If you have any suggestions for ways to 
better handle this, please let me know.  Thanks.

What's up in the hood?  It sounds like you guys live in Compton instead of 
San Diego?  Make sure Emma starts packing when she starts kindergarten.  If 
she is strapped, she can shoot back at these SOBs.  Yet another reason Texas 
is better than Cali - we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because 
they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass.  

Do you guys want me to order you Jazz Fest tickets when I order ours?  I am 
putting in an order for alot of people because if I mail order them it only 
costs $3 total as opposed to ticket master's $3 fee per ticket.  Since I am 
ordering ours this way, I can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket 
price(I eat the $3 because I am doing ours this way anyway).  The tickets are 
$15 through the mail per day as opposed to $20 at the gate and $18 through 
ticketmaster.  Let me know.  I am ordering all three days for ashley and I 
hoping we go all three days.

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.

Subject: duplicate deals

Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating 
duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate 
books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight 
deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the 
problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this 
afternoon.  

Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate 
deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.  
Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late 
last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward 
this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the 
Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it.

I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this 
may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Thanks,
Dawn

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.


"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

Jeff-

How is it going ?  My friend, Brett Turner, just graduated from LSU with a 
Masters in Finance.  He has a job offer from Credit Suisse First Boston in 
their London office, but would like to investigate opportunities in Houston.  
I reviewed his resume and it looks like he could be a good fit for Risk 
Management.  Brett is a sharp guy who is extremely motivated.  Could you 
please review his resume (attached) and let me know what you think.  

Try not to hold it against him that he is an LSU Tiger and a friend of mine.

Thanks,

CKL

 Terry Mills , F IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Mills was placed on the injured list by the Pacers on Wednesday with a=20

points and eight rebounds. Don't expect any type of Fantasy production from=

Scott this season.  =20

 Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Cato joined the team in San Francisco and will practice Wednesday.  He is=
=20
not expected to be activated for Thursday's game with the Warriors but expe=
ct=20
him to return befor next week.  Cato is a good rebounder  and shot blocker=
=20
but he doesn't play enough to have value in smaller Fantasy leagues.     =
=20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Richardson missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is=
=20
listed as day-to-day. Richardson has played well since Tyrone Nesby was=20
traded to Washington, but his Fantasy value is still very questionable. Kee=

track of  Richardson to see if he can post any consistent numbers before=20
considering him for your roster.  =20

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 12/13/00=20
 Miles missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is liste=
d=20
as day-to-day. The rookie has averaged only 6.2 points per game thus far, a=
nd=20
has no real Fantasy value at this point in the season.  =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/13/00=20
 Bryant jammed his right little finger on a dunk during Tuesday night's los=
s=20
to the Bucks. He continued to play with his finger wrapped, finishing the=
=20
game with 25 points on only 8-of-31 shooting. The diagnosis on the finger w=
as=20
only a sprain, and X-rays were negative. The injury doesn't figure to slow=

down Bryant, who has become one of the strongest players in the world of=20
Fantasy this year.   =20

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Sura did not dress for Tuesday night's game against the Blazers. He is=20
battling a strained left hamstring, and is listed as day-to-day due to the=
=20
injury. Sura has averaged 8.5 points and 5.5 assists through his first 11=
=20
games. The former Florida State star does have some Fantasy value, especial=
ly=20
in deeper leagues, but don't expect a double-digit scoring average like the=
=20
one he posted a year ago in Cleveland.   =20

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Head Coach Tim Floyd said that Miller could return from his broken hand as=
=20
early as next Tuesday against Indiana. A more likely scenario, however, wou=
ld=20
have Miller coming back on Dec. 21 in Orlando. Miller, who has missed 17=20
games thus far, was averaging 6.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. With th=
e=20
lack of talent at center, Miller could be useful to those Fantasy owners in=
=20
deeper leagues.    =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/13/00=20
 Coleman returned to practice this week and looked good during workouts,=20
according to Head Coach Paul Silas. "He's moving, practicing and running th=
e=20
court well," said Silas. The Hornets hope to have Coleman back for their=20
six-game West Coast road trip beginning on Dec. 28. Coleman does have some=
=20
Fantasy value, but don't expect his numbers to equal his 1999-'00 totals=20
until he gets back into playing shape.  =20

 Bryce Drew , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Drew, who has been sidelined with a strained hamstring, participated in hi=
s=20
first full practice on Tuesday and may return to the Bulls in time for Frid=
ay=20
night's game against Atlanta. Drew had averaged six points in four games=20
before going on the injured list on Nov. 11. With a number of point guards =
on=20
the Bulls' roster, minutes are likely to be spread around, which decreases=
=20
Drew's Fantasy value significantly. He isn't worth a roster spot at this=20
point. =20

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00=20
 Thorpe, who has been out the last month with a foot injury, was activated=
=20
for Wednesday's game against Sacramento. The veteran has very little Fantas=
y=20
value, especially on a very talented Charlotte frontcourt.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/13/00=20
 After a successful return to the court on Monday night, Hill may have take=
n=20
a step back during Wednesday night's loss to the Supersonics. He left the=
=20
game with 1:39 remaining because of discomfort in his ankle, the same ankle=

which has hampered him all season long. "My ankle felt good in the first=20
quarter, but as we got into the third and fourth quarters, it got sore," sa=

Hill. "It was hurting a lot and I was a liability out there for our=20

their roster, especially if he can't play effectively on a nightly basis.  =
 =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=

ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games th=
is=20
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, s=
o=20
keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the=20
waiver wire.   =20

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=

his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=

Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=

assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20

Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =

scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=

to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20

Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver sa=

Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=

Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=

Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=

neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The=20

Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20

leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=

to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=

alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=

per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20

I was able to change the first deal in Sitara, but the other pricing request 
I did not feel comfortable making any changes.  Would you please look at this 
pricing issue for Client Services since they need to get it paid on Monday.

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.


Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.


Thanks, Jane

The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.  It 
appears the files were not prepared by risk.  I have prepared the files and 
attached them.  Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing?  
Thanks for your help, please call with questions.

> leaders of the alumni association will have a say in the selection of
> trustees.
> The amendment calls for the creation of a nominating committee consisting

> association's board. Currently, trustees are appointed by the governor.
> On Saturday, seven nominees -- a new president, vice president, and five

> as trustees, as well as involve alumni leaders in the selection of
> trustees. That's the legislation that will go before voters.
> Less than a week before the alumni association vote was to take place, an

> "We failed to realize the steps that Mr. Lowder will go to to not allow
> any alumni involvement in the election of trustees," said Andy Hornsby, a

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...

Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?  I figure you spend 
so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.  I have a coworker going up 
there next month and it is their first time to chicago.  I gave them Etta 
James Place to go on rush and on the south side.  Can you think of any 
other?  Thanks.

Russ,

I recieved the following message from Phillip in which you requested our 
physical book org codes and what Tagg book name it is associated with.  Below 
is a list for the central desk.  If you need any other info let me know.

TAGG BOOK    ORG REGION CODE
FT-INT-CEN-MID  CENTMIDSTH
FT-INT-CEN-MID2  CENTMIDNTH
FT-INT-CEN-MKT  CENTMKTMIC

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

FYI,
The system is now open and you should have recieved an email regarding 
access.  You need to select 5 people to review you.  Please select people 
from different groups and I would suggest putting your trader on the list.  
Also, please send me a list of accomplishments for this six months.  This 
will help me in drafting my review to help represent you in the review 
meetings.  If you were not an enron employee on 1/1/2001, you will not be 
ranked with other members or your job classification, but you will still 
recieve a review.  Please shout with any questions.  Don't forget the 
deadlines from the original email.

We will take the variance on Central back page for approx. $791K for prior 
month book balance in 1100.  1100 was the first month that we switched the 
central transport flash from GD central to Intra Ontario so we flashed it 
incorrectly.  Thanks.

This is Mike Wolfe's son.  He graduates this semester from Texas Tech and is
moving back here to help his father since his mother passed away a few
months ago.  Kevin says he is a good kid and very smart.  Could you give it
Ashley or someone else at Enron.

3. Resolved roughly 5 million in operational analysis variances due to 
synthetic storage
4.  Assisted in the training of new team members
5. Assisted in the modification of the Operational Analysis process(phase 2

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as 
being not in the RisktRAC system.  Curves were found to be missing from  the 
Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.


 






SIncerely,

Subject: Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information 
(dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to 
Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen 
email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's 
internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would 
have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared 
drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are 
questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the 
sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being 
distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info 
back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the "o" drive under Corporate called 
Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential 
files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email 
address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the 
IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  
Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their 
terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

Asa & Joy,

I just wanted to take a minute and thank the two of you for your generosity 
this past week.  My friends and I had a terrific time and everyone really 
enjoyed your condo.  The weather was terrific and the fish put up a 
formidable challenge.  We are very interested in renting the condo from you 
guys during the season this year.  I requested that the cleaning charges this 
time be put on my credit card.  Please let me know if  they charge you guys 
anything.  Thanks again.  We look forward to seeing you guys soon.
Phillip

I just wanted to update you guys on the status of the EMW reports for 
Hunter.  The EMW Positions_1 file is now updated and accurate.  Every night 
when Kevin finishes his P&L file and updates the EMW Positions file, he will 
email the entire central team.  If one of us is still here, we can print out 
the necessary reports and leave them on Hunter's desk.  If no one is here, 
the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to 
Hunter with the Var report.  

For the time being Hunter will be the only one needing these reports, I will 
communicate any change in distribution that he requests.  Also for the time 
being, we will be going into Kevin's P&L file, which is in the same location 
as our intra month P&L's that we sign off on, and printing the four tabs that 
he has identified in the email attached.  When Hunter has time to review this 
format with me, we may make changes to the reports we print out.  The EMW 
positions_1 file is in the same location as our CE Positions_1 file.

Please as always, shout with any questions or concerns.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip,

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the 
following pages in the
p/l found in this directory...

O: Erms/1Intra/Central/Midwest P&L/2001/0101/EMW0117.xls

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Thanks for the help,

Kevin

Jim,  Were you able to locate this liquidation for April.  I realize it has 
been booked in TAGG between FT books, however, can you somehow get the value 
in  IM Ontario?  Let me know if I can provide you with any additional 
information that will help resolve this issue.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

FYI, you may see some January/February OA variances on Sithe due to these 
tagg numbers.  The sitara deal number involved is 543246.  Shout with any

Subject: Re: Sithe Independence -- 400 MW Turndown for January 2001  

Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 
Sithe's P&L.

1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this 
revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction 
in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe 
Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a 
financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's 
invoices.
3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the 
FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be 
modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial 
annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule 
B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the 
FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the 
FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).

These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish 
the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks.

Subject: Sithe Independence -- 400 MW Turndown for January 2001

Kam--

There was a typo for the gas volume that was used in Stacey's worksheet
to calculate the gas price.  The original spreadsheet had 11,240 Dth/day
and a gas price of $11.126/ Dth.  When you use the correct volume of
22,263 Dth/day, the gas price drops to $5.6172 for Day 1 in the attached
file.  This corrects the double-counting I told you about this morning. 

The spreadheets you sent to me calculate the power keep whole expense
on the "Gas Price" sheet.  On the sheet, it is the sum of $3,880,560 ( i.e. 
the correct
number if Day 31 is actualized rather than estimated by the power curves).

Unfortunately, Stacey's calculation does not include the transport commodity
savings, the tax expense and the amount of sharing due Sithe.  Those numbers
were provided in my memo on Friday.  If we do one of these deals again, we 
can provide Stacey with the additional expenses and revenues so that it can
be perfect calculation.  

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth

How are things going?  Good I hope.  Give me a call when you get a chance I 
need to see about getting your phone number so that I can have you cut my 
mom's grass.  She is in need of a new lawncare service.  You ought to have 
your number listed so we can get a hold of you.  Thanks.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Patrick Mulvany

FYI,
I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the 
central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced 
deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came 
out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated 
the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on 
the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed 
gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 
2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's 
price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to 
give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be 
seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my 
logic, please give me a shout. Thanks.

Subject: NCAA tournament

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.

Subject: Capital Book

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=
=20
target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

This is Mike Wolfe's son.  He graduates this semester from Texas Tech and is
moving back here to help his father since his mother passed away a few
months ago.  Kevin says he is a good kid and very smart.  Could you give it
Ashley or someone else at Enron.

Thanks <<Jerrsum2.doc>>

Can you give me a list of the deals that we have currently on APLP  and NIPS 
- they will both be in the Market CG book.  Patrice is wanting to move these 
deals to a new curve and we are trying to get a handle on the number of deals 
that will be effected.  This will be effective for april out.  Thanks.

Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have 
attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 
1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination 
was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.  
The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by 
originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will 
update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value 
was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you 
every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let 
me know.

If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please 
let me know.  Thanks.

I am planning on taking vacation 5/11 and 5/14.  Attached you will find a 
copy of the Deal Validation desk procedures that will help you out with the 
Deal Validation process.  It would be to your benefit if you took some time 
next week to sit with me for a couple of days in the morning before I go on 
vacation so that we can go over any questions or concerns you may have.  
Please take time to read these desk procedures before next week as it will 
help you better understand the Deal Validation process when you sit with me.

PGL and North Shore converted part of their index supply deal into a nymex 
fix price (basis is still floating).  Please amend the existing supply deal 
to reflect this change and confirm the supply contract ammendment as we 
discussed.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and 
GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months 
and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.  If you need any further 
information, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks for your help.

the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - 
QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 
should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the 
other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 
respectively.  Shout with any questions.  This should explain about 900,000 
of the lone liquidation problem from January.

Hello, everyone.  I just wanted to let you know as of December 1, 2000,
this will no longer be a valid email address.

My new email address is Lostincorpus@aol.com

It seems fitting on several degrees.  I hope everyone had a good
Thanksgiving.

Love Ya,

Ines.

Subject: TDS Physical Positions

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping


 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks
Russ

I had a little bird put a word in my ear.  Is there any possibility for Ben 
Raimer to be Bush's secretary of HHS?  Just curious about that infamous UTMB 
rumor mill.  Hope things are well, happy holidays.

Phillip,

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the 
following pages in the
p/l found in this directory...

O: Erms/1Intra/Central/Midwest P&L/2001/0101/EMW0117.xls

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Thanks for the help,

Kevin

OK - 
Here's the demographics on the south Florida voter - 

They can play 10 
bingo cards at a time and not miss a number. 


They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as 
well 
as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. 


They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in 
the 
Tri-fecta at the horse race. 


They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 
300 
yards away. 


They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 
200 
yds. 


They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the 
Greenpeace 
hotline. 

They can take 37 different colored pills every 
morning and never mess 
it up. 

But they can't read a 4-line 
ballot both published in the newspaper AND 

mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... 

You 
figure it out !!! 




Suddenly Florida makes Alabama and 
Mississippi look like geniuses.... 

? 

? 

"COME 
TO FLORIDA - The NEW Alabama......"

Darron,

 Can you please update the pricing for the 12/00 purchase from Agave (I 
believe it still has the 11/00 pricing) ? It is deal # 312068.

Thanks,

Hi Everybody,
It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching. I am
trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of
you. The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton.  The first
mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May. I am trying to verify
some address information before then.  If you could email me back with your
correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right
one) that would help.  Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High
School class of 1990 reunion web page.  You will be able to find out updates
on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information
on the website.  At least, that is the plan as of today.  If you can spread
the work about the website it would be appreciated.  The address will be
www.clhs90.com.

I will send out more information as I put it together.  If anyone needs to
get a hold of me you can reach me at this email address or my home number
(703) 532-8881.  I hope everyone is doing well and I look forward to seeing
everyone in September.  If you have additional addresses of fellow classmates
you can send me that would be very helpful.

Jennifer Kerber

Invitations will be going out this week.


We need your photos!  Open the attachment or check it out online to find out
more...
http://www.clhs90.com/release4.pdf


The following is the plain text version of the attached file
-------------------------------------------------------------

SEND US YOUR PHOTOS!
http://www.clhs90.com

"Memories...all alone in the moonlight..."

Remember that song? Well, now your moonlit memories can be forever captured
in cyberspace. (Well at least for a while anyway!)  We're putting together
an electronic "scrapbook" for our website, and we need your help to make it
truly representative of our class.

So how can you help?  Well, we'd would love it if you would send us five to
fifteen pictures to help us get it up and running.  When you send us your
photos, we'll group them by theme (e.g. "football" or "drama") or by your
name.  If you want, you can even write a few lines explaining each photo.
To see what the scrapbook section will look like,  please visit:
http://www.clhs90.com/scrapbook/

Basically, we think it would be boring if all the pictures in the scrapbook
were of us.  So, please, please, please send us your pictures!  C'mon. It'll
be fun!

If you want your photo memories up on the web, you have a few options.

1.  Mail them to Geneen Pipher-Boyd at 4519 71st Street #1909; Lubbock,
Texas 79424.  She'll scan them and mail them back to you within 48 hours.
2.  Send them via e-mail either as gifs or jpegs  (check for acceptability
of other file formats) to csgp@ttuhsc.edu.

Question: How do I get my photos in electronic format?
Answers:  Use a digital camera to take your pictures. Scan traditional
photos.  This can be done with your own scanner or at a print shop like
Kinko's (most locations offer scanning services for a nominal fee). Finally,
many drugstores now offer to put your photos on a CD-ROM when you take your
film in for processing.

3.  Or, if you're in the Houston area, you can arrange a photo swap with
Kathy (Voigt) Nuernberg. You can arrange this by contacting Kathy at
kathy@nuernberg-online.com .

Phillip,
I spoke with someone in our technical team about the ability to provide the 
EnronOnline price reports in a downloadable format.  What I think we can do 
is send a csv file (comma separated values) to the O:\ drive everyday 
containing all of the data that appears in the EnronOnline price reports.  
Then, you could just go in and open that it in Excel or copy and paste it 
from the csv file into Excel, which is easy.  Let me know if I can explain 
this better.  As far as saving it on the O:\ drive is concerned, I am 
currently thinking that we would just create a new folder that EOL can access 
and you can access.  This way, if any other desk has a similar request to 
yours, they can just get permission to access that folder.

We are going to finalize the details, and I will let you know how long it 
will take to get this done.  The technical person who can do it is out of the 
office until Thursday, so I am assuming we won't have a good estimate until 
then.  

I will keep you posted.
Thank you.
Julie

Subject: EOL Gas Prices

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.
Phillip

Can We Count Them with Our Nose?
Can We Count Them with Our Toes?

Should We Count Them With a Band?
Should We Count Them All By Hand?
If I Do Not Like The Count,
I Will Simply Throw Them Out.

I Will Not Let This Vote Count Stand
I Do Not Like Them, Al Gore I Am.

Can We Change These Numbers Here?
Can We Change Them, Calm My Fears?
What Do You Mean, Dubya Has Won?
This Is Not Fair, This Is Not Fun
Let's Count Them Upside Down This Time
Let's Count Them Until The State Is Mine!

I Will Not Let This Vote Count Stand!
I Do Not Like It, Al Gore I Am!

I'm Really Ticked, I'm In A Snit!
You've Not Heard The Last Of It!
I'll Count The Ballots One By One
And Hold Each One Up To The Sun!
I'll Count, Recount, And Count Some More!
You'll Grow To Hate This Little Chore

But I Will Not, Cannot Let This Vote Count Stand!
I Do Not Like It, Al Gore I Am!

I Won't Leave Office, I'm Staying Here!
I've Glued My Desk To My Rear!

We Find The Electoral College Vile!
Recount The Cotes Until I Smile.

We Do Not Want This Vote To Stand!
We Do Not Like It, Al Gore I Am!

How Shall We Count This Ballot Box?
Let's Count It Standing In Our Socks!
Shall We Count This One In A Tree?
And Who Shall Count It, You or Me?
We Cannot, Cannot Count Enough!

I Do Not Want This Vote To Stand!
I Do Not Like It, Al Gore I Am!

I've Counted Until My Fingers Bleed!
An Still Can't Fulfill My Counting Need!
I'll Count The Tiles On The Floor!
I'll Count, And Count, And Count Some More!
And I Will Not Say That I Am Done!
Until The Counting Says I've Won!

I Will Not Let This Count Stand!
I Do Not Like It, Al Gore I Am!

What's That? What? What Are You Trying To Say?
You Think The Current Count Should Stay?
You Do Not Like My Counting Scheme?
It Makes You Tense, Gives You Bad Dreams?
Foolish People, You're Wrong You'll See!
You're Only Care Should Be For Me!

I WILL NOT LET THIS VOTE COUNT STAND!
I DO NOT LIKE IT, AL GORE I AM!

If you ever have a question about your gas daily swaps and what curves to use 
take a look at this.

Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man




The ties that bind 
Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times
10/03/00
By PHILLIP MARSHALL 
Times Sports Staff 


AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.

Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as 
head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years 
of trouble, despair and losing.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
''It was defense and offense,'' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. 
''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.''
On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a 
small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback 
Heath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter 
turns it can take.

A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters 
and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about 
football. It was about matters of the heart.

''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip 
linebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the 
itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. 
We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just 
lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''

Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November 
night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has 
grown ever stronger.

It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's 
Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi 
State.

Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in 
the most difficult times.

Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly 
under control, threatened his senior season.

''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you 
for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my 
health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and 
every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was 
crying.

''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through 
something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to 
look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''

On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. 
Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad 
times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for 
their teammates and their school.

''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get 
along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys 
urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to 
get better.

''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and 
understand what it's going to take for us to win.''

The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.

''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little 
group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in 
your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''

It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college 
football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then 
came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.

They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They 
take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.

No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He 
went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when 
hardly anyone thought he could.

Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.

''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 
'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is 
worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. 
Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this 
team are like brothers.''

Leard says nothing that happens can change that.

''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special 
seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. 
We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.

''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to 
practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being 
pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''

Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of 
blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one 
who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.

''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example 
of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger 
people but for all of us.''

Subject: Re: Credit Report  

I have a few concerns about this.  We are suppossed to be the only point of 
contact for changes in tagg.  This is an internal control issue that leaves 
all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.  If other people are 
touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further 
and thus take longer to resolve.

I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current 
system?  Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?  If 
so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.

Please let me know if the others disagree with me.

Thanks.

> "Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving

> As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a

> A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: "Please take care

>
> ~~~~~~~~~~~~

> >From a Southwest Airlines employee...."Welcome aboard Southwest Flight

Unfortunately,
>none of them are on this flight!"

> Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake
>City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, "That was quite
a
>bump and I know what y'all are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't
> the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight
>attendant's fault ... it was the asphalt!"
>
> ~~~~~~~~~~~~
>
> Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a
>particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captain
was
>really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight
>Attendant said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~
>
> Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: "We
ask
>you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the

>
>~~~~~~~~~~~~
>
> An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his
>ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required
>the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile,

>his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye,
>thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had

>"Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?" "Why no Ma'am," said the pilot,
>"what is it?" The little old lady asked, "Did we land or were we shot

on

> A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a

to
>Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead

minutes,

am

Attached is the file that I use from Storey to load his curves.  It has quite 
a few tabs because he uses the model to track his positions and P&L.  The 
tabs that should be of interest to you are the upload tab - for the curve 
names and the batch tab for the curve prices.  Please give me a shout with

Phillip/Milton

Phillip, this liquidation looks like it relates to Reliant contract 813, 
Sitara deal  459075,  which was booked as a physical storage withdrawal for 
January production in the January GL.  I don't normally see liquidations for 
physical storage.  Is there anything else you can tell me about this?

Milton, can you confirm that this is really physical storage?

Thanks,
Cathy

Subject: Fwd:FW: drug recall



I don't know if this is true but I know I am going to check it out for
myself.

Subject: all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine are being recalled

A friend sent this to me and I just wanted to pass it on. I know I'm going
to clean out my medicine chest. Before I forwarded this message to anyone I

wanted to make sure that the information was true.  I checked with Rachel's

pediatrician and she verified that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine

are being recalled. I also happened to be at CVS Pharmacy and they have a
sign stating that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine have been pulled

from their shelves.

You  may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and
inquire about a refund.

Please read this carefully, as I know that some of you use some of these
drugs (Alka Seltzer Plus for one).  Also, please pass this on to everyone
you know.

Stop taking anything containing this ingredient. It has been linked to
increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in brain) among women ages 18-49 in
the three days after starting use of medication. Problems were not found in

men, but the FDA recommended that everyone (even children) seek
alternative medicine. The following medications contain
Phenylpropanolamine:

Acutrim Diet Gum Appetite Suppressant Plus Dietary Supplements
Acutrim Maximum Strength Appetite Control
Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold medicine (cherry or orange)
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine Original
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Cough Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Flu Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Sinus Effervescent
Alka Seltzer Plus Night-Time Cold Medicine Effervescent
BC Allergy Sinus Cold Powder
BC Sinus Cold Powder
Comtrex Deep Chest Cold & Congestion Relief
Comtrex Flu Therapy & Fever Relief Day & Night
Contac 12-Hour Cold Capsules
Contac 12 Hour Caplets
Coricidin D Cold, Flu & Sinus
Dexatrim Caffeine Free
Dexatrim Extended Duration
Dexatrim Gelcaps
Dexatrim Vitamin C/Caffeine Free
Dimetapp Cold & Allergy Chewable Tablets
Dimetapp Cold & Cough Liqui-Gels
Dimetapp DM Cold & Cough Elixir
Dimetapp Elixir
Dimetapp 4 Hour Liquid Gels
Dimetapp 4 Hour Tablets
Dimetapp 12 Hour Extentabs Tablets
Naldecon DX Pediatric Drops
Permathene Mega-16
Robitussin CF
Tavist-D 12 Hour Relief of Sinus & Nasal Congestion
Triaminic DM Cough Relief
Triaminic Expectorant Chest & Head Congestion
Triaminic Syrup Cold & Allergy
Triaminic Triaminicol Cold & Cough

I just found out and called the 800# for Triaminic and they
informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following medicines
because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures
in children.

Orange 3D Cold & Allergy
Cherry (Pink) 3D Cold & Cough
Berry 3D Cough Relief
Yellow 3D Expectorant

They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number on the

box so they can send you postage for you to send it back to them, and they
will also issue you a refund.

If you know of anyone else with small children, please pass this on.

Happy Birthday old man.  I am not sure if my voice mail will make it to you(I 
got some weird instructions), so I thought I would cover my bases.  I have 
been real busy at work and did not mail your gift until Friday.  It will be a

Can't beat peace and quiet.  Talk to you soon.

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as

Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.

Congrats on the future addition.  We are all doing good.  Jackson is 20 
months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our 
toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate 
program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is 
Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the 
requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he 
interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be 
able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is 
not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every 
form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for.

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

Well, did you survive the week without your husband?  I am sure things are 
alot calmer now at home.  How is the little one?  Jackson is into 
everything.  Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and 
I hung out all day.  I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.  Ash was real 
proud.

Hello!

As you know (all too well!), your job does not offer you all of the 
flexibility that you might like.  In an effort to give you a little more free 
time, we will start with the following plan.

What's a late day and who gets them?
Each book calc'er will sign up for a  one late day a month.  A late day is 
defined as a  one in which you do not come into the office until 3 p.m.   

When can I have one?
The late days to sign up for include any day Monday-Friday (excluding bid 
week thru 2nd workday).  Only one person can be out with a late day each 
day.  

Who's my back-up?
When you enjoy your late day, your back-up as defined below is responsible 
for your activities until 3 p.m.  If the following back-up schedule needs to 
change, let's make that quickly.  If you need additional security access to 
back-up someone, then put that request in immediately.  Each of the back-ups 
should "swap" jobs for a few days (until 3 p.m. to practice your 
responsibilities).  

If the back-up plan is successful, then we can potentially expand our 
creative work schedule possibilities.  We must prove that it will work, 
however, before can take any more steps.

When do we start?
All regions will implement in June. . .Irena will coordinate the calendar 
next week.

Let me know what you think!
Carrie

Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.  After 4 days in Vegas, 
please check your scores - I am still in a daze.  Kansas - please forward 
attachment to your friend Kris, Denver forward to Josh Stevens and John 
Swinney please forward to Rob Fullen.  Here are the list of people I still 
need money from:
Josh Stevens
Denver Plachy
Jimmy Simien
Eric Bass
Flannigan
Jason Wolfe

Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score 
is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).

Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is 
$307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  

The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game 
by COB Today(total score for final game):
Jason Wolfe
Denver Plachy
Scott Earnest
Chad South
Doug Friedman
John Nowlan
Lee Jackson
John Swinney
Rob Fullen
Josh Stevens

If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  

Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
differential.

Thanks everyone for playing.

differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward

Subject: New Bridge Monitor

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

FYI, I got a message from Elizabeth Hernanadez that we are missing a few of 
these sitara numbers in tagg when we are booking deals.  She fixed the ones 
we missed yesterday.  Please put these numbers in because it is vital to 
resolving OA variances that we are able to tie tagg deals to sitara.

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

Just a quick reminder to please go into your books and flip all the ECC deals 
to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of today for both January and February 
start dates.

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in 
TAGG, so please see her if you have questions on this.

Please let me know when all the January deals have been fixed so I can start 
the invoicing process.  

Thanks for your help.
Stacey

These may still be a work in progress.... I have meetings with Victor 
Lamadrid and Tricia Bowen (Logistics leads for the East)  today and hopefully 
a meeting with Bob Superty and with Randy Gay (Logistics manager in the West) 
later this week.  I will also be spending time with Kim Olinger and Jeff

Jim,
Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.  
This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.  The 
Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.  
Please shout with any questions.  Jennifer, this should eliminate the current 
outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have 
been cleaned up.  The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due 
to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.  I believe the 
variances will be a gain.
Thanks for you help guys.

There appears to be about 7 people that are not going to make it, leaving us 
about 5 people.  Therefore, as we agreed several seasons ago, every body 
needs to drop ten bucks in the kitty for the forfeit deposit.

Southern Company Energy Marketing, LP has changed its name to Mirant Americas

Phillip, if I left anyone out of your group, please forward this on.

I got an update from Bryce.  In the back of the publication for 1/2/01(page 
7), there are prices for the 30th & 31st.  It appears the 30th & 31st got pub 
posted at the first page of the 1/2/01 publication.  Therefore, we are going 
to see OA on these deals.

FYI,
I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the 
central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced 
deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came 
out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated 
the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on 
the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed 
gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 
2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's 
price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to 
give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be 
seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my 
logic, please give me a shout. Thanks.

Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

Shirley McDowell
Project Manager/Trader Web-site

Here is the email reminder of the curve setting process.  After you set your 
curves(do not hit finished file), go to the GD Pmgr tab and change the date 
in the left hand corner to two business days out(Friday set for Tuesday).  
Then go to the CurveFetch tab and place your file on automatic calc(can not 
hit F9).  Then hit fetch Prices button.  Prices should be brought in for 
current date.  Go to the AutoCurve tab and hit paste curves.  When this is 
done, hit finished file and the date will be updated so that I know your 
curves are ready to load in ERMS.  Please feel free to shout with any 
questions.  Thanks.

Phillip,

I think I told you that my boss, LTC Dowling, has decided to retire from the
Army.  He is real interested in moving to Houston.  He has family there.  A
guy he knows (who apparently works for Enron, but I'm not sure) suggested he
try there for a job.  while we were travelling together last week, we were
at Applebys, eating dinner and watching the Astro's.  I mentioned that mys
son's company paid a bunch of money for that stadium.  When Ed heard that,
he asked if you might take a resume in for him.  I kind of volunteered you.
Then I got to thinking, I think I remember you saying that you get some kind
of reward if they hire someone you recommend.

In my opinion, and you know I have those, any company that gets this guy has
found a gold mine.

If it's a problem, I'll understand.  But if it's possible, I'd really
appreciate you taking a copy of this to Enron.  And, by the way, I told Ed
several weeks ago, before I knew he was retiring, that if and when he needed
my help, call me and I'd come work for him again.  So, who knows, if he gets
on in Houston, I might get an opportunity to move there too.

Thanks,

Pop

P.S.  Don't forget, I'll be out of town most of the week.

How are things in Denver?  I haven't heard from you in a while and I thought 
I would drop you a line.  I have the picture of all of us from that mexican 
food restaurant off of Westheimer under my mouse pad and I was thinking about 
you.

How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new 
living situation?  It can be tough at first, but as long as you are patient, 
everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  

Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible.  
They blew another 7 run lead last night.  At least the stadium is really 
nice, otherwise I would be very dissappointed that I got tickets.  I hope 
your parents are still enjoying the seats. 

Talk to you soon.

Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn 
Menear.  THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.  THe product type is US 
GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.  This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve 
adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.  Robyn sets this curve everyday as a 
basis curve.  Thanks.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to shout.

Just to keep you posted....

The offsetting liquidations($1,000,000 in revenue) for these two deals was 
sitting in the West Fred file.  It looks West already took this to the desk, 
so Theresa will get with Darren to reverse their take and reclass this to 
Central.

Thanks for your help with this.

should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the

There are two items in the June Central Fred file that we need help with:

look?
Transport    $480,272    Can you provide any detail for what is included here?

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.


Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: Re: TDS Position Flag  

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,
Jeremy

Subject: TDS Position Flag

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does 
not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the

Subject: changing deal locations

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.

FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about 
unofficialized post id's.  We run a macro every night to verify these are 
officialized.  I just want to remind everyone that this is very important 
that we do this.  Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these 
errors continue.  Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on 
this currently.  Thanks.

My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a 
better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.

I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms 
are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are 
usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas 
causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.

Jim

There are two items in the June Central Fred file that we need help with:

NB0242.B    $768,761    Phillip says this is not Central's.  Can you take a 
look?
Transport    $480,272    Can you provide any detail for what is included here?


Thanks for your help.

Cathy

Oh....the old profit and loss.  I haven't had to deal with that nightmare 
since
MBA, which I can say I am happy about.  No, I did not throw away any pictures 
of
you.  Just Tom and the 2 I have of Justin (a.k.a. ass).  I would never do 
that!!
Should I even toy with the statement "things would be alot different"?  Just
kidding!!  No, I am sure we would be the best of friends like always.  Hey, do
you still have that picture your mom took of us forever ago?  Back in the day?
Just curious....sometimes I like to see how much I have aged!  About coming
home, I have no immediate plans for a visit.  I have been swamped.  My wedding
plans are coming along good and I am getting ready to move into Jason's (Dad 
is
not too happy about that one).  I think I will be in there by the second week 
of
May.  Anyhow, as soon as some time frees up I will come home.  When I do, do 
you
think you really will have a free schedule.....doubt that one!!  Family life 
(I
am sure) keeps you busy.  Hopefully this time I will be able to see your 
little
one.  OK, I am going to say one more thing I shouldn't (but what the
heck).....Ashley gave me a picture of me holding Jackson and I couldn't help 
but
wonder what if.  Sorry if that is bad.....but one day all of that will be 
gone.
Jason is completely wonderful..

Profit and Loss.  I forgot that you are in the touchy feely are of
corporate life.  The new position is very challenging and educational so
far.
I just found out that the last rockets game is on Wednesday of this week
and I have my softball league on that night.  I guess I will have to record
it and watch it later.  Oh, Well.
That is great about Kelly.  We have no immediate plans to add to the
family.  The one is keeping us plenty busy as it is.
I hope you didn't throw out any pictures of me last night(that would be
rude).  I am sure if we lived closer that things would be a lot different
and we would interact a lot more(outta site outta mind).
Do you have any plans to come back to town anytime soon?  Be sure and give
me some notice so that I can clear the old schedule.  Talk to you soon.

OK, not to be stupid but...what are P&Ls???  I suppose the management
consulting
world does not use that.  Well, I guess I figured that you would be staying
in
Houston.  Are you happy in your new position?  If you ever did come up
here, it
would be fabulous!!  Maybe we will settle on visits for now.

Dad would be really happy to go to the Rockets last game.  They were in
town
here last Tues., but I was in Seattle for work.

How are you liking your new house?  Are you and Ashley planning on any more
kids?  Any time soon?  Kelly Houge is preg. and is due November 28.  It
will be
weird not having her at my wedding.....

I was going through pictures last night....throwing out the ones that had
ex-boyfriends in them....and thought of you.  Not the ex-boyfriend
part...but I
did run into pics with you in them.  I really wish that we could be more a
part
of each other's lives.  It would be fun....maybe one day you really will
take a
job out here.  Wishful thinking I suppose!!

Rachel

Tell Jimmy hi for me!!  Is he dating??

I got jimmy on last October.  He seems to be enjoying it.

The new stadium is phenomenal.  It really looks like an old time park.  I
need to call you dad and see if he wants to go to the rockets season
finale.  Rumor has it that Charles is going to play so that he can walk off
the court on his own power.

I just took another job within enron working for the east desk doing daily
gas P&L's.  Should be challenging with high exposure.  So, it looks like we
will not be coming to denver any time soon, with the exception of this
fall.

Your dad did look a little different, but I got used to it pretty quick.  I
am sure it will be a little more difficult for you.  Take care.

Hey!!  So, how is the new field?  Were you able to make it on opening day?
My
parents really enjoyed it.  Speaking of, what do you think of my Dad
without any
facial hair?  They are coming up to visit this month and I am afraid to see
him!!

I noticed that Jimmy (from your email) is working for Enron...when did this
happen?

Are you still looking to transfer here....hurry up!!!!!

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

Subject: Killing physical deals

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

I put together a spreadsheet to look at the lone liquidations we have on the 
summary pages that we will be presenting today and then looking at what is 
going to hit in the next month.  All the turnarounds you mentioned to me for 
January did happen, but in total we booked another $4 million of expense.  
This spreadsheet lists the lone liquidations from November and December 
production down the far left column and ties to our current summary 
schedule.  I put the new liquidations from January production on the right.  
I hope this is useful to you.



Thanks,
Cathy

Sam-
Here is a little something about my grandfather:

 Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic 
Institute, now Auburn University.  He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years 
in Haleyville, Alabama.  Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 
grandchildren and one great grandchild.  Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and 
tremendous football fan.  He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 
years.  Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University 
in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.  Dr Burgess was a World War II 
veteran.  Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and 
both grandchildren to school on the plains.  Due to his love for Auburn that 
he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation 
Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.  Dr. Burgess was also a proud member 
of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.  Dr. Burgess was born in 
Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.  

Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the 
things I stated above.  Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and 
the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.  Auburn is very 
fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important 
school within the University. Talk to you soon.

Here are updated schedules from our discussions this morning.  I think these 
have all the cell notes, with the exception of the last few months synthetic 
storage detail.  I will get you that next, Phillip.  Also, I will bring you 
copies of the Engage payments for May 2000.

Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and 
GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months

There has to be an adjustment in TAGG, because both the FT ONT and FT NY 
books have captured this value and received the offsetting liquidation.  If 
the IM NY and IM ONT books have offsetting value you can roar reclass the 
difference.

Jim,  Were you able to locate this liquidation for April.  I realize it has 
been booked in TAGG between FT books, however, can you somehow get the value 
in  IM Ontario?  Let me know if I can provide you with any additional 
information that will help resolve this issue.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

Just wanted to remind everyone, party at my house on May 19th starting around 
4 p.n., probably eat around 6-6:30.  I am going to write out a map shortly 
and hand it out.  Please let me know if you can not attend and if you prefer 
any beer preferences(will have plenty of non alcoholic and wine and booze for 
PRyder).  Don't forget to bring your dates so my wife has someone to talk 
to.  Let me know if dogs or cats bother you so I can put them out(especially 
the damn cats).

Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central

highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I 
then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and 
let us know what type of detailed support you will need.  Thanks.

Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify 
accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the 
second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes 
second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are 
out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams 
remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a 
charitable deduction for your $10).

FYI-
We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for 
physical deals.  We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production 
because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.  Usually 
these are less than .05 different.  If you have a physical mich physical it 
should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), 
if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.  Any 
questions, ask.  Thanks.

David, per my telephone message to you today, I am attaching a resume for 
Lena Zhu.  Lena is needing to relocate from our Portland office as soon as 
possible.  We have to find a home for her immediately.  Her choices are very 
slim; therefore, she cannot be very picky at this time.  She was originally 
needing to move out of the program in August, 2001 but her time has been 
extended to December, 2001 at which time, she will need promote to an 
Associate.  Please review her resume and if you are interested in talking to 
Lena, you may call her directly.  I will contact you to discuss your interest.


Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Second Presidential Debate Transcript
>
>Jim Lehrer: Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice
>President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on
>these rules:
>I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question and deliver
>rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters. The
opponent
>will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens

>into voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper
>softly while he continues to spew  incomprehensible statistics for three
>more minutes.
>
>Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name of
a
>downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
>strains the bounds of common sense?
>Gore: As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love
>the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage,
the

Glenda,
Hope everything is going well for you guys.  I just wanted to take a minute 
and thank you for the easter  gift you sent Jackson.  It was very 
thoughtful.  He has enjoyed coloring the book and everything else he can get 
his hands on.  He also ate all of the chocolate as fast as he could.  He is 
getting really big and really independent.  We are headed to Jazz fest this 
weekend in New Orleans, I am sure he will really enjoy it this year.  Take 
care and we will talk to you soon.  Thanks again.
Love,
Jackson, Ashley & Phillip

Can you please advise your groups to contact either EOL or Jay Krish or Dat 
Truong when you find a sitara hedge not linked to the sitara physical deal?  
Once you find this, please do not create or kill the hedge until the sitara 
team has a chance to look at the deals.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks

We have received the April Liquidation file from portfolio accounting.  We 
are now up to 89%(Tagg deals containing Sitara #'s) with only a small handful 
containing Sitara #'s that are invalid(13).  Thanks for the work that you and 
your groups have done to make it easier to match up deals on the back end of 
the process.  Again, thank you.

Per Bass-
like last year we get 13 guys, one must remain on IR for the entire week.  
Note - the person does not have to be injured.

Pickups and drops are every monday.

If you do not know how to add/drop, ask any of us from last year.

One of the saddest parts of the demise of Alabama coach Mike DuBose is his
growing inability to control the bad apples in the program.
A few of Alabama's players, sensing DuBose's lame-duck status, have been
acting like thugs. The latest example of the inmates running the asylum:
On the final play of the Tide's loss to Central Florida, senior fullback
Dustin McClintock blocked Central Florida freshman Commer Rucker to the
ground, sat on him and reportedly punched him several times in the face.
DuBose told one reporter he didn't want to comment until he spoke to
McClintock.
According to media reports in Alabama, DuBose is "concerned" that something
like that had happened for the second week in a row. Concerned enough to
take harsh disciplinary action such as suspending the guilty party for part
of the next game?
Cheap shots are getting to be a habit at Bama. In the closing minutes of the
Tennessee game, Alabama's Hirchel Bolden took out his frustrations with a
shot to the chin of UT punter David Leaverton, who was nearly 45 yards from
where the punt was rolling on the turf. Leaverton required 9 stitches to his
face.
Because no penalty was called, some Tide supporters defended Bolden. The
following day, DuBose said such behavior wouldn't be tolerated. However, his
threat rings hollow because he never backed it up with stiff sanctions.
McClintock obviously never got the message. His actions and DuBose's
reaction (or lack thereof) speak volumes about the state of the Tide's
program.

I have made a slight revision to the template regarding CPR Cash In and CPR  
Cash Out for consistency between Accounting, OA, and Economics.  

OA CODE 15 CASH IN  SALE
OA CODE 14 CASH OUT PURCHASE

Please replace the previous template with the one below.

Phillip,

Andy Lewis is setting up a new gas daily index and I need to map the correct 
indexes in EOL.  I am assuming for IF GD/D NGPL MidCont, it needs to be 
mapped as IF-NGPL/MIDCON and I need the GDP index for NGPL/MIDCON.  Can you 
please let me know at your earliest convenience?

Thanks,
Dawn

Hi guys,

Because of the EOL group putting in language to automatically flip deals to 
the P& book as soon as they are booked, the number of deals to be flipped at 
the end of the month has decreased quite a lot, but there are always some 
stragglers that are left behind.  Here is what I've come across.  Could you 
please flip these deals before the end of the week.

FT-EAST



FT-ONTARIO



G-DAILY-EST



GD-CENTRAL



As far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.  
I've gone through all the other books that I could
think of, but I might have missed some.  Could you please make sure that I'm 
not missing any deals.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know 
when these have been flipped.

Thanks for all your help again.

Stacey

Kam asked that I email you guys about the FT-ONTARIO book move.  Please move 
the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.  This 
also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in 
the curve table.  This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.  Thanks for 
you help and please shout with any questions.

The security desk, has changed TDS access approval from Bill Kasemervisz to 
each respective desk lead.  
The attached application should be saved on your C:drive and used to grant 
access to people that you want to have access to your desk.
The application is pretty self explanatory, however if you have any questions 
please give me a call.

FYI - not sure if anyone ahs been putting vacation time in on a time sheet.  
I got a report and most everyone's was blank.  If you believe this to be an 
error, see me and I will show you the list.  I am not calling anyone out for 
cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.  I draw your 
attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end 
of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to 
carry over 40 hrs.  Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 
hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.  I have attached the 
site for your time sheets.  You will need your P# and password to access, 
contact security if you do not have either.  If you need help filling this 
out, let me know.  I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two 
weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.  Thanks.

Government News Keywords: MILITARY COURTESY TO THE PRESIDENT Source: CNN
Posted on 02/15/2001 11:44:53 PST by Hurtgen
This morning CNN showed George W. leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step
saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right
face to stand facing GW's back...something that was missing in eight years
of the Clinton presidency.
The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new
president. That one goes back to the days in the rigging, when the marine
orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of
movement, to be ready to receive an order.
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone?
..And for eight years, they did.

Subject: Canadian Logic uploaded this weekend into EOL

Jeff and Kathy,

After much testing, the logic will be placed into production this evening 
that will book the two legs for the counterparties that have master 
agreements with ECC and hit a US product.  I have had Victor Guggenheim 
review the following deals in tagg stage but you may want to review as well 
and let me know if everything looks alright.

QT8025  Dynegy Canada
QT8034  TransCanada

This logic will create the two legs for the price and basis swaps when a 
counterparty with a master agreement with ECC hits a US product.  The first 
leg will be between ECC and the external counterparty and risk assigned to 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS.  The second leg is simply the flip from FT-US/CAND-ERMS to 
the appropriate US book (the book mapped at the product level).   These 
examples illustrate this logic.  This logic is also set up for the 40+ 
counterparties that have the master agreements with ECC.

If you see any problems with the example deals or in the logic described 
above, please call me before end of business today so we can stop this from 
going into production.  Please forward to you groups to inform them of the 
change.  Please let us immediately if something is not correct on these deals 
on Monday.

Thank you,
Dawn

Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank

Due to the significant amount of activity on EnronOnline, and the large 
number of users logged into the system during peak trading hours, please 
inform your respective teams that they should not use the EnronOnline 
applications (Reports, Product Manger, Profile Manager, and Data Manager) 
between the hours of 7:30am and 10:00am.  Only those actions that are 
absolutely critical should be performed (i.e. credit headroom adjustments, 
etc.).  

The IT group is reviewing the database in an attempt to make our queries more 
efficient, but until further notice, these guidelines should be followed.

Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks-
Sheri

Hi guys,

Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that 
still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today.

FT-CENT     

QU4059.1

FT-NORTHWEST



FT-ONTARIO



FT-WEST



GD-CENTRAL



NG-EXOTIC

QY3631.1

NG-PRICE



These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking 
for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If 
you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your 
help

Stacey

Phillip, I rejected your security request because you already had access to 
Sitara.  I just modified your existing security profile by removing your 
access to the East and granting you access to the Central desk.  In order for 
the change to be effective, you will need to get completely out of all open 
Sitara applications and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call 
me at x35423.

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.

Attached are the fred files for the requested months.  I have to revise the 
0002 column on the summary schedule.  I lumped everything by mistake into the 
FT adjustment column.  We have to have 2 of the liquidations tsf to 
Transport.  On this one, look at the recon variances tab and answer my 
questions.  On 9911 look at the AVAR tab.  The deals highlighted in brown is 
the one that gas accounting - Jim Little should be reviewing.  On 9909 look 
at the AVAR tab and the three deals highlighted in yellow.  You will notice 
some of the same deal numbers here.  Let me know what you think.

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change

As Marina and I discussed this morning, accounting requests that we 
officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them 
to run reports.  We do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons: 
1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are 
captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).  If we were to officialize 
these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing 
half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.  2) 
All of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third 
parties.  

To keep this action from disrupting your group, the risk leads will forward 
an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request.  
The following is the list Rachel Crowell in Acctg. asked us to officialize on 
3/12/01:
1054100
1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689
1055194
1055195
1055196

Please shout with any questions, thanks.

Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.
Julie

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

I am the last one to have a problem with people throwing balls around.  
However,  Frank Vickers had a client from another firm here today and people 
were shooting baskets while the clients were looking on.  I'm sure 
professionalism is not the first thing they thought of as they were watching 
this.  While it is important that everyone have fun,  it is more important 
that we are a seen as a professional organization.  We are on the same floor 
as the originators and therefore there will be many clients coming through 
here in the future.  It would be a shame not to get business because someone 
in our group was firing jumpers.  Thanks for your help in ensuring that this 
doesn't happen again.

I received your name and contact information from Lia Halstead, whom I am in
class with in the University of Houston's PMBA program.  Please find
attached my resume for your review.  I graduated from Texas A&M with a B.S.
in Chemical Engineering and am currently working on an MBA.  My experience
has been in operations management, but my plan is to  transition into a more
business/commercial function so that I can continue to grow professionally.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

I wanted to let you guys know that I changed the files.  I had one deal with 
FT Central that was in the physical file that was financial.  I transferred 
the deal to Sheetal's file.  I also added the sitara numbers to the physical 
file.  Sorry for the mishaps.

Attached are the spreadsheets you requested.  The first tab - 100 is the same 
sheet as the one we discussed earlier.  The second tab 60.40 is the sheet 
that assumes Tom only gets 40% and Sharpe gets the asset deals.  The third 
tab is the revised summary sheet for all months if the 60.40 split is the 
route we choose to go.  Please feel free to give me a call with any 
questions.  Thanks.

Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.
Julie

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.

FYI,

I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind.  
So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new 
deal problems.  Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and 
new deals should be tied out before calcing.  I know you guys almost always 
do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be 
watching us even closer now.  

Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra 
month trader.  I also heard this request from Hunter.

Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work.

Dawn,
thanks for putting this information in the paper.  Hopefully a student from 
Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.

A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H. Burgess has been set up at the school of 
Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.  The scholarship has been ear 
marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an 
interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess 
dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he 
practiced for 35 years.

If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you 
can do so as follows:
Auburn University Foundation
c/o Sam Hendrix
317 South College Street
Auburn University, AL 36849

Please make checks payable to the Auburn University Foundation
Any contributions are fully tax deductible
Any questions, please contact Dr. Burgess' grandson Phillip Love 281-486-7026

Please feel free to modify this in any way.  Thanks for your assistance. 
PL

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change 
effective Feb. 1.

Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system 
for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing 
tonight.  Thanks.

Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our 
traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for 
the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is 
very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not 
always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning 
and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is 
very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: RE: Star VPP

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.

Hello!

I will meet you in the middle. . .work until noon on Friday, and then get out 
of here.  It is hard to justify our team taking the entire day off since our 
responsbilities are not completely dependent on daily trading activities or 
nomination activities.  That, of course, IS TRUE for Logistics and Risk.

To be consistent, I will give the OA team the same info.  Volume Mgmt. and 
Settlements will be jealous.

Thanks,
Carrie

0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora

Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn

line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.

Attached is the liquidation support for July.  I am still in the process of 
tying these deals to the General Ledger and currently the difference is 
sitting in the Texas Region as the problem is most likely related to the 
financial deals on Co. 12.  Please do your research as usual and I will give 
you a detailed list of any changes if it relates to your region.

Brain,
 Also Jackson Logan should not be in 103817, but should be in 103833.  

 Mick Walters went to HPL, effective March 15.  And before then he was in 
cost center 103833, not 103817.

P lease reclass and let me know when this is complete.
 

tThank you,

LTC Dowling, 
I will do everything I can to get you to Houston, for selfish reasons.  I 
know if you move here, there is a good chance my Dad will follow you.  Thanks 
for the info and if you see a position on the website that I miss, just let 
me know and I will get your resume down there.  Have a good weekend.
Phillip

FYI, 
Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.  The 
reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that 
should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as 
opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.  What 
typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes 
to the desk entirely at mid.  This is causing some substantial OA variances.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

You are the cedar tree and the comments pretty much all apply.  I am the elm
tree, pretty close too, huh.  Jimmy might get a kick out of this since he is
into astrology.

Fin Liq N08617.3    164,300
Transport Exp     174,300 (I will bring you detail)

Pacific Gas & Electri Pur Liq.(EV9437.7)  217,808

I have left out the California Energy Hub actual variance, because it nets 
with a PG&E Energy Trading(N05499.3) variance.

Subject: broker changes

The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Patrick Mulvany

Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a 
financial liquidation problem from 0007.  I have a deal NR2989.1 that is 
showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production 
month.  When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to 
NG-Price.  I do not believe this should be in the central region.  Any 
assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had 
yesterday regarding financial liquidations.  Thanks for your help guys.  
Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin. liq.

how it works, but here it is.

Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday 
and the farwell deal.  Please review and let me know if you agree with this.  
If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet 
amounts.  We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange 
being included in this model.  For the foreign exchange,  I took an average 
exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.  Thanks.

Hello!

I wanted to pass on a compliment that you all received this weekend. . . 

Jason Williams told me that the entire Central risk team was "extremely 
helpful and patient", that you "respond to requests with a great attitude," 
and that he was especially impressed with your responsive to the traders' 
requests even though these things cause you to stay later in the evening.

Keep it up!  You impress people!
Carrie

Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Phillip and/or Kam,

Jim Little booked some liquidation pmas in 10/00 GL for 05/00 production for 
Central region.  I'm not able to tie these taggs to a Sitara deal so I'm not 
sure what to do with them.  Can you help?

ND2875.3     Consumers Gas  93,000 revenue  Jim says this should probably be 
reclassed to Ontario, but I don't have any open issues related to Ontario and 
I       don't know what the Sitara link is.

EC3704.7     Enron Canada            19,848 revenue  The tagg references 
Sitara #313723 but when I try to open it, I get an access denied message, any 
clues what this       is? 

ND9423.1    Enron Canada 23,249 revenue I didn't see a Sitara reference on 
this tagg, either.

He also booked a pma for 760,000 of expense for Consumers on tagg NF9881.1 
but it looks to me like we've already booked this one in the original 
liquidation file, so I've asked him to research that one.

Thanks for your help.

Cathy

It was great to hear from you.  Things are going well for me at Enron. I am 
on the trading floor working with the natural gas traders.  The work is fast 
paced and very educational.  

How is your family doing?  I hope it is still expanding with recent grand 
children.

I was sorry to hear of your leaving NSF.  They are definitely going to miss 
your expertise and committment.  I am sure however, that you are exciting 
about the "time off".  

Please stay in touch and if you are ever passing through Houston, please look 
me up.  I look forward to talking with you soon.

Subject: Hands free cellular telephones




I?don't know if you've heard, but starting Jan 1,2001 you  will 
nolongerbeable  use a cell phone while driving unless you have a "hands 
free"adapter.?  I went to Circuit City and they wanted $50 for a hands 
freeadapter!!!?

Ihave managed to get hold  of some "off brand" units and was 
wonderingifanyone is interested. These kits  are compatible with any 
mobilephone  andone size fits all. I paid $8 each for  buying in quantity. 
I'msellingthemfor  $10. I tried them out on Erisson, Motorola, & Nokia phones 
andtheyworked perfectly. A photo is attached. Take a look and let me 
knowifyouwant one.

Hi All -

The following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) project status:

TRV system training for Region Leads began last week.  Currently, Kam, 
Phillip, Darron and Winfree have received training and Errol is scheduled for 
tomorrow (5/15).

One request that came out of training was to provide a "left column freeze" 
in order to scroll across and still maintain what row is being reviewed.  Hal 
will follow up on this request.  Please forward me any additional requests 
that may be required or suggestions you may have. 

Please publish your region's report daily.  This will ensure report history 
is being established and provide realistic information to review during UAT.  
Also, we ask that each one of you review the system as much as possible 
during the UAT review period this week to ensure the system is working 
properly and is meeting your expectations. 

Thank you for your help and support!

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy
The Associated Press
3/18/2001 
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the 
worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not 
be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. 
When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was 
essentially fired. 
"Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the 
season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told 
that and came and negotiated out of his contract," Muse said. 
More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum
Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose 
team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did 
not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. 
"That's how David and I worked," Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview 
from his Orlando home. "We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted 
me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be 
enough (to save his job)." 
Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the 
meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. 
Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until "the wee hours of the morning," 
then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and "urged 
him to stay until the end of the season." 
Muse said that was "the most celebrated case" of Lowder taking such a direct 
role in athletic decisions, but "there are many others." 
Bowden often commented that "Mr. Lowder hired me" and that the coach had 
"regular contact" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke 
with Lowder "weekly, if not daily" during his first two or three seasons, but 
"never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I 
should do it." 
Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search 
committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 
1993. 
"Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me 
hired," said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. "There's no doubt 
about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn." 
Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his 
coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling 
the strings on that decision. 
Bowden "always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of 
Lowder's influence," Muse said. "So he believed very strongly that he had to 
maintain that relationship." 
Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime 
defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. 
Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's 
successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff 
Ellis has "very, very frequent contact" with the Montgomery banker. 
Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. 
Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' 
athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide "support and input" to the

accomplishments and "stop bickering."

Phillip,

Each month we (in accounting) pull the forward detail for the post ids which 
were officialized at month end.  For February 2001, these post ids are on the 
Report page in the FT Intra Ontario file but they are not officialized in 
RunM:

1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689

Were there other post ids which were officialized for these particular 
rolls?  If not, would you please officialize these so I can pull them.

Best regards,

Rachel

The FRED file for Ontario did not include flashed liquidations detail.  It 
appears the files were not prepared by risk.  I have prepared the files and 
attached them.  Do you mind including this in the FRED file and reissuing?  
Thanks for your help, please call with questions.

Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg

I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations 
file.  There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we 
flashed and what detail we now have.  We will have to take this adjustment to 
the P&L(wil be expense).  I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or 
LT Transport.  I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you 
each month by Cernosek's group.  For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed 
($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).  The detail in this 
file plus these three numbers should tie out.  If not, please let me know.  
Shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank
