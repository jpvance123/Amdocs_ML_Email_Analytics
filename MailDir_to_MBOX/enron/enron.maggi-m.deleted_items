Great on this end!  Phoenix Open tomorrow, 1:20 tee time Sat at the 500
Club, taking the boat out Sunday on Canyon Lake.  It's a wild sight to drop
a line, real in rainbow, all within forty feet of Saguaro cactus.

I hear UBS is locking folks in at this point, or at least trying.  What
percentage of existing natgas/power front office will be retained?  I would
assume they'll leave the operation in Houston?

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to.

Brian,

As we discussed earlier today, Enron North America Corp. (ENA) desires to re-establish its account with Paribas.  The purpose of this account would be to sell no more than 2,500 NYMEX natural gas futures contracts to hedge natural gas storage inventory for the months of February, March and April, 2002.  Please advise me as soon as possible regarding what ENA will need to do to re-establish its account.  Please call me with questions at (w) 713-853-7657 or (m) 713-582-8379.

Regards,
Ed McMichael
Vice President

Well, first of all, let's stop talking about $14.00 for a while... The stubborn
facade I was wearing in the face of mounting bullish evidence was not the way to
go as Friday capped a very impressive performance last week. So, leason learned;
listen to whatever system you trust because a system takes human nature out fo
the equation.  The bull trap Friday looked like the real thing for most of the
day, with heavy spread depreciation and fund selling, but with about an hour to
go you could sense something was amiss. So for now we've done what we needed to
do technically and it has to be respected. The overall long term trend remains
decidedly bearish but short term we've gone bullish, medium term neutral.
Petrologistics shows OPEC sans Iraq at 657,000 b/d over the new quota, pretty
much what has been bandied about recently. Gasoline relationships have held like
a rock and April-June gas cracks are now back into the mid/high $7.00 range.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Friday confirmed all the ominous signs from earlier in the week, i.e. weak
spreads, lack of short covering after a large down move, and particularly
gasoline's erosion. All these things pointed to the market's seeing gasoline as
vulnerable and laid the groundwork for this week, which has all the makings a
very sharp and quick sell off. Gann lines show the close below $19.70 to be
significant and point to a very quick move towards $17.20. I would not be
surprised to see this achieved this week as the move accelerates. Gasoline will
be particularly hard hit with Q2 gas cracks seen as a target. The problem with
gasoline this year stems from distillate. Even a solid turnaround schedule will
not lead to much, since an abundance of heating oil and lack of sustained cold
weather will give refiners a nice margin for error. Gas, even though the demand
picture should stay firm, is seen as the one component that has some fat left in
it; Everything else has had premium and margins taken out of it already. The
only thing to watch for is a reversal, since we finsihed Friday on the day's
low.  Look out below.....

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

As you may know, the only person more arrogant than an investment banker is
someone in private equity.  Investment bankers pride themselves on making
vast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takes
devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while
making even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren.
Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenly
believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and
charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of
capital, as Karl Marx so astutely described.

Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire at
the Carlyle Group.  After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst at
Merrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea
working as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team.  Working at a
private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (which
would be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times a
week, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to "learn a
little bit of the buyside business" so he can begin nightly visits.  Already
a self-described "stud" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked to
the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign
men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly
$12,600 per person).  By making in excess of ten times the average national
wage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals
were attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship.  Thus bolstered by an
initial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out
on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea.

As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five
"hot chicks."  According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly one
billion "hot chicks" remaining in Korea.  Clearly there is a break in
Chung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the
global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks,
but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls
off or he dies of exhaustion.  Sadly, Chung cannot complete his mission
alone.  The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S.
standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and he
needs your help to continue his quest for infamy.  If you would like to
contribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of a
FDA-approved "domes" to the address below:

Peter Chung
The Carlyle Group
Suite 1009, CCMM Bldg.
12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-ku
Seoul 150-010, Korea

Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight
courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection.
Alternatively, if you would like to pursue a job working for The Carlyle
Group in Korea, write to the following address:

The Honorable James A. Baker
1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Suite 220 South
Washington, DC 20004-2505

Please note that Mr. Baker, the lead spokesperson for The Carlyle Group, a
the former Secretary of State from the George Herbert Walker Bush
Administration.  Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued his
international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by
supporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung.

For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read Peter
Chung's travelogue (attached).  Please keep in mind that Chung's experience
is partially a function of his prior status as a "stud" and may not be
reflective of private equity experiences in general.  Not all of us can hope
to be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung.

Regards,

Justin

So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say,
LIFE IS GOOD....

I've got a spanking brand new 2000 sq. foot 3 bedroom apt. with a 200 sq.
foot terrace running the entire length of my apartment with a view
overlooking Korea's main river and nightline......Why do I need 3 bedrooms?
Good question,.... the main bedroom is for my queen size bed,...where CHUNG
is going to fuck every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years (5 down,
1,000,000,000 left to go).... the second bedroom is for my harem of
chickies, and the third bedroom is for all of you fuckers when you come out
to visit my ass in Korea.  I go out to Korea's finest clubs, bars and
lounges pretty much every other night on the weekdays and everyday on the
weekends to (I think in about 2 months, after I learn a little bit of the
buyside business I'll probably go out every night on the weekdays).  I know
I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phone
numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go
home with me every night I go out.  I love the buyside,.... I have bankers
calling me everyday with opportunties and they pretty much cater to my
every whim - you know (golfing events, lavish dinners, a night out
clubbing). The guys I work with are also all chilll - I live in the same
apt building as my VP and he drives me around in his Porsche (1 of 3 in all
of Korea) to work and when we go out.  What can I say,.... live is good,...
CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul.....

So,.... all of you fuckers better keep in touch and start making plans to
come out and visit my ass ASAP, I'll show you guys an unbelievable
time....My contact info is below....
Oh, by the way,... someone's gotta start fedexing me boxes of domes,...I
brought out about 40 but I think I'll run out of them by Saturday.....

Laters,
CHUNG

Mike, I hope you had a nice time in Florida.  Amy and I had a great time with Matty over the weekend.  He is so cute and was very well-behaved for us.

I was just looking at the Enron website again.  I was reading more about the analyst program, which sounds like a great learning opportunity.  I understand that you may not be able to help me right now, as the market is somewhat tight.  I would definitely appreciate your trying.  I have attached my resume for you to review or forward to the appropriate personnel.

I am excited about the opportunity, and, of course, the possibilities.

Thanks again Mike.

Eliot

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp.

While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Mike, I hope you had a nice time in Florida.  Amy and I had a great time with Matty over the weekend.  He is so cute and was very well-behaved for us.

I was just looking at the Enron website again.  I was reading more about the analyst program, which sounds like a great learning opportunity.  I understand that you may not be able to help me right now, as the market is somewhat tight.  I would definitely appreciate your trying.  I have attached my resume for you to review or forward to the appropriate personnel.

I am excited about the opportunity, and, of course, the possibilities.

Thanks again Mike.

Eliot

It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

Enron has consented to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search the Enron Building and to interview employees regarding allegations of document destruction.  The company encourages all employees to fully cooperate with the FBI.

The company has retained Michael Levy and his law firm Swidler, Berlin, Shereff, Friedman, to advise any employee regarding this matter and to be present with them during any interviews by government investigators.  If you would like to speak with an attorney, please contact Ned Crady of the Legal Department at 3-4558 or contact Michael Levy's office in Washington, D.C. at 202-295-8414 and they will direct you to him here in Houston.

A memorial service has been planned for Marisa on Oct 13.
It will be held at St. Anthony's Church in West Harrison, NY.
I can get directions to the church if you think anyone in Houston would want
them.

I plan on attending and am happy to house you/others that will be in the
area.

Please spread the word to anyone who you think should know (I dont know many
of her trading friends)and let me know if you are planning on coming.

I am here to help any way possible.

Take good care.

So you are slow to respond.  I don't like it!  Just kidding!  I am about to hit the couch I think.  I cannot stay awake.  You would think that I am turning 88 instead of 28!  My kitty is still sneezing.  I am worried about him.  I can't take him to the vet because he turns into a lion.  It is quite embarressing.  Be nice to your kitty!

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN (1 * $2,500)
=              $2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN     (1 * $2,000)
=         -    $2,000
Net Scan Risk       ($2,500-$2,000)
=              $   500
Spread Rate         (1* $500)
=         +    $   500
Total Requirement
=              $1,000

The inter-commodity spread margins will be $0 between Natural Gas (NG) and
Henry Hub Swap (NN) futures contracts. Spread credits between Henry Hub Swap
futures and all other NYMEX energy products will be the same as the Natural
Gas spread credits.
Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright and spread margins for
the NYMEX Natural Gas (NG) futures contract and the NYMEX Henry Hub Swap
futures contract.

um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.

So, I looked up flights to Afganistan.  Did you know that they have 20 airports?  Given the circumstances, there are no flights going there.  So, I will have to go to Pakistan first.  It will only cost $2028.00.  So, let me know how you would like to pay for it.  Obviously they prefer a credit card.  Wouldn't you rather go there than to New York?  :)

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

Read this & Send it back to me please  
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items  in front of 
him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar 
and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2" 
diameter. 
He then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So 
the professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. 
He shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  
between the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the 
jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. 
The  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  
course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor,  "I 
want you to recognize that this is your life. 
The rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, 
your  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  
you would be nearly destroyed. 
The pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. 
The pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. 
The sand is  everything else. The small stuff. 
If you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for 
the rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time 
on the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things 
that  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical 
in your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There 
will always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and 
fix the disposal. "Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really 
matter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck! 
I hope it works. 
*  May there always be work for your hands to do; 
* May your purse always  hold a coin or two; 
* May the sun always shine on your window pane;  
* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; 
* May the hand of  a friend always be near you; 
* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you. 
* An Irish Blessing  * The Friendship Bracelet  
* O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O">O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O  
* OK, this is what you have to do...Send this to ALL of  your friends!  But 
you HAVE to send this within 1 hour from when  you open it! 
* Now..................Make A wish!!!!!! 
* Are  you wishing??? 
* You should be done by now!!! 
* Last chance!!  
* I hope you made your wish! 
Now then, if you send this to:  
* * 1 person~ your wish will be granted in 1 year 
* * 3 people~ 6  months 
* * 5 people~ 3 months 
* * 6 people~ 1 month 
* * 7  people~ 2 weeks 
* * 8 people~ 1 week 
* * 9 people~ 5 days 
* *  10 people~ 3 days 
* * 12 people~ 2 days 
* * 15 people~ 1 day 
*  * 20 people~ 3 hours 
* AND, if you are my true friend you will send  this back to me within 3 
hours! 
If you delete this after you read  it .. you will have 1 year of bad luck! 
But ... if you send it 2 your  friends ... you will automatically have 3 years 
of good luck!!! :-)  Believe in yourself, know what you want, and make it  
happen!

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

For your radar screen, I'm hearing that New Power Company may want to hedge out exposure today.  I'm unclear if it will be NYMEX, options or pipe options (T'CO) 
Details are sketchy, once I know I'll pass it on

     John,

     Touching grass or other growing things with the club is NOT considered
     grounding it.  When the ground is covered with grass or other ground
     cover, the club is considered grounded if you rest the weight of the
     club on the ground cover.  Practice swings also can touch growing
     objects in the hazard, but not the ground.  If a player were to ground
     his club with several practice swings it is considered only one
     violation of the Rules, not one for every swing.

     I hope this helps.

If a ball is in a water hazard and the player tries to hit the ball out
of the hazard, if he touches any grass that is growing (not the ground),
is that considered grounding your club?  Also, if a practice swing is
taken, and the grass (not the ground) is touched, is that a penalty?
What if more than one practice swing is taken?  Is there a penalty for
each swing?

Thanks.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

You are not going to tell John that you can't make dinner.  You need to go.  I can't stay out that long anyway, but I am planning on leaving early.  Why are you torturing yourself by reading that e-mail?  A tubby?  Is that what you call a bath?  Cute.  It doesn't bother me to talk to you about anything.  You can talk to me anytime.  Studying?  Are you kidding, I just got home and I am not motivated at all.  I think that I am kidding myself about trying to go to school.  I don't want to do anything but sit on the couch.  I have gotten so lazy.  That is why I am going to start playing soccer again in January.  You can make fun of me if you want to.  Cheer up.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

For additional information, visit HGO's web site at www.houstongrandopera.org. Also see volunteer opportunities below.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas

Dear Body Shop Members,
"Healthy Habits for the Holidays" << OLE Object: Microsoft Clip Gallery >> October 22nd - December 14th

Week Five - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   "Take Five"  It takes only 5-minutes to recharge your batteries with renewed energy.
Relax and sit in a comfortable chair.
If possible close your door and your eyes.
Slowly take deep breaths, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
Focus on a beautiful scene, special moment, happy occasion, or warm feeling.
Taking a few of these mini-breaks throughout your day will help you remain focused, calm, cool and collected.
Weight Management:  Fat Free Cookies
Don't be fooled by the term "fat free" on a food label.  While there are a myriad of fat free products on the market today, many of them are loaded with calories and concentrated sugars.  May fat free versions of foods contain only a few less calories per serving then their fatty counterparts.  Five fat free cookies 50 calories each still adds up to a significant caloric intake.  Be a smart shopper.  Compare calorie and fat contents when choosing products and practice moderation when eating high sugar or high fat foods. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Congrats to:  Pete Prelli -Winner of Week Four Massage & Kenneth Mathis - Winner of Week Four Enron Travel Bag

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

The following announcement was released by the NYMEX today regarding
Trade at Settlement for the Heating Oil and Unleaded contracts.

Please call us if there are any questions at 212-841-3333.

Thank You,

BNP Paribas Commodity Futures



> Please be advised that a Pilot Program for Trading at Settlement (TAS) on
> heating oil and unleaded gasoline in the front month was recommended by
> the Locals Advisory Committee today. A proposal will be put before the
> NYMEX Board Wednesday February 6th for ratification.
>
> The basic points are as follows:
> Initial Period: 60 days, March 1 thru April 29 (for the spot months April
> & May respectively)
> Program to be monitored on a daily basis during this time with normal
> review scheduled after 30 days
> Program also subject to immediate suspension should it be viewed as
> harmful to the efficient working of the marketplace, particularly
> regarding the transparency and dependability of the settlement price

So, I looked up flights to Afganistan.  Did you know that they have 20 airports?  Given the circumstances, there are no flights going there.  So, I will have to go to Pakistan first.  It will only cost $2028.00.  So, let me know how you would like to pay for it.  Obviously they prefer a credit card.  Wouldn't you rather go there than to New York?  :)

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

d the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next =
weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet a=
nother trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) w=
ith the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Mi=
dwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to muc=
h above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for m=
ost of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast=
 mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest. =20

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm tod=
ay.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/=
   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "e=
nron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the d=
ay tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm=
 the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlik=
ely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer=
 picture for the East.* =20

John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use=
 252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days.=20

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calenda=
r Days (=3D Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the E=
IMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps.=20

Subject:=09Historical Volatility

Zimin,

I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been calcula=
ting historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of the log=
 returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily volatility) =
and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to come up wi=
th an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I have been u=
sing is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am trying to=
 do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to the im=
plied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied volat=
ilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote and I=
 iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I also =
look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day conv=
ention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a compar=
able historical volatility number I need to use 365.25 to convert the daily=
 historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

Thanks again for your help.

John Griffith

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp.

No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

the other people that were receiving this report no longer want to track this information.  Do you still need to see it?  And if so, how often?
Otherwise, I will discontinue it, and provide information when it is needed.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

Great on this end!  Phoenix Open tomorrow, 1:20 tee time Sat at the 500
Club, taking the boat out Sunday on Canyon Lake.  It's a wild sight to drop
a line, real in rainbow, all within forty feet of Saguaro cactus.

I hear UBS is locking folks in at this point, or at least trying.  What
percentage of existing natgas/power front office will be retained?  I would
assume they'll leave the operation in Houston?

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas

Definitions:

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Bush Adviser Rove Owns Stock in Major U.S. Firms

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show. 
Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform.
Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, "I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings," Mr. Rove said. 
Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside groups, including corporations. 
"He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here," says a White House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House. 
President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms. 
The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, according to a White House aide. 
The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company, the documents show. 
Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is unclear when the transaction went through. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. 
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon Oil Canada Inc. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975. 
The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told reporters. 
The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and Marathon Oil Co. of Houston. 
Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed. 
"The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive," Longwell said. "It's a very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work immediately." 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with more than 15% of the investment cost. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

WASHINGTON INSIGHT
Gloom today, glut tomorrow

A.19
(Copyright 2001)

WHAT GOES UP usually comes down. And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy. 
Imagine the news stories a few years from now: "Crisis hangover -- energy stocks sink as prices plunge; But California consumers still stuck with high bills."
"The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years. 
"The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001. 
"Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap. 
"But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed." 
Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies. 
"To economists, letting the price rise is the solution," said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. "To elected representatives, having the price go up is the problem." 
Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and $400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction. 
As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom "promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say." 
Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was really cheap. 
How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate. 
Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar. 
People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators. 
Low prices discouraged energy development. 
"Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries," Portney said. "You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $2 a BTU." 
As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004. 
Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades. 
"High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will encourage people to make better use of what they've got," said Robert Ebel, director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here we go again."

INDIA: Rating firms may be judging India harshly-analysts.
By Vidya Ranganathan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Analysts have reacted with surprise to last week's decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut India's sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable, and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country. 
Fitch, which rates India's foreign currency obligations at BB-plus, a notch above Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cited concerns about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate.
However, economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies, or a fallout of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems. 
Moody's and S&P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts. 
Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement, but economists said most concerns were exaggerated. 
"When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving, the outlook should not change," said Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd. 
Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode, analysts said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the robust foreign investment the country has been receiving. 
"Enron was a bad deal, made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues," said an economist with a U.S.-based fund. 
Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India. 
Moody's has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999, while S&P has a stable outlook and a BB rating. 
CONCERNS OVERSTATED 
Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past year, since it first rated India. 
Fitch said India's fiscal-monetary mix was unfavorable, real interest rates were high and there was the risk of a debt trap. 
India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 (April-March) to 5.2 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 5.6 percent. 
But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliament's approval, there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined effort at privatising state-run firms has begun. 
Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 percent of GDP is high, but at six percent annual growth, India is one of the fastest expanding economies in Asia. 
"In terms of external liquidity, India is much stronger than its BB+ rating while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian nations," said P.K. Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston, Singapore. 
Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion. 
Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy, and inflation is benign. 
"The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster," CARE's Nagarajan said. 
But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking. 
"What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on those," said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd. 
"We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks have not cleaned up,".

INDIA: India rupee ends off lows, fwds close higher.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - The rupee ended unchanged on Monday, recovering from the day's low after a large European bank sold dollars, dealers said. 
It had slipped to a low of 47.04 per dollar in early deals on dollar purchases by a jewellery importer.
The rupee ended at steady at d47.01/02 per dollar. 
Dealers said there was no impact of Friday's comments from international rating agencies which had raised concerns over continuity of foreign investment and dragged shares lower. 
The currency recovered from lows around 47.085 on Friday, reacting to international rating agency Fitch's revision in the outlook for India's ratings on sovereign debt to negative from stable, citing worries about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. 
Later, rating firms Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) said they were disappointed over the government's reform effort. 
Moody's also raised a concern about India's Maharashtra state utility's ongoing tussle with Houston-based Enron Corp and said: "the dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations". 
It added this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country. 
The comments weighed on bond prices, which extended losses on Monday, and in turn led to paying in dollar forwards. 
"After a long gap, there was corporate paying interest in forwards today," a dealer with a state-run bank said. 
The six-month forward ended at an annualised 5.10 percent compared with Friday's 4.95.

UK: Spectron trades UK's first post-NETA spark spread.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Energy brokerage Spectron said late on Friday it had traded the first brokered gas-electricity arbitrage, or "spark spread", deal in the UK since the launch in March this year of new electricity trading arrangements (NETA). 
"Now that liquidity has returned to the electricity market post NETA, such transactions are expected to become more common...", said Spectron in a statement.
The deal was concluded between UK utility Powergen and U.S. energy group Enron . 
Spectron said the trade, covering winter 2002, was for 60 megawatts of electricity at 21.42 pounds a megawatt hour and for 100,000 therms of gas at 24.85 pence a therm. 
The winter period specified in the deal ran from October 1 to March 31. 
For the electricity, one day was defined as 2300 hours to 2300 hours. 
For the gas, one day was 0600 hours to 0600 hours. 
The deal comes as the industry moves to create standard terms and conditions for spark spreads. 
Powergen is due to meet in mid-June with other traders, including Aquila Energy , for talks aimed at agreeing standard terms. 
"It is hoped that the market will soon establish standardised documentation leading to a standardised product that will help promote liquidity in one or more levels of efficiency," said Spectron.

INDIA: Enron India lenders meet in Singapore on Tuesday.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India. 
Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO , and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate.
Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. 
But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity. 
Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to continue supporting the project. 
But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions. 
The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug, plan to oppose any such move. 
But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output. 
The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. 
Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings. 
The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. 
Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors. 
"The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country," Moody's said. 
India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday. 
"India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected," he said. "There is no need for concern." ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase.
By Clarence Fernandez

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. 
With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts.
"Sanctity of contracts has to be kept," Prabhu said. 
The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 billion. 
Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. 
"Absolutely," he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs. 
"In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in favour of generation," he said. "We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process." 
Prabhu added, "We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made." 
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT 
A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. 
An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government, and whom local media call "technocrats". 
Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort. 
He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a stumbling-block for foreign investment. 
"They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make," Prabhu said, referring to the states. 
SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India. 
India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment. 
But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves. 
RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE 
Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. 
Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector. 
The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment. 
Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report within a few weeks. 
"For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states," he said. 
The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally, he said. 
Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. 
"In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable," he added. 
Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently. 
Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even free, as many did in the past. ($1=47 Indian rupees).

Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for "poor performance"

06/04/2001
BBC Monitoring
Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) BBC

Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled: "Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project"; published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 June 
For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project (IPP) initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago, Enron, the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend [2-3 June].
In his conclusion, Obasanjo accused Enron, a major player in the electricity project, of poor performance and bad faith. Ostensibly angry at the delay in the project's full take-off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme, the president on the American Cable News Network (CNN) declared: "Enron has played a dirty game on us. Dirty game in two ways." 
Beside putting up an exorbitant price, the company according to the president, also failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Continuing, Obasanjo said: "The price at which they (Enron) have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant. Two, what they told us they would do, they have not done." 
While refusing to disclose the firm's charges, Enron Vice-President of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream. "We have a project that is very close to coming on line," he said, stressing that the company's desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact. 
The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago. 
At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption. "The concentration for now is not as private homes, we would soon get there," Tinubu assured. 
The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.

India: India and Bush Administration: Beyond assumptions

06/04/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire

SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with China. 
Mr George Bush's decision to "drop by" the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions.
Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are Christian fundamentalists. 
Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'. 
The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country is "persecuting Christians". And when it does intervene, no Republican administration dares cross it. 
For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations - including trade relations - with that country. 
India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to "elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party". In its latest human rights report, the US State Department noted these acts with concern. 
The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a step away from being branded as a country that "persecutes Christians". 
A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration. 
The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India. 
The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are desperately "searching for an enemy". They appear to have settled on China as "the next enemy". Their next step is to search for "allies" 
who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are "natural allies". But such a decision has an enormous range of long-term consequences for India. 
To discuss just a few: Most of the Indian military's equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them, and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment. Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bush's proposed missile defence programme. But this technology is far from proven, and during the decade over which it may be developed (if it gets past Congress), China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons. These may, primarily, be a deterrent against the US, but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford. 
The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their "closest allies". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system. 
Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences. 
The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term. 
Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry. 
In fact, they were among the biggest "contributors to his campaign". 
The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to "make sure that Enron's interests are not neglected". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are likely to be coloured far more than we think.

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project
2001-06-04 08:41 (New York)

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project

     Mumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned money
to Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try and
persuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3
billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.
    The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groups
of bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss an
escalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron against
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.
     ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the
problem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at Industrial
Development Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggest
lender to the Dabhol project.
     The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in the
offices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international
lenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which have
loaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.
     Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's
decision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengthen
international lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invoke
government guarantees to recover their loans.
     ``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' said
Pradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-
government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eager
to call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percent
cut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenses
while watching the saga linger.''
     Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtra
and federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loans
of about $600 million to the venture.
     IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460
million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in
guarantees.
     Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit of
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston in
April approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its power
supply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling the
project.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.

                             The Fight

     Maharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buying
power from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24
told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchase
contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was set
to pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute over
bills owed by the board.
     ``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did not
expect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are in
dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December and
January. Others bills through March have been paid.
     The board has refused to pay the December and January bills,
saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty
the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full
capacity on Jan. 28.
     The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to
change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitch
said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.
     ``The dispute indicates that India's government may not be
willing to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the Economic
Times quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's Investors
Service, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deter
foreign director investment from coming into the country.''
     Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on the
country's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of
``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch,
rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''



Enron Japan's Hirl on Power Deregulation: Commodity Comment
2001-06-04 06:29 (New York)


     Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive of
Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the
outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke
at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.

On Japanese government policy:
     ``The government does have a strong commitment to
deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''
including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of
energy.
     ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not
much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current
system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's
inevitable.
     ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the
U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400
percent higher than the U.S.
     ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this
large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If
you compare that business with a company that's just like it in
Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year
in the cost of electricity.
     ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult
situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise
in the economy.''

On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in
Japan:
     ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI
(Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it
was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.

     Touching grass or other growing things with the club is NOT considered
     grounding it.  When the ground is covered with grass or other ground
     cover, the club is considered grounded if you rest the weight of the
     club on the ground cover.  Practice swings also can touch growing
     objects in the hazard, but not the ground.  If a player were to ground
     his club with several practice swings it is considered only one
     violation of the Rules, not one for every swing.

     I hope this helps.

If a ball is in a water hazard and the player tries to hit the ball out
of the hazard, if he touches any grass that is growing (not the ground),
is that considered grounding your club?  Also, if a practice swing is
taken, and the grass (not the ground) is touched, is that a penalty?
What if more than one practice swing is taken?  Is there a penalty for
each swing?

Thanks.

I am really not wanting to come back.  We are about to leave Heaven!  I am freaking out!  I take the LSAT Saturday and I have barely studied!  That's another hole in the NY trip.  But at this rate, I think that a vacation to NY and some shopping sounds like a better alternative.  I am starting to get nervous about seeing Kori tomorrow!

Just when you throw in the towel after last week's move reality comes back and
bites you on the butt. Yesterday's action saw funds getting right back into the
short side on flat price, and spreads moved right back to their weakest levels
seen late Thursday. The move back below $19.40 will reassert the short term bear
tone, medium and longer term tone have stayed consistently bearish. I'm still
looking for a move sometime in February towards $14.00, weather is not
cooperating and gasoline imports continue to put a damper on the near term
fundamental window that had opened. Crude spreads are much weaker on Access.
Dampening prospects of economic recovery cannot be helping either. DOE's were
even more bearish than API's.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

I know I've been heavily bearish and saying that a close above $19.40 would get
me back into a neutral tone, but I'm going to stick with even the near term bear
view for one more day. The market is reacting bearishly to what I see as neutral
stats. Distillate demand is high, due to run cuts and exports, but the
fundamental window of opportunity may have passed us by, By that I mean that the
traditional late Q1 rally is usually brought on by run cuts combined with cold
weather. Weather is not cooperating and gasoline has been flowing over here.
Price action for the past three days has been firm, especially the past two with
solid spread action. Still can't get behind the move, fighting it a bit, a
strong settle today has to change the short term bear strategy. I am still
extremely worried about the possibility of Russian oil companies ignoring the
OPEC quota and jumping over themselves to raise hard currency.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd 
Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd 
Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd 
Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd 
Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow, 
The Weather Team

It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

Brian,

As we discussed earlier today, Enron North America Corp. (ENA) desires to re-establish its account with Paribas.  The purpose of this account would be to sell no more than 2,500 NYMEX natural gas futures contracts to hedge natural gas storage inventory for the months of February, March and April, 2002.  Please advise me as soon as possible regarding what ENA will need to do to re-establish its account.  Please call me with questions at (w) 713-853-7657 or (m) 713-582-8379.

Regards,
Ed McMichael
Vice President

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Yesterday's overproduction numbers have lent a bearish tone to things this
morning. Cold weather is too little, too late as we'll get back to above normal
temps by tomorrow. Heat spreads suffered mightily yesterday,as did cracks, as
product fixed two weeks ago will find a home over here again. Some think Feb/Mar
has more bearish potential than Jan/Feb, I don't think so but I also don't think
you ride that horse too long. Hope you all appreciate my down-home metaphor.
With recent movement, you now have to wonder if there's any justification for
any backwardation on the heat c urve, and all we have left is Apr/May. Crude
spread movement, apart from the first two spreads, has been slowly bullish and
that tells me not to be short outright price overall. Dec/Dec now out to +12,
we've now returned to backwardation all across the crude curve apart from the
first two. People now wait for any signs of the Feb/Mar Brent squeeze bleeding
over here. Gas cracks still firm, gas/heat with solid movement yesterday.

So, I looked up flights to Afganistan.  Did you know that they have 20 airports?  Given the circumstances, there are no flights going there.  So, I will have to go to Pakistan first.  It will only cost $2028.00.  So, let me know how you would like to pay for it.  Obviously they prefer a credit card.  Wouldn't you rather go there than to New York?  :)

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Crude is giving a potential sell scenario for Friday.   While the market has been all over the map, I have the possibility of a lower  high on the same daily strength pattern.  March crude saw a recent high of  2037 on 1/28.  A particular daily strength pattern appeared from that  day.  Tomorrow, Friday, should March trade above 1950, the same daily  strength pattern will show up.  A down close for the day is a sell  signal.  I am also getting better hourly strength patterns from Thursday's  late action than what was seen at the 2037 high.  This sets up a bearish  divergence back down and a minimum target back under 1856.  I have an  hourly sell signal once crude takes out the low of the highest hourly bar.   Call if any questions.

Well, let's get back to basics, since timing here on daily moves has been tough.
Are we still mired in a long term downtrend? Have things at least cleaned up a
little over the past two weeks? Is the physical overhang somewhat
counterbalanced by concerns over a widening of military action against other
nations, say Iran/Iraq? If you answered yes to all of these, you're eligible to
read further...

Just some facts:

*The US Northeast is now seeing the coldest temperatures all season, yet heat
cracks lost value yesterday.
*Gas cracks are still holding the $7.00 range, a sign the market is still
willing to give gas season the benefit of the doubt but not much more.
*Russia is still a concern for overproduction. A very soft economy and a desire
for hard currency could easily lead Russian oil companies to cheat the recent
quota.



The technical pattern looks very much like a bearish head and shoulders(see
chart below, I'm referring only to the most recent range between $18 and $22).
At the very least, it implies we will test the neckline again in the next two
weeks. This comes in right at $18.00. A close below would signal thew move
towards $14.00 that looks inevitable for now since the dominant channel is a
downward one. You can also see how we've had difficulty establishing $20.00 as
resistance or support; this is key since it will determine whether the next move
is to $24 or $17.25. Since gas is the seasonal product and gas cracks are still
firm, the range is still dominant. I would expect a close below $18.00 would be
coupled with a move back to or below $6.00 on Q2 gas cracks. But for now, expect
the move back towards $18.00 to get funds shorter again, then also expect the
market to use those new shorts as an upside squeeze play.

Read this & Send it back to me please  
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items  in front of 
him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar 
and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2" 
diameter. 
He then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So 
the professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. 
He shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  
between the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the 
jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. 
The  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  
course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor,  "I 
want you to recognize that this is your life. 
The rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, 
your  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  
you would be nearly destroyed. 
The pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. 
The pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. 
The sand is  everything else. The small stuff. 
If you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for 
the rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time 
on the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things 
that  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical 
in your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There 
will always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and 
fix the disposal. "Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really 
matter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck! 
I hope it works. 
*  May there always be work for your hands to do; 
* May your purse always  hold a coin or two; 
* May the sun always shine on your window pane;  
* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; 
* May the hand of  a friend always be near you; 
* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you. 
* An Irish Blessing  * The Friendship Bracelet  
* O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O">O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O  
* OK, this is what you have to do...Send this to ALL of  your friends!  But 
you HAVE to send this within 1 hour from when  you open it! 
* Now..................Make A wish!!!!!! 
* Are  you wishing??? 
* You should be done by now!!! 
* Last chance!!  
* I hope you made your wish! 
Now then, if you send this to:  
* * 1 person~ your wish will be granted in 1 year 
* * 3 people~ 6  months 
* * 5 people~ 3 months 
* * 6 people~ 1 month 
* * 7  people~ 2 weeks 
* * 8 people~ 1 week 
* * 9 people~ 5 days 
* *  10 people~ 3 days 
* * 12 people~ 2 days 
* * 15 people~ 1 day 
*  * 20 people~ 3 hours 
* AND, if you are my true friend you will send  this back to me within 3 
hours! 
If you delete this after you read  it .. you will have 1 year of bad luck! 
But ... if you send it 2 your  friends ... you will automatically have 3 years 
of good luck!!! :-)  Believe in yourself, know what you want, and make it  
happen!

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Louis,

We are moving on to the 6th floor Trading area in the new building.  I have two financial traders under John Arnold who would like a spot in the garage (not reserved) and have not been offered that choice as of yet.  One is currently in the Allen Center and one is in the Clay Garage.  Please help me out on this if at all possible.  I would really like to make their day.

Their names are Mike Maggi and Andy Zipper.


Many thanks, 

Ina Rangel

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd
Thu	11/22	65 Bcfd
Fri	11/23	65 Bcfd
Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd
Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,

The Weather Team

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Mike,

It was nice to meet you last night.  At PanCanadian, I'm the gas options
trader, where much of my work is focused on clearing stuff for customer
business.  If you have the opportunity, let me know of any new options
products you guys are working on that I might be able to sell to our
producer, pipeline, and LDC customers for hedging.

David Hsu

Well, Thursday turned into quite a "corker" when for most of the day it looked
like nothing would happen. A late run up on products expiry caught the market
off guard and we were able to settle back above the $19.40 mark, which seems now
very unimportant. Believe it or not, we're still in a range, albeit a choppy and
volatile one. Incremental fund positions are getting chopped up. The Access
after market was extremely active and volatile on news reports of a natural gas
pipeline explosion near the Kuwait/Iraq border. We ran up to $20.03 before the
hysteria died down. We then sold back off to $19.09!! In the light of calm, both
are seen as overreactions and we should come in right around unchanged for spot
crude. The worry over the pipeline story wasn't necessarily on a supply
disruption, but the cause of teh explosion. Its proximity to the Iraqi border
raised more wide ranging issues. Heat spreads saw a solid jump up, Mar/Apr into
-10, Apr/May -15, May/June -40. All extended momentum, whether up or down,
appears to have waned. Summer gas cracks are holding on in front of $7.00,
another sign that the downward momentum isn't there right now. OPEC comments
that they would cut production if "other" producers flooded the market (i.ie.
Russia) and a (so far) failed threatened strike by refinery workers in the US
Gulf Coast are also causing some volatility. Good luck today.

So, I looked up flights to Afganistan.  Did you know that they have 20 airports?  Given the circumstances, there are no flights going there.  So, I will have to go to Pakistan first.  It will only cost $2028.00.  So, let me know how you would like to pay for it.  Obviously they prefer a credit card.  Wouldn't you rather go there than to New York?  :)

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Yesterday's run up doesn't, at least at first glance, resemble a major bottom.
Yes, we did make a new low and settle higher, setting the stage for a possible
reversal. To confirm, we need to see a settle above the $19.40 high from
Tuesday. The reason it didn't resemble a major bottom was the lack of solid
spread action. Crude spreads barely budged, even at the highs. If people were
really seeing yesterday as a potential bottom, it should have been reflected in
more nervousness in short crude spreads. The only market that did react
spread-wise was heating oil. Turnarounds and a mildly improving overseas market
have had some effect. Mar/Apr, in particular, has moved in from -50 to flat.
Replacing barrels during turnaround at close to carry makes sense, anything in
premium only makes sense if a squeeze opportunity arises. Given the huge stock
overhang in PADD One and lack of extended cold weather, I don't see this as
viable. Paper players are clearly very short, however, and that has some
bearing. Back on the short spread angle, you could make the case for a lack of
covering until a strong settle was seen. If the majority sees yesterday's settle
as important, we should see a definite crude spread reaction today. A decent
number of out of the money $19 calls were exercised last night, we haven't seen
that play in some time.  Gas demand fell of the table and gas/heat continues to
look soft.

Bank in NY starting an energy desk looking for traders,originators, etc, and
the second is an investment bank building a desk in Houston. Looking for
someone who has run an east or west power or gas desk to be head. Wasn't
sure what your status was. Call me when you have time to speak more in

I am going to have lunch with a client at noon  Friday in the Westheimer and Sam Houston tollway area.  If it would work  out OK for you I thought we could try to play somewhere out 59 South, so you  will be closer to home.  If you can I would like to get some dinner after  we play as well.  I will give you a call after the close this afternoon to  see what you think.

DOE's were seen as more negative than API's and will lead to a slightly more
bearish tone this morning.

Other nuggets on stats:
1) Gasoline demand remains solid.
2) Heating oil days of supply fell to 8 over last year and demand reflected
colder than normal temps in the US.

Anyway, not a huge surprise in the numbers. The large range game should continue
as conflicting geopolitical and fundamental factors cancel each other out and
lead to inaction. OPEC is now reported leaking up to 1mmb/d, Russian
overproduction is still a concern. However, Iran and Iraq may be draw into the
larger military conflict and Iran's current war of words with Israel makes that
seem more immediate.

So, what to do? Well, we're still in a larger downtrend, as stocks and negative
paper spreads make clear. Many are still pinning their hopes on gas season, and
demand is still nicely robust. The key will be blending ability, and the overall
health of the economy. The uncertainty of last year for refiners is largely
removed due to the resolution of the Unocal debacle. That at least gives
refiners and blenders a clear playing field. Now the economy; If chemical, jet
and industrial demand remains soft, refiners won't see competiton for those
blending components. So, we probably will still not see anyone putting all their
cards on the table until the start of March, but my gut says there will be no
problem making summer spec gas and that talk of a huge gas demand season is
largely overblown. Passenger load on airlines now looks to be less than 10%
below pre-Sept 11th levels, and a soft economy doesn't necessarily imply people
will drive to vacations rather than fly, they may just cut back entirely.
Anyway, until the question of gas season is solved we will likely not budge from
the existing, but volatile, $18-$21 range. April-June gas cracks did settle back
at $7.00, but that's not a  big deal given that the range of these over the past
two months is $6-$7.50.

I told you that you were a trouble maker!  :) So if we are going on a weekend, why are you telling Robyn?  And how would I be going for work?  You have a lot of holes in your plan.  Are things better for you at home tonight?  I hope so.  Talk to you later.  Happy Thanksgiving!

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

I'm lost!  I compliment you?  Leaving the in-laws.  Wasn't near as bad as I thought.  Going home to pack and then headed to Dallas.  Maybe I should just stay there for good.  How are things with you?

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to.

I hate to have to say this, but there will be no more Mark Report in the year 2002.  I have decided not to stay on with the new UBS/Enron trading company.  It has been pleasure working with everyone and provided interesting and sometimes humorous commentary on the energy markets.  I hope to continue to stay in touch with some of you, but I will be moving on to a crude trading position at a major oil company here in Houston.  Good luck and keep hedging!

I think that this is what I said:

You better be in a great mood today!  It's turkey eve, it's cold outside and perfect weather for hot chocolate!  Then I started to sing you some song, but I can't remember which one.  It was a christmas song.  and I told you that you were missing out because you have ever heard me sing.  it was dumb, but funny at the time.

Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Natural is now producing hourly "0" bottoming patterns to go  along with the daily and weekly "0" patterns.  If there is anything left on  the downside, it's from here.  A close above 228 today is a good daily buy  signal on my work and should lead to a more sustainable rally.
 
Crude has short-term targets into tomorrow for a low.   Price around 2005 - 2040.  Still looking for a rally to see $23+ into  early-mid Feb.
 
By the way, since my client base has shrunk in the last  couple of months, any suggestions for possible contacts who you think might find  my work useful?  Thanks,

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.
