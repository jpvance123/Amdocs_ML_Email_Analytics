Following up our conversation - 

 - Garrett and Dana are in constant contact re British Energy and have no issues with extending the contract 
 - Paul and his team are "very confident" that they can roll the hedges and maintain the existing margin
 - They are 100% confident that they can hedge all 500MW's at say a $2 margin
 - Their plan is to hedge at least 400MW between now and november (new deals + rollovers)
 - We will continue to update both you and Dana before entering into any hedges

Rebecca and everyone - TGS presentation can be 45 minutes.   On Cuiaba - that can go for 1/2 hour.  Between Transredes, GTB, TBG, and the GAs Unit - can take 45 minutes combined.  If we are adding more time to the agenda - I think a seperate discussion on Petrbras would be useful.  After Jeff hears about wholesale and the assets - it will be clear Petrobras is everywhere.

Gentlemen,

John and I spoke today on the schedule for Jeff's upcoming visit and decided that it may be light relative to time allocated to the asset reviews.  So, we are proposing that Tuesday, all day, be the asset day.  With Elekro slotted for an hour as originally planned, this extends the time for all of the other assets from the allocated 1.5 hours to a much longer time, including time for the heads of those businesses to have discussions with and answer questions from Jeff.  Also, if Elektro was strapped for time in the original allocation, this change leaves some breathing room for a bit more time there as well.

Pete and Orlando,  I would much appreciate a return memo outlining how you propose to spend the day with these changes.

Thanks much,
Rebecca

I booked a flight on Continental to San Francisco.
 
March 15th  - Thursday - I arrive at 4:47.

I think Tych is already in California.  If we can all get there at similar times we can get in our Cadillac and go.

Subject:	BC Hydro Interview 5/21/01

Sources have conducted the following "off-the-record" interview with a BC Hydro executive.  

Executive Summary
BC Hydro projected capacity 
BC Hydro/Liberal Government's export policy
BC Hydro expanded capacity projects

BC Hydro Capacity
The individual stated that BC Hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply British Colombia through 2005, even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion.  He stated that BC Hydro's long-term contracts to supply power to the grid in the Western US amounted to only 1% of BC Hydro's capacity.  Therefore, the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through Powerex, the company's "main revenue generator."  For example, according to a company report, BC Hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $2.876 billion Canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001, largely due to spot market trading.

BC Hydro Exports
BC Hydro feels the new Liberal government likely will "make a concerted effort to expand capacity" in British Colombia. Likewise, since the Liberal government will be "business-oriented," the BC Hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the US.  However, the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point, as "people don't necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export."  This is due to broad-based environmental opposition to building more plants.  Therefore, in the long-term BC Hydro's new projects will favor "green alternatives" such as dam expansion and biomass, thermal and solar plants over gas-fired plants.

The spokesman stated that the Liberal Party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove BC Hydro's monopoly on power.  If and when this happens, relations between the company and the government are expected to "quickly sour."

BC Hydro Capacity Projects
BC Hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand/improve generation capacity, including:
Seven-Mile Dam -- BC Hydro will likely add a 213 MW turbine to the 3 units already in place
Revelstoke Dam -- BC Hydro is "looking very seriously" at adding a 500 MW unit to the 4 units already in place.  There is also the potential to add a 5th 500 MW unit, though this is not being considered at this time.
Site C Dam -- A plan for a 960 MW dam was shelved in the 1980s due to environmental concerns, but now appears to once again be a "viable option." Though BC Hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time, the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980s, and that resurrecting the plan would be a BC Hydro decision.
Burrard Thermal Plant - BC Hydro has invested $250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions.

Calpine has bought a 240 MW gas-fired co-generation plant called Campbell River on Vancouver Island.  This plant is "in the final stages of testing and is already generating."  Calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "in the next few weeks."  BC Hydro will buy power from the plant for use on Vancouver Island. This is part of a plan to make Vancouver Island self-sufficient in electricity.  Another "key plank" in this plan is the Port Alberni plant, a 250 MW, independently-owned plant that is being sold to BC Hydro.  The plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply Vancouver Island.

I'm fine, just wondering about what "data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EOL EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time" means from a practical standpoint and if we are going to have to build something to accomodate this....

I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know 

John

We tried all day to sell this volume below.

However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

Frank,
I think that you are handling it appropriately.  Lavorato and other ENA sr. mgmt should be apprised of the facts and the your opinion of the potential risks and solutions.  After they have made the decision, then we need to make sure that the procedures/processes/ and risk capture are consistent with the business expectations.  Please make sure that the Energy Operations staff is aware of this as well as credit so that they may adjust their behaviour accordingly.
As a house-keeping item, I do not think that it is appropriate for me to be CRO of Bridgeline.  I would nominate you or Vlady.

Subject:	Bridgeline Sleeve


Ted,
A little background regarding this email.  Sometime back a ENA "sleeving" arrangement was set up for Bridgeline, addressing Bridgeline's poor credit rating.   Upon execution with the broker, confirms would be sent to Bridgeline/ENA and ENA/counterparty.  Evidently, a majority of these deals were short term in nature and dealt primary with intramonth gas daily markets.

Today, Bridgeline has a larger budget and is striving to trade larger, consequently the sleeving arrangement is being used more frequently.  I spoke with Brad Horn regarding this and told him that it would be far more appropriate to trade using EOL instead of the sleeving arrangement.  He resisted this idea because of the EOL "haircut", and difficultly getting market data if not transacting in the "real" world.  

This potentially creates a legal issue, as well as may cause ENA to wear unnecessary execution and market risks.  I say this because, at times, in order to execute the trade, Bridgeline has to represent themselves as Enron, and basically tell the broker that the deal is done with so and so on the 32nd floor. (Think of what would happen should the counterparty "walk" on an in-the-money deal because Brad wasn't an authorized trader --admittedly, this hasn't happen and the deal is still sleeved.....  An additional note is that I spoke with Brad regarding the situation and he promised never again to represent himself as an ENA employee.  (He recognized his error...)

I apprised Scott Neal and John Lavorato of the issue and at present it is my understanding that they are working on a solution. I have recommended that either the sleeving arrangement become formalized (written and reviewed by legal) or that transactions be directed through EOL.

Let me know your thoughts.

Frank

Subject:	Bridgeline Sleeve


Vlady,
I spoke with Brad regarding the current situation.  In summary, we agreed that the present relationship between ENA and Bridgeline, allowing deals to be sleeved needs to be formally documented (satisfying legal concerns/issues) and/or trades need to be directed through EOL.  Specifically, directing trades through EOL presents problems for Bridgeline, from wide bid/ask spreads to "stagnant" market information.  (i.e. knowing that El Paso is active in the market helps them better manage/optimize their system)

Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.

I want to move next weekend.  If we can start at 2 PM on Friday it would be fine.

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.


Martin Bucknell

Hi

We are getting in several anylysts and associates  (new hires) in the next few months.  We also have interns coming for summer only.  Do you need any.

Can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits.

I apologize for not responding to your resume request sooner, but after

careful consideration of my future career, I am hesitant to make a career

change at this current time.  I appreciate the fact that Enron North America

gave me the opportunity to discuss the potential for employment with an

executive of the organization.  Unfortunately with the birth of my son, I am

hesitant to make any career change right now.  Based on the aforementioned

and in consideration of the valuable time of the Enron management team, I

would request that we cancel the meeting that has been scheduled for this

Wednesday.

Sincerely,

Edward Reitze

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for rolling/liquidating positions.

First of all - blow me.

Second, my wife is expecting in early November so I might be able to slip away in September.  I would vote for anything that would require one flight from Houston.  I'm sure Rich would agree.  ie.  Timmins would be tough.  I would love to join you all and get mocked for an entire weekend.

As anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.
 
I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.
 
Regardless, our American friends have yet to pony  in, nor has Galea ll, and I want my clams immediately! McConvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer's address below, I do not want you having  access to my home address.
 
On as totally separate note, I'm beginning to now  look past when my son Yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. As such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late September? I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!! Air Canada is  offering $235 flights to Norfolk and Charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!!
 
So the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , I hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you're about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! Are you ready Charles? (" If he's in, I'm OUT!)".  Hey McConvey, are you going live a little outside that Weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere?
 
Let the witchypooing begin. I'll explain that to  you later Lav.

John, first off, congrats on your promotion! 

You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year. 

The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.

Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors. 

The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation. 

We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

Please let me know whether we should proceed in negotiating a lease with TCPL.

Regards
Milnthorp

John-

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Savings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our asset allocations or contribution rules until November 20. This has generated an awful lot of resentment and deep conspiracy theories. Can you ask the Board to offer a remedy to those affected by this?

I am sorry, but I cannot believe what I read below.  

Arch of Chicago - multiply by EXPECTED number of accounts??????
Suiza - How do we measure milk production, we cannot even manage energy consumption - Got Milk?????
Packaged Ice - ??? I hope we don't have any ice facilities in California.

Conclusion - I do not expect that we will do any more deals like this anytime soon.

Subject:	RE: P&L Impact of Volumetric True-Up

The brief synopsis on causality of the losses are as follows:

Arch of Chicago

The deal was originally priced (in 1998) with one account and the results were multiplied by the expected number of accounts.  We have re-priced the deal with actual volumes from our billing system (to capture all active volumes).

Suiza

The revenue is based on a production index (gallons of milk).  We have updated the revenue from the Consumption Desk and re-priced costs with data from our billing database.  In addition, we have worked with the Account Manager to segregate pass-through vs. active volumes.

Packaged Ice

The revenue is based on a production index (bags of ice).  We have updated the revenue with data from the Account Manager and the Consumption Desk.  We have also re-priced costs with data from the our billing system.

Conclusion

The losses are amalgamation of structured vs. actual volume differences, production index revision and initial modelling error.


If I can be of further assistance to you, I can be reached at 3-1902.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Mike Kim

Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

John & Louise -

To follow up on our previous meeting regarding the coal initiative, I've attached a brief description of the approach going forward, including some first-cut proforma results.  Our goal over the next month is to more fully vet the cost and operations numbers in the attached and to nail down probable sites.

In mid-April, after we've more fully vetted the costs, we'll route our detailed proforma.

After reviewing, let me know if you have questions or want to discuss further.

I thought we were hiring 1 person from EBS not two.

William Abler was ranked as a strong director.  I will agree, but I hope the quality is as high as you think.  We are going to get tones of resumes from EES and EBS, if your going to blow all you bullets upfront, make sure your getting great people.

John/Dave, in reviewing the 2001 plan, I have been trying to understand the capital charge portion. In discussions with Laynie East, our Accounting contact, the capital charge represents the cost of capital for investments funded by ENA Houston. 

I have since investigated each of ECC's balance sheet items and each has been funded by ECC - not ENA Houston. Based on this, Laynie is in agreement that the capital charge on the 2001 plan for ECC should be nil.

Please let me know if you are also in agreement or have further questions.

John- I am scheduling time with the hedge funds in the next 2 weeks for a few reasons. 

Either Mar 29/ 30 or Apr 4-6 would be perfect to meet with the 7 funds we are dealing with since I've already set up time for Bill Bradford and Julie Gomez then. When I know your availability, I can make a schedule.

1. Its important these clients meet SR management. I'd like to introduce you to the portfolio managers so they can explain the nature of their business and the potential for Enron (which is great).  Of those we deal with, we are doing 80-100% of their business.  This is predominately gas.. but we are the best situated to do the same in power, weather, coal, crude/products, etc...  They want to understand our structure.. they have not met anyone SR in ENA since Jeff left.

2. We are losing business with new clients everyday because of the credit/legal/backoffice process. I am bringing Bill Bradford around to meet the CFOs and port managers Mar 29 and 30.  We currently have a log jam of clients to get through the credit/legal system. We have one credit analyst working on our names but we share this person with many other groups.. In the 6 months I have been covering these clients, we have only gotten 2 ISDAs signed (and one we had been working on for a year prior to my arrival).  Credit will not allow us to trade without an ISDA even when their are no "credit" issues.... we do not take any exposure to these clients.. we MTM every day and in some cases call for a 5 day VAR on the MTM amount (this is typically how long it takes to get the MTM money in the door).   

The legal side of this process is also extremely slow.. they are excellent once you get them focused on your work  but due to all small number of them... it takes weeks to get to the top of the chain.  These clients have special needs- the deals they do are alocated to many accounts- all these accounts must be set up in our system properly and the deals booked correctly accross all the trading areas.  This is a timely process with a lot of holes at present.

We do not have enough personnel dedicated to this process. On a side note, no ISDAs means that they can also not trade on EOL.  To date, non of these clients have been able to trade on EOL although they are dying to.    

3. Understanding of market fundamentals = New business. These clients deal with us because we understand the energy markets.. we give them superior service.  Having worked at a bank for 6 years, I know what we provide is unique. Julie Gomez is going to give her state of the grid to them individually April4 -6.

Kind Regards,
Caroline

Hi Julie- sorry I've been quiet.. trying to figure out the best way to get your story (state of grid and production study)out to the hedge funds with the least amount of extra work for you.. I've had to scrap the group presentation idea since a few of the funds made it very clear to me that they would not feel comfortable asking questions with their "competitors" in the room.  So much for the easy road..

so this is what I propose.. there are 7 key relationship funds we need to deliver to and have a working question/answer session with.  Most are in the NY area.. we could do all the sessions in our office.. making the funds come into the city.. i think this will be good because if we get them away from the day-to day.. they focus better.. also, we do not have to travel!

I am thinking either April 4,5,6 or 18,19,20  (wed,thurs.fri).  We'll space out the presentations through the days over breakfasts and lunches. When I know you are available, I'll put a schedule together. The hedge fund business is really taking off now.. and your continued support directly contributes to more QUALITY trading relationships and trades.  The feedback we have been getting from the funds is that they think Enron "gets it" in terms of our view of the markets, trading style, fundamental research, and execution.. the banks just are not there... thus they really want to do business with us. In regards to what we are trading... still mostly gas and crude.. but getting close to executing power and weather deals, and possibly coal.

The funds we are currently trading with are:
NY:
1. Tudor (Proprietary, Ospraie)- Ospraie is managed by Dwight Anderson who you have talked to before- they are in our building. The main Tudor office is in Greenwich- we deal with 2 other portfolio managers there..not sure if we need to present there.
2. Catequil- managed by Paul Touradji and Rob Ellis who were at Tiger with Dwight- they are direct competitors to Tudor- Ospraie (same macro philosophy)
3. Global Advisors- managed by Danny Masters- more short-term traders but trade large positions.

NJ:
4. Willowbridge/ Union Spring: managed by Philip Yang... have both program funds and fundamental- will come to office.

Boston:
5. Harvard Endowment Fund- managed by Stu Porter - they will likely come down here.  Macro- relative value.. privately held so do not have to report performance swings (long-term MTM issues)

Greenwich, CT:
6. SAC Capital- many fund managers (similar structure to Tudor)
7. Paloma Partners- have FERC license to market physical power... mostly trade power, weather..

Let me know as soon as possible of your thoughts and availability.

Kind Regards,
Caroline


On below confo..... more for industrial/producers... we (hedge funds) are not taking a role in this presentation.

We still have a counterparties stuck in credit /legal...

SAC Capital (similar to Tudor)
Union Spring (more of a program trader)
Renaissance (pure program trader)

John,

Willian Stuart has spent 3 months preparing the FX products you requested for distribution to our customers in Canada ( the noon day settlement products). As you can see, RAC has rejected approving these products.  We're ready to go.  I'll meet with them this week but will probably need your support.

Thanks,

Hello Guys-

As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  (Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders those are VERY critical seconds).

Regards,

Julie  :-)

John,

Does anyone report to you the EES-CAL positions? As of this morning, that book was screwed up, for example, it included the Nepool positions. Is P&L of $20.5 MM as of 1/30 correct? Also, no VaR is reported on these positions as of this morning.

I am going to try to clean this mess up today.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

John, I'm trying to close these employment contracts this week - you wanted me to talk to Chad. Can you give me some parameters on s/b and equity.

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks,

With the severe draught in Oregon my guess is PGE is shorter than 500MW this year. You may
want to ask Stan Horton about their status.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris

Barry,

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

Thought you would be interested to know that Dynegy does not have a confirm group.  They do not send confirms.  They just receive them from us.  I guess that they wait for settlement to catch issues over there.  That seems fairly risky.

Please do ask Lavo about spending the money on this optionality (to develop a site with intention to sell not build).  We would do it for a 520 MW combined cycle and for the mobile units in  the Toronto region.  I'd like to either move forward or kill this, now that I have the resources lined up.  Thanks.

I've been approached by a couple of loads in Montana totalling 50-75 MWs.  Zufferli and I did some rough math on the costs of transmission and what our implied offer would be and haven't heard back from the counterparties.  I think that you need more critical mass to make a project work.

Subject:	Extension of Petro-Canada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for 5 more years

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.


The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

Subject:	Split PPA

Gents,

I thought that I would let you know that Rob Hemstock informed me last night that Murray Smith (Minister of Energy) got the PPA Division Regulation through Cabinet yesterday.  This essentially allows us to split the PPA with the remaining steps being a formality.  The Sundance B PPA will become the Sundance B3 and Sundance B4 PPAs within the next week.

I wonder with Joe Sutton gone if they can cancel the worldwide Analyst and =
Associate PRC.  It take a lot of time away from our people and we are ranki=

Subject:=09Final Associate/Analyst 2000 PRC - Jacoby

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below ar=
e the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts=
) and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is =
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduc=
t a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The pre-ra=
tings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and avail=
able for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a secondar=
y supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts feedba=
ck.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or Associates/An=
alysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  The Associa=
te and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the completed =
feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system is closed=
.  The more information that you can secure regarding your Associates/Analy=
sts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated correctly at the final=
 PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are unsure of the process, p=
lease contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or Shelly Butler at x3-4584=
 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the Associates/Anal=
ysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate this feedback in=
cluding your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at your business =
unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not conducting a pre-rat=
ing meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the rating you provide =
is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  Please contact the P=
EP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at x3-5230 if you are unab=
le to load this data yourself.  You should wait to provide feedback to your=
 Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have been made to avoid any =
confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final cross-calibration and =
may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are responsible for contacting th=
e PRC Representative listed above whom will be representing your Associates=
/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind that the more information y=
ou can provide, either verbal or written, will ensure that the final PRC is=
 a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received=
 your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received th=
is, please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the sys=
tem and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how=
 many people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving you=
r reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of revi=
ewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will also=
 be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the opportunit=
y to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you have added =
value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may hear from yo=
ur PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do not, we s=
uggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing. =20

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 20=
00 at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and Anal=
ysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be communicate=
d to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be communicated to th=
e Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the Associates/Analysts have not rece=
ived feedback by the deadline, they should contact their Career Development=
 Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for=
 your cooperation and we look forward to a successful final PRC

Subject:	John, I need your help

Dave Gallagher (our head of Continental Gas Trading) and Andy Fairley (gas trader in the UK) will be in Houston on Feb 12-14.  Can you please help them set up meetings with your commercial gas desks and the gas originators so they can learn from your guys on a number of fronts including:

I think your teams will be interested in what is happening over here in Gas as well.  Last year really saw the business take off.  We now have about 50 counterparties and are doing about 30 transactions a day in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and even an occasional deal in France.  Perhaps they could have separate meetings with you, the West Desk,  Texas Desk,  East Desk,  MidContinent Desk,  John Arnold,  Janet Dietrich, Fred Lagrosta's group,  Julie Gomez and any other ideas you have.

Basis Trading
?	How are the books structured
?	How do the various desks lay off the delta (mid or bid/offer, size parameters)
?	How the options are traded; understand the basis vol curve
?	Are there any clever originated structures that we can copy?

EOL 
?	Do the non-NYMEX locations move with fixed basis and what technology is employed
?	Setting the stack
?	Do they auction any virtual storage or pipeline capacity; an example of contracts

Back office
?	Is there a future for their deal entry system in Europe
?	Are they planning any electronic confirmation and billing system to hang off the end of 		EOL.
?	Are there any reports/ parts of the DPR that we need to have in EEL?

Their schedules are wide open so perhaps you could assign a lead to work with them to get the most out of this trip.    Thanks in advance for your help and time.

John:

I have a friend, Matt Whittaker,  that has a small power plant construction company.  They specialise in fast track projects using used turbines.  A small niche, but he has made some decent money doing it.  He asked me a few days ago if Enron would have any interest in a very small 35-40 MW project in California for a cement plant.  According to him, the cement plant is owned by Hanson plc and they have a site that has been permitted by the local air quality board for a used turbine that he has located and can have up and running by summer.  What he says they want is someone like Enron to develop the inside the fence plant and help them capture any upside from a potential expansion of the facility. (apparently the site is capable of supporting a larger facility, but that requires further permitting.)

I have done no independent verification of this and it may not be real, but thought you might be interested.  If so, Matt can be reached at 713-660-7171 office or 713-823-7222 cell.  Have whoever calls reference me.  If you are not interested, just let me know and I will tell him its of no interest.  If someone calls, please ask them to drop me an email so I can act like I know who they are if Matt brings it up.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

Jim Hughes

Subject:	PGE

Enron has negotiated a sale of PGE to Sierra Pacific Resources for $2.07 B
that has to take place by May 5th, 2001.

Sierra Pacific owns and operates power and gas utilities and pipelines in
the Western United States. Sierra Pacific (SPR) has a market cap of $0.92
B, trading at $11.85, down about 40% off the high of $19.44 in September of
2000. Sierra Pacific has earnings-per-share of <$0.85> and pays dividends
of $1.00 per share. Sierra owns generation assets and serves load in
Oregon and Nevada. Additionally, the Company serves a small load in Reno,
CA (~40,000 customers), which makes it subject to the regulations coming
out of CA crisis.

In order to pay Enron for PGE, the company has to sell its existing
generation assets, subject to regulatory approval from the respective
state PUCs. Given Sierra's financial situation and CA regulation
precluding load-serving entities from selling their generation assets, there
is a possibility that the transaction will not take place by 5/5/01.

Enron Development Group is the most optimistic in thinking that the sale
might still happen by 5/5/01. Enron Gov. Affairs experts expect the
transaction to be postponed by 6-12 months. PGE CFO and Head of Marketing
speculate that the sale may not happen for a long time or ever.

In the meantime, CA crisis has generally slowed down the deregulation
process in the state of Oregon. The earlier expectation that certain PGE
customers may be able to shop for alternate suppliers of electricity,
effective 10/1//01 is in question. This uncertainty makes it difficult to
estimate PGE's load going forward.

As of 2/9/01, PGE positions and risk (including generation capacity, load
and marketing positions) are as follows:

Power	VaR of $19.3 MM	2001:	Long 1,934,031 Mwhs
				2002:	Short 540,122 Mwhs
Gas	VaR of $0.8 MM	2001:	Short 1.4 Bcf
				2002:	Short 7.4 Bcf
Total VaR of $19.2 MM.

Next Steps

- continue to assess the possibility of transaction falling through or the
potential transaction date
- communicate to Enron Treasury the possibility of not collecting the
proceeds on sale this year
- monitor PGE positions weekly (VaR and positions)
- periodically assess the definitions of PGE load and generation
availability
- any other thoughts

Vlady.

Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.

Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.

John,
I am ok with Gorte being on the board of Mariner.  I agree that he is
reasonable.  He and I have always been able to work out differences of
opinion.  I will get with Teresa to work out the process.

The A&A program are running a "magnificent Monday" April 30th to intervier 26 Analysts (summer start dates).    Therefore a number of interviewers have been requested.

Monday am:				20 Interviewers
Monday pm:				8 Interviewers

Can you advise if you or a manager/director in your group can faciliate.     No doubt, those that take the time to interview will have first "dips" on the analysts who get offered.

Thanks,

Karen.

We should have room on 6.  Check and see if Arnold has redone the floor plan.  You need to keep this away from Fred's group.  I would suggest locating near Gas Structuring.  Ed McMichael, the head of gas structuring can be a big help.

John -

What are your thought s on location of EES' Gas desk - current head count = 47.  FYI, we just assigned Jim Homco to this group to address commercial and operational issues.

Is there any space on 6 with ENA's Gas desk?  We have had discussions lately re: the many areas where potential integration efficiencies could be achieved, such as having a retail fixed price rep sit on Lagrosta's desk to achieve more timely and accurate prices for non-swap products.

We could fit the group on 5, but the functional benefit just isn't there.

Also, does Sally Beck's group provide the confirms/contract/risk services for ENA's gas desk as it does for ENA Power?  If so, shouldn't Sally be involved in retail?  These guys are really behind in this respect and it is a big factor in ongoing losses and commercial imperfections.

I couldn't meet with Joon due to PG&E on Friday.  His resume looks good and assuming everyone else likes him, we should hire him.  I assume that this is for associate or is it for associate in the trading tract.  Let me know.  Make sure we get a 3 month evergreen non compete.

Before I agree on anything I will talk to all of you.  Some of the meeting that are happening may be a little premature.

John,

I am interested in a power options trading position at Enron.  I have a track
record of profitable options trading and market-making in illiquid markets,
and have also worked closely with Origination groups to design and evaluate
structured products for customers.  I attach my resume for your review and

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap

   



Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

--Stinson

Of course I agree.

Not playing any hockey and it's killing me.

Hopefully I'll see you next time.

John, 
Sorry I missed you on your recent visit to SAC.  I hope the visit was rewarding and offers good potential.  Gavin has told me about your meteoric rise to the upper echelon of one of the US's fastest growing and profitable companies...good stuff.  Congrats on your successes, and stay in touch with us, because this place is growing at warpspeed as well.
Funny, I was thinking about how much trouble and discouragement we both had in getting sales and trading jobs out of Kellogg.  Guess Goldman, et. al., weren't too bright after all.
Are you still playing hockey? 
Jim

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five.

Wes

With respect to the PPA reserve.

We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.

Subject:	EXTRINSIC VALUE WORKSHEET

John Lavorato expressed concern last week that we may be falling into the same trap again regarding the extrinsic value in our transportation books.  I prepared a spreadsheet summarizing the EXTRINSIC VALUE ONLY (in total and $/MMBtu) that were in each of the books as of 12/5/00, 1/2/01 and 2/1/01.  Hopefully this will provide you with the information necessary to determine if this is, in fact, happening    Please note the following facts::

CENTRAL:
* The NB Ventura to Chicago capacity's extrinsic value has increased signficantly both in total dollars and in $/MMBtu.  This may need review.  
* Note that, although the ANR & NGPL capacities to Consumers have decreased in total dollar extrinsic value, the $/MMBtu value is very high.  This may need review.
* The new capacity--NGPL Midcon to Chicago has an extremely high $/MMBtu value--$.2227/MMBtu.  This may need review.

* The West added two new deals--the extrinsic value is so minimal there is no impact here.
* There were 3 capacity deals that, in December, had no extrinsic value--they have all increased in value but they appear to be properly valued now.
* The PGT capacity was sold, obviously showing no extrinsic value any longer.
* The EPNG Perm to Valero capacity decreased in value, both in total extrinsic dollars and $/MMBtu.

EAST:
* All capacity from Rayne to Leach decreased in total extrinsic dollar value, but the $/MMBtu increased on all except the longest term Rayne to Leach deal.
* All capacity from Onshore to Rayne increased in total dollar value, both in total and $/MMBtu.
       The net impact of these two changes was a net increase of approximately $267,000, but $/MMBtu mostly saw net increases.  
* A new transaction on Tennessee accounted for the other $266,000 in extrinsic dollar value increase.

Subject:	TDC Energy

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through this.

-  It doesn't need to hit the dpr.
-  Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's
-  If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem 
-  Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat. He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.  We're not trying to build Stat Oil here.
-  If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.

Having said all that.  If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.

We are in the initial stages of developing a commercial outsourcing proposal for Total, CMS and Reliant Energy in Argentina. I will be in Houston next week and wanted to get a down load on the most applicable outsourcing structures that have been concluded or that Enron has experience with. Could you let me know who would be the appropriate person to get in touch with. 

The Total transaction is the most comprehensive and would involve management of the power commodity, gas commodity, gas capacity and operations and scheduling as being envisioned now.



Please let me know your thoughts.

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five.

Fred Mitro and I just got off the phone with Duncan Croasdale at Enron Canada regarding the 11N1s. He indicated that, although nothing has been signed yet, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.

Duncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada's books for US$38 million, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.

I am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Booth in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending GE7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these units. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them. We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly.

Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.

I just noticed this.  I would support Gorte.  He is a reasonable guy despite what you guys think of RAC.  Can we do this in conjunction with Rick.

I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, Rick

This could be very dangerous.  

OPG controls all the megawatts.  

They could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.  If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months.

John, it appears that the government is looking for some assurances that prices will not spike this winter and/or they are short MW's  if they open the market November 1st. What are your thoughts on Enron underwriting some type of insurance for the government for the months of Nov, Dec, Jan - ie. possibly writing a call option for 2000 MW at some price that doesnt alarm the govt. 

I could approach OPG this week when I'm in Toronto and feel them out on the two companies finding a solution to the government's concern.

This is also something we may want Lay to offer to the Premier when he is in Toronto.

Benefits would be:

The government may feel obigated to go forward if they have paid a premium for the call starting nov 1(ie binding/firm contract)
We could potentially book a significant origination amount
We would work with OPG vs against - good for overall relationship
Solidifies our relationship with the Ontario Government (ie providing solutions to their problems)

Subject:	Week in Review


Breaking News: US is bombing Iraq on Friday. Crude is up $0.35 , Gas is up $0.06, after hours.
ENE is down to $75-76 in the last few days (allegedly, Fortune Magazine is coming out with a negative article on Enron)
Gas VaR limit is $76 MM until 2/22 ($61 MM thereafter), Power VaR limit is $54 MM.

Gas

Weekly P&L - $79 MM (of which $87 MM is on the West Desk)
VaR as of 2/15 - $55 MM (mostly West and Financial Desks)

Two large down moves on Nymex of about $0.50 during the week, the curve flattened significantly and the 01 strip moves in-tact now, for the most part. Socal prices increased substantially to ~$25-30 for Feb and ~$14-15 for Mar.

Most traders have flattened their books, except for the following two trades:

- West Desk is long Socal Feb/Mar (Feb @ ~$25 and Mar @~$9.50). There is a great deal of bullish sentiments: PG&E hit the "90% rule", San Onofre plant   may stay off-line for quite some time and the 6-10 day forecast calls for Much Below weather in So. California.
- Financial Desk is preserving the Oct-01 length. Arnold argues that the end of the season is the best contract to hold - it moves up with the front on up moves and holds value on the down moves (I think he is right). He did a good job of hedging around this position.

Deals:	closed KCS Energy VPP deal on 2/16 - adds about 4,000 contracts of HH gas for 2001-2006 and about $4 MM of incremental VaR to the floor.

East Power

Weekly P&L - <$4.6> MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $22 MM (down from $35 MM)

The desk took off a lot of positions on Thursday ("chopped a lot of wood") - Presto wants to stay flexible and mobile, and have the opportunity to go either way (long or short) if market conditions change.

Deals:	unwinding Dayton P&L  for $13 MM cash, short 100 MWs of 4-hour calls (a hairy deal, out-of-the money ~$15 MM)
	submitting an indicative bid on 2/16 to TNMP for a full-requirements power deal in Ercot

West Power

Weekly P&L - $44 MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $22 MM (down from $35 MM)

The desk has been taking off some of their length in CA. Most of the risk on the desk comes from Long positions in Cal 03/04 and the Longs in 01. The outlook in the West is bullish, consistent with the gas story.

Deals:	negotiating a monetization with Avista ~$66 MM) - Enron delivers 25 MWs @ MidC 3/01-2/02 and receives 83 MWs 2/02-12/03 from Avista

Canada

Weekly P&L - $2 MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $20 MM

Southern Cone

Weekly P&L - $1.7 MM (new deals)
VaR as of 2/15 - $2 MM (increased from $0.3 MM)

Deals: 	executed 2 external deals with Gerasul and CGN Energia: bought 500,000 Mwhs for Cal 01/02.

EES

Reduced VaR from $12 MM to just over  $5 MM this week - taking off length in the West in 01 and further out. 

PS. Honored to have had the opportunity to manage you book last week - great learning experience. Also, makes me appreciate more the job of all the guys on the desk.

Vlady.

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

Subject:	Extension of Petro-Canada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for 5 more years

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.


The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

Subject:	Potential Gas System Exposure

For some period of time, various West Power desks have been the default desk which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in TAGG.  I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West Power out of this problem.  I'm happy with the result from the West Power point of view.  

I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists.  If someone does a gas deal and hasn't set up a new book properly and doesn't carefully track his/her position, the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages.  Days, weeks, or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain.  I think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before -- not the gas desk with the misplaced trade.  Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of his/her position is missing.

These are the facts as I understand them.  I'm sure that Stacey White, Steve Nat, and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Tim,

Steve has described the problem accurately.  Setting up a dummy book solves the problem for us, but not for Enron as a whole.  If no one monitors the dummy book on the daily basis (which probably won't happen if there is no ownership), then you still have the possibility of positions falling into that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended.  Why can't a process be put in place for the initial set-up of a book in TAGG?

Subject:	RE: Remaining problem with West tot


Tim,  The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the 'interface' job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results tables.  If mapping logic is not set up for a new book, the job was defaulting the gas deals to the ST-PLT desk.  The default mapping has been changed to a dummy  ZZ_erms book, which will prevent the deals from showing up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.

In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on that front.  

The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this option.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Steve

The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower; therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to another book.

Tim,

Sorry about this.  A better question to ask is why are systems people manipulating data?  Why can't the users put on a reversing trade?  I'm having fits about IT resources touching production data and I can't tell you how many times we screw ourselves up because IT does this. 

I'll let you know the end result.  Sorry again, but these practices have to stop!

words cannot describe how distressing this problem is.  in terms of mis-reporting our risk, we are dropping mmbtu's from some other book into our book as mwhs.  mmbtus go for around $10.  mwhs go for around $400.  why is this problem so hard to fix?

Please note that as of 2/13 there will still be 1,321 MWhs of Nymex Swap position in ST-PLT book (COB) which is yet to be cleared out by IT.   I have sent out an email to Norman Lee in IT and will follow up with him to make sure this problem is removed asap.  (The "unknown" position of the -311,354 MWhs showing up on 2/12 has already been taken cared of.)

What's your view. Should we consider doing something more for Todd? I think Jeff would like to pay him or grant him some more equity. I am on the fence. When I mentioned it to Deliainey a week or two ago he said no then said I should discuss with you.

With regard to Todd Busby - some clarification.  His total bonus was $75,000 - of which he appears to have decided to take 20% in equity.  The last numbers I heard before bonuses went final were a total bonus of $100K consisting of $75K in cash and $25K in equity.  This $100K bonus was agreed to without the knowledge that his contract called for $150K if he was in the top two groups.

The above is really just to remind you to continue reflecting on whether it would be feasible to do anything for Todd.

Dear John,
 
You do not know me, but I got your contact details  from Bruce Angus who I know from Kellogg as we both graduated in  1994.
 
The reason for this email is that I am very  interested in working in a management or business development position at Enron  Broadband Services in London. At the moment a headhunter is supposedly setting  up an appointment with Enron for me, but I believe it would be extremely useful  to approach you as well to speed up the process. Therefore I would really appreciate it if you could forward my details to  one of your colleagues in the US or the UK.
 
For your information please note that if you have a  look at my CV, you will see that my last two jobs were quite short. When I  joined eos internet ventures I knew I was taking a substantial risk, but  believed there was an opportunity due to the strong management, but  unfortunately we were not able to raise 2nd round funding. United Internet AG is  a German publicly traded company with 3000 employees and revenues of Euro 200  million. The Board decided to change the international strategy during my first  month of employment and offered me the temporary job (but minimum of 9 months)  of Head of Investor Relations for United Internet AG in Germany. I declined as I  was hired as MD in the UK and not Head of IR in Germany. In addition, I am  (still) happily married so I didn't want to travel between the 2 countries  for such a long time.
 
Anyway, it would be fantastic if you could help me  in any way and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or  let me know if and when I can contact you.
 
Best wishes,
 
Eylard Wurpel

Now that we sent the first blow, lets get everyone together to discuss our future steps.  Next week is a nighmare but perhaps you could set  up a conference call sometime Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  

Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.

No I haven't sold anymore.  Given your concern about the selling gas beyond Cal 10, I bought back the Cal 11-15 piece on Friday.  I made $0.12 on it.  Derek is working on selling 50 MW to Powerex for 10 years out of 02 and we have 10 MW of customer deal for 5 years out of May 01 that is close to closing.  I will update this spreadsheet as changes occur.

Comanche Proj indicates he is out looking 

I can give you details - assume they are a small shop and would therefore miss him ?

FYI Folks-

The Kern River expansion that we backed out of (the 15 year stuff) is going to be 900,000 MMBtu/d.  As you can see a large number of the shippers stayed in the process, and are now bound to the pipe if it gets built!!

There will be a press release on this tomorrow...

Julie  :-)

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Wes

I'm away Monday and Tuesday in Brazil.  I thought I would give you things that I'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week.

1.  Your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 3 formats.

2.  On South America - Lot's of stuff but we'll talk when I get back.  Most importantly that I get an income statement that looks like North America.

		-  They did a trade with me that's up 8 Million for them. This is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in N.A.  The positive p/l was showing up in South America. (We should make sure this trade does not get cash settled.  The last thing I want is Cash going to S.A. on an internal trade.

		
3.  Cross Commodity Book. - I have 1.9 Million of losses that were last year that they found in January.  Put this in the TBG line and change the line name to Other .  In the Footnotes we will explain all others.  I'm sure there is a million things to come.

4.  We also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me.

5.  I've set up a meeting with you,me,Deffner and Louise on this 15% capital charge.  We should come up with another methodology.

That's all I can think of now.

John

Joe, you should come clean on this one - you know what the understanding was ...... At  least for the North American piece maybe not EE&CC.

John, take a look at the DASH - I think I wrote several comments.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

Hi John,
Attached is the marks we are using to mark our books as of Nov 15th.  Please
have your guys drop in your marks for the same day and send back to us.  This
should clear up 90% of our differences.
In addition, your help on some 3rd party book outs would help us reduce our
overall position size. We were working on one with Williams, when Kevin Presto
objected unless he was able to earn the bid/offer.  We would like to do the
following:

MS sells to Enron
Enron sells to Williams
Williams sells to MS

----100 mw of "Into SOCO" all at the current markt price.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
                Joe Delaney

David,
Per my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is currently looking for additional Director level Analyst PRC Representatives.  The breakdown that is needed is as follows:

1 - Enron Americas
1 - EIM
2 - EGM

Your previous nominations made at the end of the year will be used which will helps to reduce the number of Analysts for each Representative to ten.  However, we need more Representatives.  Again, we are looking for the Directors that are considered to be the up and comers in these business units.  The Analysts that will depend on them need to know that they are people who are willing to take on this responsibility and represent them fairly.  

We would like to have your new nominations by March 1st so we may begin communicating to the new Analyst PRC Representative Board.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks so much.

We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new endeavors.

Hi John,
Attached is the marks we are using to mark our books as of Nov 15th.  Please
have your guys drop in your marks for the same day and send back to us.  This
should clear up 90% of our differences.
In addition, your help on some 3rd party book outs would help us reduce our
overall position size. We were working on one with Williams, when Kevin Presto
objected unless he was able to earn the bid/offer.  We would like to do the
following:

MS sells to Enron
Enron sells to Williams
Williams sells to MS

----100 mw of "Into SOCO" all at the current markt price.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
                Joe Delaney

I'm talking to Dave about Hughes reporting to Sally.
They don't need to even check the bill.  They can have a customer service g=

John -

FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting a=
nything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group th=
at is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our rec=
onciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk A=
nalysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes=
).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade S=
tubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconcilia=
tion.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the "Cust=
omer Touch" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our g=
etting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly=
 reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.  I think EES needs to be =
given an ultimatum to 1) either provide us with a Settlements function that=
 allows us to flash and reconcile or 2) get out of the way.  We can provide=
 them with the bill and they can lick it.

Rogers,

I'll wait for Mike's response, but these should all be forward volume adjus=
tments as a result of truing up the volumes based on actual data received. =
 The past activity difference is captured in our potential flash to actual =
adjustment that we have pegged at a rough $75MM right now.  One of the diff=
iculties we have in reconciling flash to actual is the difference in actual=
 volumes versus volumes liquidated from the books/batch models.  With respe=
ct to how much more exists, this is one of the key items, I think, that the=
 Project Phoenix team will want to get from Evan Hughes' group to get the f=
orecasted volumes right.  My suspicion is that we need volumetric true-ups =
on many of our deals.

Again, let's verify the above with what Mike's response is.

Recession, What Recession.

Barton Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and Donna want to join us feel free.  

The next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.  Let me know your thoughts.

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.

Stinson

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  Please change that if you can.

The Enron Corp. Board of Directors is meeting today and tomorrow. If approved (very likely), the proposed limit changes will become effective tomorrow, Feb-13th:
						Current				Proposed
NA Natural Gas					$60 MM				$61 MM*
NA Power					$50 MM				$54 MM**

* NA Natural Gas limit will also include all positions in the EES and Cross-commodity portfolios. As of 2/9, EES Gas VaR was $0.1 MM and Cross-commodity Gas VaR was $1.4 MM.

** NA Power limit will also include all positions in the EES and Cross-commodity portfolios. As of 2/9, EES Power VaR was $ MM and Cross-commodity Power VaR was $0.2 MM.

Also, $10 Million of Discretionary VaR is currently allocated to NA Natural Gas. Again, if limit changes are approved, additional $5 MM of Discretionary VaR will be allocated to Gas:

						Current				Proposed
NA Natural Gas	with Discretionary VaR		$70 MM				$76 MM*

As of 2/9, Gas VaR was $73.5 MM and Power VaR was $36.4 MM.

If you have any questions, feel free to call me (x36954). Vlady.

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

Regards

John

Dave Gallagher (our head of Continental Gas Trading) and Andy Fairley (gas trader in the UK) will be in Houston on Feb 12-14.  Can you please help them set up meetings with your commercial gas desks and the gas originators so they can learn from your guys on a number of fronts including:

I think your teams will be interested in what is happening over here in Gas as well.  Last year really saw the business take off.  We now have about 50 counterparties and are doing about 30 transactions a day in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and even an occasional deal in France.  Perhaps they could have separate meetings with you, the West Desk,  Texas Desk,  East Desk,  MidContinent Desk,  John Arnold,  Janet Dietrich, Fred Lagrosta's group,  Julie Gomez and any other ideas you have.

Basis Trading
?	How are the books structured
?	How do the various desks lay off the delta (mid or bid/offer, size parameters)
?	How the options are traded; understand the basis vol curve
?	Are there any clever originated structures that we can copy?

EOL 
?	Do the non-NYMEX locations move with fixed basis and what technology is employed
?	Setting the stack
?	Do they auction any virtual storage or pipeline capacity; an example of contracts

Back office
?	Is there a future for their deal entry system in Europe
?	Are they planning any electronic confirmation and billing system to hang off the end of 		EOL.
?	Are there any reports/ parts of the DPR that we need to have in EEL?

Their schedules are wide open so perhaps you could assign a lead to work with them to get the most out of this trip.    Thanks in advance for your help and time.

5 day or 7 day for hub cash

The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?

Greg,

1.  We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.

2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. 

3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.

I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.

Can you guys please have all your curves set by 3:00 Calgary Time.  As well as Kathy, a lot of Houston bookrunners are having late hours due to the lack of discipline in setting Canadian curves.

We need to hedge funds.

Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. (???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
 
Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.

I met with Shea in Houston.  Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.  He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.  Until recently I was happy with Lambie.  Call me.  We should think about it.

John, TCGS turned in another dismal performance last year losing C$150MM. Word on the street is that bonuses (payable later this mo.) are going to be zero or close to zero. Supposedly, Shea's group was the only P&L that made money. Timing maybe good to approach Shea once again.

What are your thoughts on moving McKay to Houston, and me going after Shea et al to run ECC's gas trading - Jury is still out on Lambie, and Disturnal is a non-starter. 

Let me know what you think and  I will proceed accordingly.

At the end of the term of each simulation do we assume that we close the position on that date and take a hit or do we leave the simulation with an open positon.

The number of trades doesn't seem to match between your presentation and the spreadsheet data.  The spreadsheet shows 17 power trades this year and your presentation shows almost that many every month.  Same comment for the gas side.

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.

Just talked to Shapiro.  He wants Lay, Alex and me in the meeting.  I of course was fighting Alex.  I'm okay with Lay meeting other people while he is in town.  Shapiro said he would get Alex working on the talking points.  You and Devries should spend time on them before they come to me.

John, we are confirmed with both the Premier's office and Lay for the 19th of June. I assume that you will be attending also. What are your thoughts on who should attend the Harris meeting and what other meetings should we set up to maximize the use of yours/Lay's time.

Brian Purchase is a key decision maker in Wilson's office. My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase. Aleck believes that it would be beneficial for Lay to meet with them also.

Rob, we have Lay from about 1 pm to 6 pm.  The question is how to make the best use of his time.   After the Premier, I think  meeting Wilson and Purchase is  the best use of his time.  It is really Purchase I want Lay to meet, and it would be hard for Lay to meet Purchase without including Wilson (assuming of course he is available).  They will be among the key decision makers going forward.   If you have any other suggestions about how to make the best use of Lay's time here, please let me know.

Aleck, I wouldn't have Lay meet with Wilson and/or Purchase but definitely Lavo could meet with them.

Lay is confirmed for the 19th.  We have him from one  to about  six.   Once I have the Premier's meeting tied down re time, I am going to try to arrange a meeting for Lay and Lavo with  Wilson and Purchase.  I think that is the best use of his time.  Let me know if you have any other or different ideas.

After a great deal of work the Canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with PetroCanada for another 5 years.  This was a great accomplishment for Enron Canada.  The Logistics, Accounting and Commercial execution over the last 3 and 1/2 years played a key role in extending this deal.

Subject:	Extension of Petro-Canada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for 5 more years

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.


The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.

i am 95 percent certain that the power financial volumes are really power index transactions.  when we do an index transaction enpower splits it into a financial swap and a physical transaction.  if you look at the pattern it perfectly mirrors our index transactions.  volumes began to increase in april of 1998 when the california market opened and we had a large volume of sales to ees at a px index price.  volumes grew as ees' load grew.  then ees began to hedge themselves and buy index from others, so we saw a steady decline in the index volumes.  last april we had a large number of index sales which accounts for that blip.  now the index market is dead and the volumes reflect this.

the physical volumes are right on.  they perfectly match the data that we use here.

To add an element of fun to tonight's hockey,  whomever is going against Brad should "team up" and make a concerted effort to  NOT allow him to carry the puck over the blue line. If two or three guys "rush"  him, he will be forced to "dish the puck" off to a teammate, which he HATES to  do on a rush. He is not happy unless he either shoots or makes a sleek,  goal-mouth pass. His natural arrogance will force him to try to beat all those  who challenge him. If you check him or he makes a bad pass, he gets furious and  is LOTS of fun to watch.
 
I, for one, am changing teams tonight just to do  this . If I succeed only once, it will have been well worth it!

FYI, 

It looks like Ontario may be delaying the opening of the markets.  I am not sure whether this will be more than the expected delay to a fall opening.  Apparently, some of the media are speculating that it will be delayed until after the next election which is likely in 2003.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

John, 

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

We are also making sure that there will be no adverse tax impact for Enron.

Please let me know if you agree to close these positions.

Remi

I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per on the road working on it.  We probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless New Albany is enough.

That sounds reasonable, however, I am looking at taking a different tract (ie.  going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company).  This has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 2 weeks.  I will keep you posted.

This is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.

No to be overly defensive, but in very liquid markets (ie PJM, Cinergy and Entergy) the EOL bid/offer is 2.5-3.5%.  In the west MidC, NP,SP, the bid offer is 3-4.5%.  In a market it which I am 95% of the trades with no liquidity without me, my EOL bid offer is 4-5%.  I think the is very reasonable, if I felt that being tighter would allow more trades without me either being the repository of unwanted MW or being the only supplier of MW, then I would be tighter.

Obviously not a priority, but some of the trading track guys are carrying $1,000,000 V@R overnight on the premise that a $10,000 penalty isn't going to hurt them if the market is down $.10.  Should we remedy this?

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?

Our Copel shares are falling in value.  We have never marked this investment even though it is public.  We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.  We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.  At the current price we would lose 15 to 30 Million.

Copel is trading at $6.70, down over $1.00 from Thursday close. The rumor is that this is the aftershock of a 7 MM block trade last week.

I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
 
Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

As you would say.  There is good news and bad news.
 
The good - we got the dining room chair.
 
The bad - it was an end/arm chair not a side chair.  Specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms.
 
Good Luck

Hey Chris;

The property with the party room facing the Gardiner (not Gardener dumb ass)
has already garnered me offers worth $120,000 more than I paid for my suite,
which means I could use just my profit portion to purchase the property next
to yours! I wouldn't live there though, as I have a red Rumplestiltsken like
acquaintance whose looking to move into a neighborhood where he can "feel
comfortable." The $200 monthly rent I'd get would come in handy in my
philanthropic endeavors in helping rid the world of Red Scourge Disease,
which is deadly when left unchecked and unabated.

Keep 'em coming pal, you serve them up and we'll keep knockin' them out!

Take care Red mate.

You will get stopped out.  I talked to David Port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var.  However, until its fixed I have no choice but to use the reported numbers.

Subject:	West VAR

the numbers being generated for the west's var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be.  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations.  for example, the ltnw book has a grant total of <3,000> MWh from now through September On-Peak and 194,000 MWh from now through September Off-Peak.  the var report shows mike with $20 million of var -- about $16 million of it coming between now and september.  we have a total var of $30 million, with about $20 million between now and september.  by my rough calculations, we would have to have the entire curve move roughly $100/MWh in one day for this var to be accurate.  that means that once every 20 days the entire summer curve -- peak and off-peak -- would have to move in excess of $100/MWh.  i might add that we are short q4 which i'm not giving us any credit for as an offset. 

i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books.  i just don't think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out.  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery.  we see the same thing with option valuations.  we see option model valuations (e.g., transmission spread options) going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality.  similarly, the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches.

bottom line.  i need to know what you want us to do.  we are chewing up a lot of var.  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now.  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn't necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the "model" happy.

After a great deal of work the Canadian team has renewed our outsourcing arrangement with PetroCanada for another 5 years.  This was a great accomplishment for Enron Canada.  The Logistics, Accounting and Commercial execution over the last 3 and 1/2 years played a key role in extending this deal.

Subject:	Extension of Petro-Canada Wholesale Gas Services Arrangement for 5 more years

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.


The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

John,
I heard that the traders are required to put together supporting documentation for large trades, outlining fundamentals and market assumptions.  Is this true? And if possible, any chance I could review the files?  I'm thinking we/RAC can add value by perhaps "balancing" out analysis and maybe even suggest a way to optimize the process by periodically backtesting analytical assumptions.  (e.g. Are we making money because are analysis was correct, or are there "new" features driving the market.)

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

01/22 12:52 UPDATE 1-Enron distances itself from Calif. power crisis 

HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Energy powerhouse Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday distanced itself from California's power crisis, saying the turmoil which has brought the state's two largest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy would not impact its bottom line. 

"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," Jeff Skilling, the president and chief operating officer of North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said in a conference call with analysts. 
Skilling also said there hadn't been any significant impact on fourth quarter earnings, noting that Enron did not own electricity generation assets in California, where rolling electricity blackouts were imposed last week and the state's top two utilities are running out of money as they face soaring wholesale electricity costs. 

Having sold electricity to the state's main utilities, generating companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. <REI.N> and Dynegy Corp. <DYN.N> are now at risk of not receiving payments from Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International <EIX.N>. 

At the same time, some have claimed that power generators have taken advantage of the crisis by over-charging the state's utilities, which, as part of deregulation, cannot pass on skyrocketing electricity prices to consumers. 

"California is a much smaller percentage of our overall earnings than some of the other energy companies, particularly generators," Skilling said, adding that the company only participates in the merchant business of buying and selling electricity. 

"The bottom line is this: We are not overexposed in California or anywhere else for that matter." 
Shares of Enron rose $2-3/8 to $73-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after it reported earnings before nonrecurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million in the fourth quarter.

Presto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.  Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.  It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.  If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.

CDWR is not positioning itself to buy new power assets.  Whether or not they buy the output from Pastoria, the plan would be for us to sell the project this year.  Calpine is the high bid and they are open to the project having a California toll on it.   We believe that the proposed pricing of the power sale to CDWR would be attractive to other power plant buyers as well as Calpine. Our current obstacle relates to water - Azurix breached their water deal with the project so we are "fixing" it by dealing directly with a backup water supplier.

Gentlemen:

I have spoken with CDWR several times since we submitted our proposal.  They are immediately interested in a 5 year power sale and then want to discuss Pastoria.  I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year ($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start trading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow, but so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear from them again later today.  I will keep you posted.

Regards,

Chris

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase - not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
	- clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
	- urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the "world" to the CA utilities
	- remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

	- Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and 	  EES will assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM, 	  in exchange for Avista and MS exposures.
	- PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable from 	  PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
	- addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
	- overall increase in prices
	- incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

Vlady.

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.

We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved one year trade with their subsidiary Savannah Foods in April 2000.  In hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

FYI, Imperial Holly Corporation filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday.  Counterparties affected would be:

		Holly Sugar Corporation


At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.

I'm going to get on Ken Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).  I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.  I'm concerned that hoards of people from Houston will show up and that it will be a cluster.  Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.  Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my Ken meeting.  Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized.

We executed the transmission connection contract with Light (local distribution company) yesterday for the project.  Based on completing this agreement and our conversation, we are moving forward with the shipment of the turbines.  Initial loading of loose items will start this afternoon and turbines tomorrow with a planned departure of the ship on Sunday.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments?

Thanks,

Can you settle this guy down.  As well as always whining about his fake trading account, he wants to accellerate out of real time early.  Tell him to do his time and learn.  Also he wanted to go to Harry's group next which is a mistake. He needs to learn the business not the derivatives.

hi Kam,

This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!

Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.


Thank you.


Punit.


P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere.

First, congrats on buying a great house for free.  Need to put up a fence in the back because Bob is a pain and somehow convinced me to take done the fence.  We never did figure out the combo for the back door.

My thoughts are the same.  You should stay in Canterra.  We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.  Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.

John, I want to re-confirm your approval to enter into a new lease. We need to give notice to Canterra by end of June on whether we are extending for an additional 3 years to June 2005 or terminating our lease June 2002. 

I'm currently negotiating on 3 different sites as well as discussing the extension with Oxford:

Canterra		3 year lease - no renewal rights - $26sq/ft at 20,000 sq. ft. No ability to expand contiguously. Currently, at capacity.

TCPL Tower		Conoco has 3 floors (26,27,28 at 25,000 sq.ft/floor). With Gulf takeover, they will consolidate into Gulf Square. Looking for 3 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft 10 year lease w/renewal rights. Good floor-plate (column-free rectangle). One floor would likely be 			adequate for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Bankers Hall		Calpine has 2 floors (39,40 at 19,000 sq.ft/floor). With Encal takeover, they will consolidate into Canada Trust. Looking for 2 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft. 10 year lease w/renewal rights. One floor would be less than adequate - 2 floors would be more 				than we need for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Phillips Warehouse	2 floor warehouse being converted to 3 floor office bldg. 10 year lease w/renewal rights on 35,000 sq.ft at $20sq/ft. Will build to suit and 			Enron would have building naming rights. Timing with expiry of Canterra lease is good (Occupy date would be 1st qtr, 2002). 

My preference is to target the Phillip's brothers warehouse.Timing, location, price, sq.footage, parking all look good. They are willing to deal with us exclusively and have aspirations of designing a state-of-the-art office building (this is consistent with their reputation) while Calpine/Conoco want to free-option us while they look for multi-floor tenants (much like what happened when we made an offer on TCPL tower previously and they used it to lever Hunt Oil into a mulit-floor lease).  

Let me know your thoughts on this as I need to move fairly quickly.

John, first off, congrats on your promotion! 

You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year. 

The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.

Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors. 

The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation. 

We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

Please let me know whether we should proceed in negotiating a lease with TCPL.

Regards
Milnthorp

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.

Regards

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Subject:	Re: TGS Booking

John, Joe,

We are ready to book the TGS capacity for the next 13 months (April 01-April 02 included) - rationale of the 13 months: winter season starts in May.

We chose a conservative approach to book all capacity that was not sold yet against our monthly demand payments.

As of today, impact is a loss of $2.5 million.

However Rolo closed successfully the Profertil transaction (13 month, sale of 175,000 cm/d delivered in Bahia Blanca).  Contract is apparently already signed by counterparty and will reach our office in BA by Monday (they already nominated April 1st gas).  When we book this transaction, TGS capacity position drops to a loss of $700K only.

For the sake of earnings stability, I therefore recommend that we postpone the booking of TGS position until Monday when we get the Profertil contract in hand.  The following will happen:

TGS Transport: loss of $700K plus reversal of Jan-Mar losses on TGS ($800K loss will be moved from Gas trading to TGS transport).
Gas trading Profertil: gain $160K (approximately)
Gas trading Chevron (to supply commodity to Profertil): gain of $100K approximately.

We negotiate with Camuzzi to sell them the optionality (15 day interruptibility) that we obtained from Profertil.
We are left with some summer excess capacity that we will try to sell a best price.

Let me know if you agree with my timetable.

Remi

Remi,

We need to decide how and when to book the TGS FT Capacity. If we only book the current deals we have (5 P customers, Renault and Bagley), the MTM Book loss will be $2.5MM (booking 13 months - starting April 1st, 2001 thorugh April 30th, 2002).

If we decide to book Profertil, then the MTM Book loss will be $700K (instead of the $2.5MM). Additionally, we still have 15 days of optionality in the Profertil contract that we have not booked and could be valued at approximately $250K depending on how the negotiations I am carrying out with Camuzzi (LDC) end. 

Chevron will also add another $100K to the MTM book.

Keep in mind that the YTD gas book is ~$800K down due to the TGS demand charges during Jan, Feb and March.

Please advise on what and how you want us to book these different deals (keep in mind in mind Q1, Q2,....).

Tks,

Rolo

I was intending to take Mitch Taylor, manager of Intel's  fab plant in Hillsboro, Oregon who has been extremely useful to Enron in helping to understand the memory business.  The memory trading group has used him extensively as a resource to get them started (Michael Moulton and others) - they support taking him to the Masters.  Please give me a call if you have questions or concerns.  Thanks.  Wayne.

We absolutely should do this.

We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.

There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.

PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp

Brooklyn Union

Peoples - Laura Luce

Enerconnect - Devries

My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.

Louisiana Pacific has sent me a letter requesting that John Malowney cover all of their energy needs in North America.  John has done an excellent job building this customer relationship to the point that they want to bring him into their energy management team.  This would include both gas and power, I think throughout North America.  I have never received a request like this and am not sure how to handle it.  John would like to do this, and would be willing to take the risk on committing extra time to LP in hopes of more deal flow.  Since this relationship would be broader than just West Power, I am looking for direction from you whether and how we should proceed internally.  Part of me says that it will be a big headache and time sink for which we will never get paid.  The other part of me says that this is exactly where we want to be with our customers and if they want John to represent them, then Enron needs to find a way to make it happen.  Let me know your thoughts.

Jeanie,

Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.

This looks good especially if you get Harris.  What do they want me to be part of if anything.  I was assuming the Breakfast and the Lunch and hopefully the meeting with Harris. Can you let me know so I can set up my schedule. I would like to go see the Toronto office and also get some personal time in.

Per your request this fall for updated Ontario Supply and Demand information, this email is confirmation that OPG has agreed to release updated transitional 2000 market data.   Once this data is posted to the IMO website, I will forward you a complete & updated Ontario Supply and Demand report (as my last report was not complete due to OPGs previous refusal to update the data they provide to the IMO).

Alec:

Sorry for the delay in responding to your request for updates to the
information that OPG provided through the IMO's Transitional Information
Team process. After considering the merits of your request, and in the
interests of fostering continued good relations, we have decided to update
the Transitional Team information with relevant year 2000 data.

In order to be fair to all market participants, we propose giving the
updated information to the IMO and asking them to update their Website. We
have approached the IMO in this regard and the preliminary indications are
that they are willing to do this.

As you recall the Transition Information Team process resulted in the
release of approximately 43 different types of reports (I have attached a
list of these reports below). Generally, the reports fall into four
categories: (1) reports produced by the IMO released with our consent or the
consent of other parties as appropriate (i.e. Hydro One), (2)
information/reports produced by OPG, (3) information/ reports produced by
others, (4) one-off information items that would not be updated. In terms of
the specific information to be released,  I have highlighted in gray on the
attached chart the reports that we are planning on releasing and the reports
that we will work with the IMO to get released.

We are currently working with people inside the company and the IMO to
gather the information needed for the proposed information release. I will
advise you shortly on how this is progressing. Please call if you wish to
discuss.

Rogers,

The only other detail that I have is that it is a FIRM delivery, full requirements contract, and the monthly volume fluctuated from 7,000 MMBtu to a monthly high of 32,000 MMBtu.  The P&G Plant is located in Lima, Ohio on the West Ohio Gas, a local distribution company.

I don't have much more detail as the user information at EnergyGateway.com is confidential.  But we know that ENA was the lowest bidder and that EES/EWS was the second lowest bidder.  

There may be an overlap of responsibilities here where we could help out and consolidate these retail positions.  

Jess

Jess -

Can you provide some more detail here. 

John, I have always been told that the East desk did not wnat to consolidate the scheduling of retail with wholesale due to all of the balancing risks associated with load like this.  I am ok with them bidding on load, but I think this is a sign that we should begin consolidating scheduling functions under wholesale - I think this would be most efficient.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

John,
I've been asked to set up a primary power desk contact for sleeving South American power.  I spoke with Presto and he mentioned that he has no interest in sleeving anything for South America.   The proposed structure is that North America Power would sleeve deals for South America.  Deal structure would have two legs, North America/external counterparty and North America/Enron South America.  (all transacted through EOL)

Let me know your thoughts.  

Frank

Mr. Lavorato:
 
I was given your name by Brian Edgeworth as a  possible contact for employment opportunities with Enron.  I was part of  Goldman Sachs C$ fixed income effort for four (4) years.  Goldman recently  decided to exit this business entirely.  I was involved in a  trading/capital markets role in both C$ corporate bonds and securitized  products.  I am interested in Enron because I believe it to be one of the  "smarter"  organizations out there.  I am flexible in terms of  location.  I have attached a copy of my resume for your  perusal.
 
I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.   I can be reached either via the phone number below or by replying to this  email.  I will attempt to contact you in the next couple  of days to confirm your receipt of this email.
 
Regards,
 
Robert Downer

There seems to be a lot of folks at Enron involved with Sithe.  Currently Donahue and Detmering are the most senior people negotiating with them.  Start with them and ask who should we contact and who should do it from our side.  Let me know if you need me to call.

I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.

Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the futures trades.

John,

We will have a substantial multi-year C$ short when our mill closes.  We're looking at about C$100mm in 01 and $300/yr thereafter.  I understand ENA may have an opposite position.  Could we discuss this? or would you refer me to one of your myriad of underlings?  I would like to keep EGM out of our pockets if possible.

He is interested talking further.  We will probably need to meet with him during the evening.  Please let me know if I need to do

I have been requesting that the Canadian gas reports be broken down by trader for a while.  I am not comfortable not knowing the P/L or positions by trader in Canada.  Why is this not done yet and how can I help get it done.

John--
Assuming you get the o.k. on the work arrangement we discussed yesterday........

As a follow up to our discussions, particularly concerning working the second half of the day once each week, here is what I would propose:  Instead of working 4 half days in the morning and one half day in the afternoon/evening, I would work 3 half days in the morning (8-1) and one full day.  This way I would be available to meet with Geoff in the afternoon once each week.

Please let me know if this works and if the arrangement in general is acceptable to HR, Louise, etc.  Thanks.

Subject:	Avoidable Overtime Hours

We have had 100 percent turnover in our risk group in the last 9 months, including two people leaving in the last week.  One of the main frustrations comes from many overtime hours spent working through technology issues.  

Last Friday is a typical example.  The three members of our risk group were here until about 10 PM Friday night working through a problem caused by Technology.  For some reason, our Futures position was dropping out of our positions.  They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.

It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.  What do you think we can do to change this situation?

Hey John,

Greg Johnston was recently given a copy of the Settlement, Assignment and Assumption Agreement Number 3 between Enron Canada Corp., PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation and Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership which you signed on ECC's behalf as of January 25, 2001.  In order to avoid having to recirculate the agreement, I have amended the attached resignation to be effective as of January 31, 2001.

Unless you anticipate signing more agreements on behalf of ECC, please sign the attached document and have Kim return the original to me for the minute book.  

Thanks,

Mark

John,

Here is the calculation of the 487,856.

The taxable benefit from the option was 537,672 - 153,174 = 384,498.

We then allocated a portion of the benefit to work days in Canada between
the grant date of August 11, 1997 and the exercise date November 30, 2000.
The ratio of Canadian days to total worked out to be 645/755.

We then calculated the Canadian portion (645/755 * 384,498) which was
328,478.
Then converted it to Canadian dollars (1.4852 * 328,478) which equaled
487,856.

Hopefully this explanation answers your question.

Given the size of the stakes, I could definately justify their time.

You simply can't negotiate on a choice market.  Are your owed past fees for management? Let me know.  I don't run industrial markets and Greg would have to settle this dispute.  You would lose.

I think it is going to be difficult for us to convince you that we should take out Houston's share of PML at $11MM when it is not centre of the fairway for ECC (or ENA for that matter). However, at the same time, I don't want to take a hit to earnings given the amount of work that we have put into this thing - legal, board representation, and divestiture efforts.

I think taking me out at my cost ($12.35MM) is a reasonable proposition.

the framework re the sithe letter:
1.added cross default to master netting agreement.
2.added acceleration of ena's payment obligations in the event of default by enron parties under the master and close-out by the dynegy parties.
3.added set off right to dynegy parties if they end up owing under the master to the remaining payment obligations of ena.

re the master netting agreement which you will send:
1. added cross default to ena's payment obligations under the sithe letter.
2. added set off right to dynegy parties like in 3. above.

- No significant change in margin or hotlist summary

Las Vegas:  Allegheny, Black Hills, Northland Power are on dealbench reviewing data, info memo and purchase and sale agreement.  
Process: review docs and data, visit site, negotiate purchase and sale - still on track for June 30 signing and August 31 funding.

Roseville: Exercised option for $6MM of ERC's from Georgia Pacific.  Working on development agreement and initial CEC application.

AMPS: Last week received complete emissions data on units.  Pursuing deals to install, sell or lease first 2 units.  Most likely structure: Site owner contributes site and pays 20% of costs and get 20% of margin associated with selling energy into merchant market.  Currently in discussion with 6 industrials and 8 utilities.  Oregon Steel is in the lead - they are spending $ on permitting and engineering at their site in Portland (unfortunately the site is near my house so I may protest!).

Blue Dog: $3.5MM of income recognition for turbine sale has moved to Q2 from Q3.

Tolls to Generators: Reliant did not lift our 100MW Mid-C offer. but they are still working on it - they had VAR constraints.  We are also showing synthetic tolls to other generators that expressed interest in our LV toll:  Duke, Constellation, Cinergy, NRG, Dynegy and Allegheny.  While these companies lead with assets, they also have trading functions that seem willing to get long through a PPA.

DWR: Still working through credit and financial info.  Their bid is still there and in the money, but has fallen $2-$3/MWh due to the falling prices in the west.

Subject:	Just in case I go into labour - these are my current thoughts on El Paso

Prepared in contemplation of litigation -  Attorney Client Privilege

There appears to be no succinct way to write down my thoughts on where we are with El Paso but I'm going to try.  

Assumption:
Kilgore's objective:		Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap.
Outcome of lawsuit:	 	Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his 					ratios and revolver.

What do we want?
(i) 	To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position 		whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances 	of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes.
(ii) 	To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts 		without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much 		smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book? 	We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of 'true sale' treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other 		ways we can ensure this is off our credit.

If we sue them?  Loss of leverage.
We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore's accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for.

Way Forward:
We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York.  

Good Luck!

Sorry it took so long to respond.  I talked to our EOL guys and they keep this stuff very close to their vest.  People are talking to us about buying the code but this would cost tens of millions of dollars.

So I don't think I can help.

John,

I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.

EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:

Mining
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Fertilizer Industry
Rail Transportation

In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added

In discussions with the different regions:

ENA should add: 
Refining 
Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
Meat Processing - Luce
Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)


Let me know if there is anything else I should do.

Chris

Dear Mr. Metts: 
  I am contacting you on behalf of the First American Management Enterprises and the Fort Berthold Development Corp. 
  We have the opportunity to aquire a contract to supply to the US Government, a large quantity of Natural Gas, Electricity, Propane,  Lubes and Fuels.  We feel that because of the size of this contract, it would require our company to obtain the assistance of a large company, such as Enron for this supply.  It will be nationwide and could reach a dollar amount of 2 billion per year and extend to possibly 10 years or longer.  We are now in the process of applications and acquiring more information.

  If this is something you feel Enron can help us with please contact us.  Thank you. 
  The contacts are as follows:  Bob Dennis- (701)575-8470

(natural gas, crude, heat, gasoline, weather, precip, coal, power, forex (list currency), etc..)

John,

Attached is a memo sent to me by Mr. Fabac, who works for Thomson CSF and reports to one of my best friends in France.  These guys are responsible for 9 Thomson plants in the world and would like to revise their strategy in power and gas supply.  They would consider a global agreement, or an agreement restricted to a lower number of plants.  They have 3 plants in the US, 1 in Mexico, 4 in Europe (France, Italy, Poland) and one in Asia (China?).  Their global average consumption of power is about 90 MW;  Gas and power consumption (and billing) for 2000 are detailed in the attached spreadsheet.

I suspect that we are intersted in this business opportunity.  Would you be kind enough to pass on this message to somebody who could take care of this (potentially) new account, or at least recommend a name to whom I could sent this information?

Can we possibly get the right to kill the deal 6 months from now if they do not get some credit support.  We may not exercise the option anyway, however, it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free.

I think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units.  I think this is a waste of time.  We can include them in our business unit PRC's for Managers and Directors.

I would be grateful if you could you go into the PEP system and approve my reviewers manually, so that they receive my request for a review early in the week.

Is there any stopping you! (But I'm guessing your not getting out running much any more.)  I really appreciated it when you called me at home on my recent promotion, but thought you might just get pissed of if I phoned you at home (maybe not).  Anyway, I won't bug you at home tonight, and I will congratulate you here.  Very impressive, well deserved.  The realignment involving both you and Delainey should be great for the company.  Push the stock.  Peter.

Barton Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and Donna want to join us feel free.  

The next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.  Let me know your thoughts.

John,
I haven't spoken to you in a while and trust that your off to another strong year and that your family is well settled in Houston.  As you may have heard, I have spent the last year in Japan with Global Mkts trying to help kickstart an fx and interest rate trading operation that would tie this region into our global operation. 

Something has arisen personally and wanted to ask you in confidence of any potential opportunities that you may be aware of in Canada for a trading and/or origination role, perhaps in the next 2-5 months time.  My wife is keen to relocate near her family in Montreal, and so ideally I am wondering if you are aware of any needs that Rob Milnthorp, David Delainey, or yourself may have in that area, be it in metals, power, gas etc. I am aware of a satellite metals office in Montreal under a Director named Jean Michaud, as well as the recent Quebec City paper mill acquisition but am not aware of any other activities which we are involved with in that region. 

Thanks for your time, John

Sincerely,
Darren

I gave you his resume 3 months ago.   I am sending another copy upstairs today.   He would be a manager level hire.   No, he is not the ex-metals trader.

I would like to hire this guy ASAP.

Despite my veto eBiz decided to publish something on California energy prices.  I think Palmer overrulled me.  He said that the article was harmless but I still think it is stupid for us to be writing articles about this.

Chris,

We will not be able to publish a preliminary DPR or position report for 10/31.  Port Calc has suffered a serious code crash, and the numbers generated are erroneous.  Our IT support will be working through the night to repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will be able to rerun an official book.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,
Monica Lande

The transfer of the Arcor plant and the assignment of the 6 Arcor PPAs are now official.  Therefore, next week, we will:

1.  Book the 6 Arcor contracts on the MTM book (Argentina power)

2.  Review with Vlady the best way to record the EPEC contract and the power plant spread option.

This is to inform that we received yesterday a hard copy of Resolution SE N? 4, that transfers the Generation License for Modesto Maranzana Power Plant from Arcor to us.

We have already talked with technical people at CAMMESA, and they told us that with this Resolution, they will accept (starting in April) the contract signed between ESA and ECEA to back up the PPAs that ECEA has signed with some Arcor's industrial plants.

I especially want to highlight the support that Mario Aguilar Benitez gave to the regulatory team to get this Resolution signed.

This is bizzare.  Global Markets promised Jean this money and won't seem to write her a check.  It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.

I once again asked about the committee.  I think Skilling, Delainey and Kean set up the committee and I'm told that there are going to be no changes.

You and I will need to go over your Vice Presidents prior to the meeting.

Subject:	VP PRC Participation

John,

Any word on whether I will get to participate in the Enron wide VP PRC?  As you know I served on the committee in past years and would like to continue to do so.  When you and Jeff Skilling were here in March, Miguel Padron and I raised this issue and Jeff acknowledged a need to consider my request.  You mentioned that you did not really have input into the list's composition and needed to figure it all out as well.

The kick off of the mid year PRC triggered my memory of this issue.

Thanks,

Kish

They are working quite a complex tax structure in Canada.  I'm not sure wha=

Just to follow up from our meeting yesterday morning, the total present val=

termined interest rate to be charged in connection with the EIM financing).=
  The benefit will be realized by EIM Canada and Enron Canada Corp. through=
 a reduction in the amount of taxes paid by each company.  The risk related=
 to the transaction is that the interest deductions from the transaction ar=

offset by such denied interest deduction.  I will forward to you a calculat=

ance as soon as I confirm with our Canadian counsel the method by which suc=
h interest charge is calculated, and the likely rate at which it would be i=

documents) stemming from the transaction is that Revenue Canada could asser=

 the highest level of comfort on this point possible from our Canadian coun=

Subject:	delainey discussions

highlights of my discussion with dave:
he wants an "opportunity" to originate out of the ees positions.  for example, the harrah's deal generated approximately $16 million relative to the mid, of which $4 went to ees.  he wants a chance to back this deal with his sourcing group.
he was unable to offer any definition around what the word "opportunity" means.  one interpretation of "opportunity" is that they get a head start, say three months to back a deal where neither west mm or west orig works on that deal for three months.  another interpretation is that west mm and west orig aren't allowed to talk to certain wholesale customers, for example the generators.  both of these are bad ideas.
i asked him why enron would want to keep its most talented origination resources on the sidelines for any period of time in order to let the kid brother (ees) have a "fair" chance at winning a deal.  i also asked him if he thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have developed in the west.  his answer was no.
i told dave that as the manager of the retail risk book i don't care who originates out of the transaction.  my thinking is that i give a copy of the harrah's contract to calger, foster, and delainey.  whoever gets us out first gets paid orig.  if people want to coordinate then that's fine.  if they want to compete head to head then that's fine.  speaking for portland, i would expect that west mm and orig would coordinate.
dave then said that he "gave" us the risk function and insinuated that we owed him something in return.  i indicated that i was willing to give it back and return to my simple life managing the west wholesale trading desk if that's what he wanted.  i think he took offense to that comment.
we hung up with no resolution.  dave called me back and proposed that we let anyone originate out of the position.  however, the origination dollars would go to ees profit center with the west mm or origination person getting the credit for that.  he talked about ees and the stock price and the billion dollar business.  my guys (i'm not speaking for chris here) don't care where the origination dollars go to so long as they get paid for bringing value.
i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for direction from you.

i'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward.  i would say that we agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals.  i would rather that the money for orig stay with whoever originated it.  i can live with a variety of outcomes.  i'll sit tight and wait for direction from you.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John

John--
Assuming you get the o.k. on the work arrangement we discussed yesterday........

As a follow up to our discussions, particularly concerning working the second half of the day once each week, here is what I would propose:  Instead of working 4 half days in the morning and one half day in the afternoon/evening, I would work 3 half days in the morning (8-1) and one full day.  This way I would be available to meet with Geoff in the afternoon once each week.

Please let me know if this works and if the arrangement in general is acceptable to HR, Louise, etc.  Thanks.

We get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for PAN NAT.  Although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to Duke that they had no support for their position.  We would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers.  
As we understand it arbitration starts July 1.  I'll talk to you more next week.  If you want an update prior call Richard Sanders.

Friday is the day when we are supposed to close the Alamac sale to AIG Highstar.  Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following.    Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund).

We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no return.  As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through Joe.  We are not in the business of doing work for this fund.

Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.  I recognize that contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you think differently and I hope you are right.  My view is that we need to get out as we have no control over their investments.  I have spoken to Brian Stanley on this fund and Brian is (unless someone in his group has a reason not to)  happy to follow whatever approach we take particularly as EE&CC is no longer a EPC company.

Pursuant to you commercial hiring policy, I am seeking your approval to hire Robert Downer as manager  (C $125K) working for Disturnal. I understand that you did a telephone interview with him. He has a genuine interest in leaving Goldman Sachs and moving to Calgary.

We would have him back up disturnal (JD's in kemo for the next 3 months and may not be able to work) and help with structuring derivative products. In addition, we need more bodies in trading - particularly if Lambie is shown the door.

fyi.... Stephane has agreed to move back to Calgary for May 1. I plan to give him a lump sum payment of C$10K for him agreeing to do this. He didnt ask for this but I think it is the right thing to do.

Please advise.

I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely well respected in this field.

Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 

If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,

Michael Fuss

John, I read the Bloomberg note [or whatever they call it] that was on their
news site this a.m. Do they have a bee in their bonnet over Enron or what?
That is about as negative, if not personal, an article as one could want.
Normally when a company embarks on an expanded path to better use its
internal capabilities the market will first take a look at the recent
performance in making a case for its own judgement. Bloomberg seems to want
to ongnore your recent performance. After all one does not embark on any
vertical or horizonbtal expansion after a bad year, but when it can afford
the capital and time to do so before real results are generated.

So there. I did not like the article, nor the trone of it.

By the way did you like the dceg first quarter results?

Your Uncle Frank

Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I wonder if some of our other piplelines are members.

A winner found north of border: Canadian firm cashes in on California ills

By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 4, 2001)

VANCOUVER, British Columbia  --  The room doesn't look like much: a bank of computer screens flickering quietly, a group of youthful-looking employees swappping jokes or finishing odd chores. The only noteworthy feature is the small electronic tote board in the middle of the room flashing the going rate in U.S. dollars  --  $175 to $200 a megawatt hour  --  for electricity in the Western United States.

Perched on the 14th floor of a downtown Vancouver office tower, the room is the nerve center of a phenomenally successful energy trading empire, a company that's raked in hundreds of millions of dollars by selling electricity to California and neighboring states in recent months.

The company is Powerex Corp., the wholesale trading arm of British Columbia's government-owned electric utility, BC Hydro. Thanks to Powerex's adroit, well-timed buying and selling of electricity, BC Hydro's profits have nearly tripled in the past nine months to about $862 million in U.S. dollars, from $303 million a year earlier.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

john, saw your CEO on the CNBC this mornng. He  looks and sounds impressive. Stock price does not seem to give a damn. From my  experience the price will show dramatic improvement once the overall tone of the  market gets better and the "California" bankruptcy situation is done  away with.
 
However have you seen the share price of dceg  lately. I think you called it a dog not long ago. We've increased in price by 5X  since the ridiculous lows reached just before Christmas.
 
Give my best to the family.

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

Subject:	CDWR

Today we entered into an agreement with CDWR.  A condition of any new deal was payment for power deliveries already made.  We received $500M earlier this week and $10.9MM today (this $10.9MM was not technically due until March).  Based on those payments, we executed a confirm and EEI with the following terms:

EPMI Sells
CDWR Buys
200MW
Peak
NP-15 
Feb 24-Mar 31
Price: $265 
Payment: Every 7 Days starting Mar 2

CDWR gave EPMI the option (exercisable up to Mar 28, 2001) to extend this deal through March 30, 2006 at a price of $127 (price is retroactive to Feb 23,2001 so if we exercise, we credit CDWR for the difference).   This option enables us to try to work out the credit issues with CDWR.   

This is a very valuable contract if we can get comfortable with the credit so I will continue to work on it.  I will also pursue discussions with them with respect to Pastoria, but I believe we may want to make a decision with Calpine in early March (which might be before we can ink a creditworthy deal with DWR).

Chris

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

What are you up to?  Are you in Houston?  If so, we should touch base @ some point.  Still with Enron?  Do you run the company yet?  Are you responsible for my pricing at the pump?  I have been back in Dallas since '95 and am working with The Carlyle Group...getting married in August...you?
Hope all is well.

Hello Dorie,

I know this is not the most opportune time, but we have a final decision on
the suite pricing.  This special rate was more than 50% off of the original
pricing for just one bedroom.  It was something negotiated between
ourselves and we can't justify a lower rate on a sold out night for Mr.
Lavorato when he continued to stay in the suite.  This might be different
had he moved to a regular room and we could have upsold someone else to the
suite.   However, we had to walk away from that revenue.    I hope Mr.
Lavorato understands our business position.  Please contact me if you have
any questions.

I would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.  I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.  I basically told everyone to drop it when Mike proposed his numbers.  Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.  We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.  For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.  

Let me know if you want to discuss it further.

where do we stand now?  last i heard was an e-mail from oxley (which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore) which said that we don't think that we are going to get there, but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech.  it's been a few weeks now, and i am checking status.  do you still want to offer him the initial contract?  i doubt he'd take it but i need to know.  what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable?  i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution.

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.

John, your accountants are now telling me that no cash is trading hands. That's a pretty sweet deal for EIM - I take a hit for $1.1MM, EIM is granted orig, EIM get the asset, and they don't pay me for it. I assumed that when we said done to $11MM that they would pay me $11MM. pls advise.

Our thought was that it would be useful for Ken Lay and John Lavorato to met with a group of very senior people in the investment community to outline our case for market opening.   A proposed initial list is attached.  It should be expanded to include Ron Munkley  from CIBC World Markets and Bill Homer of Scotia Capital.  The thinking behind this is that these guys are all senior advisors to the Gov't, OPG or Hydro One on decontrol and related issues and several, such as Long, Lindsay and Hudson, are among the Premier's closest advisors.  Let me know what you think so, if we decide to go ahead with this, we can do so soon.   << File: April4Invitees.xls >>

Subject:	Arcor Skilling Approval

Per your request here are the documents you might need regarding Arcor. This was what Dave reviewed last with the exception of the latest currency forwards.

Short Story Version:	Plant close pending Monday February 12th
			Need Skilling's approval because most recent revisions to the dash incorporated a new market view of Argentina devaluation risk 				lowered the Project IRR below RAC Capital Price 18.92% vs 21.88%.
			Additional $800,000 not in the dash from true up structure and major maintenance savings.
			Currency forwards significantly down since the project was reviewed in December due to 40 Billion IMF Argentine package
			Low cost commercial platform to build from $180 per KW
			Liquid market to resell asset due to pending utility privatization in Cordoba

Please let me know if you have any questions I am in town until Thursday afternoon.

I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday.  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details.  Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you on Monday or Tuesday.

Thanks!

 D ear John,

 

I am first  year MBA student at Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western  Ontario. 

 

I  have a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and prior to returning to the  business school Iworked in oil &  gas and telecom industries. I was interested in finding out  oppertunities for summer internships at Enron that will eventually lead towards Enron's  Associate program for full time employment.

 

I  understand that you must have a very busy schedule due to your position. I would  appreciate any kind of advice and  guidanceand will look forward to  hearing from you.

 

Regards

 

Irfan  Ali

I mentioned it to Jeff breifly and I will re-mention it on the plane.  I think it is higher than 67 Million.  Kent Castleman knows the details.

Rebecca and everyone - TGS presentation can be 45 minutes.   On Cuiaba - that can go for 1/2 hour.  Between Transredes, GTB, TBG, and the GAs Unit - can take 45 minutes combined.  If we are adding more time to the agenda - I think a seperate discussion on Petrbras would be useful.  After Jeff hears about wholesale and the assets - it will be clear Petrobras is everywhere.

Subject:	Skilling Visit

Gentlemen,

John and I spoke today on the schedule for Jeff's upcoming visit and decided that it may be light relative to time allocated to the asset reviews.  So, we are proposing that Tuesday, all day, be the asset day.  With Elekro slotted for an hour as originally planned, this extends the time for all of the other assets from the allocated 1.5 hours to a much longer time, including time for the heads of those businesses to have discussions with and answer questions from Jeff.  Also, if Elektro was strapped for time in the original allocation, this change leaves some breathing room for a bit more time there as well.

Pete and Orlando,  I would much appreciate a return memo outlining how you propose to spend the day with these changes.

Thanks much,
Rebecca

We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new endeavors.

The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Execu=

 Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this proces=

Chris;

Do you see what you can come up with when you put your mind to it! Great
idea, but I had this routine planned out whereby I show up last at McConvey'
s, and whilst everyone is busy choosing, I remove my shoes and socks and
very slowly, insert a large cheesie between each of my toes. I then stand
up, lift each pant leg about 4 or 5 inches, and proceed to walk around Rhode
Island's white carpet on my heels only, therefore attempting to keep orange
crumbs off his rug. I would make my picks in this fashion, bringing me good
Kharma.

I'm in if everyone wants to go this way.

Joe.

On April 4, 2001, Peoples Energy will hold their Board of Directors meeting in Houston.  I have been engaged with their executive team in their planning process and the schedule is as follows:

8:00 AM to 10:00 AM	Board of Directors Meeting - Peoples Energy Production Office, Houston 

10:30 AM to 11:30 AM	Enron - Tour of Trading Floor, Enron Bio, etc.

12:00 PM to 5:00 PM	Various Activities (Golf, Art Museum, etc)

6:30 PM -Evening	Enron Field, Astros vs. Milwaukee,  Enron Suite - Enron Hosting

I am requesting introductions (if available) and attendance on the Trading Floor from each of you, Dave, and Jeff Skilling.
