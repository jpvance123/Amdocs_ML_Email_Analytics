I have to pay $25 because I forgot what my score was? 

I'm not asking for an official copy to be sent to a school.
I don't need some fancy transcipt that I can hand to someone.
I was just curious what my scores were.

I paid for the test once and I'm not paying again. 

Great customer service.

Thank you for contacting GMAT.

Official score reports contain the three most recent score results achieved
in the last 5 years.  However, score reports for scores achieved 5 to 20
years ago are still available for reporting.

Although GMAT score records are retained for 20 years, many institutions
will not accept scores which are more than five years old because they
present special interpretation problems.  We suggest that you contact the
institution(s) to which you are applying to determine whether they will
accept older scores.

The fee is US$25 for each score report requested.  Additional score report
requests will be processed for mailing to you and the designated
institutions within one week after being received at ETS-GMAT.  NOTE:
Recipients indicated on an Additional Score Report Request Form cannot be
changed or deleted.

Unfortunately, we do not accept additional score report requests via e-mail
or internet.  To obtain a copy of your GMAT score report or to send copies
of your report to recipients, you will need to request an additional score
report by one of the following methods:

-Complete the Additional Score Report Request Form you receive with your
score report and mail it with the fee to the address on the form.  If you do
not enclose the fee, your request will be returned to you.  Checks and money
orders should be payable to GMAT-ETS.

-You may fax (609)883-4349 or telephone (609)771-7330 your request if paying
by Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.  Please include credit card number
and expiration date.

-Mail a letter requesting additional score reporting to ETS at one of the
following addresses:

REGULAR ADDRESS				COURIER ADDRESS

GMAT						GMAT
Educational Testing Service		Educational Testing Service
PO Box 6104					225 Phillips Boulevard
Princeton, NJ 08541-6104		Ewing, NJ 08628-7435

For faxes and letter, please include your full name, date of birth, current
mailing address, approximate test date, registration number (if available),

Also, what is the status of Colleen?

Subject:	RE: GTV II   

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. 
We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. 
So we may only have 5 weeks left !!! 

We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. 
I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.

Chow,


Geof

No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. 
I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. 

While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type 
for basis options.
