Opps to hedge international exposures locally.



       =DJ Asia Debt:Pricing In Tokyo Credit Derivs Mkt A Bit Askew

Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones



  By Brian Fowler


  A Dow Jones Newswires Column


  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Pricing levels in Tokyo's credit derivatives market
show  it's cheaper to buy protection on some top-rated Japanese issuers
these days  than on U.S. names with similar ratings, a clear sign that
record-high  bankruptcies and bad debts in the banking system aren't
shaking the market's  faith in this nation's top companies.

  Take, for example, Ford Motor Co. (F) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC or 7267).
Both  have solid A2 credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service. And yet,
as of last  week, the cost of credit default protection on five-year Honda
U.S.  dollar-denominated debt stood around 30 basis points, while
protection on  five-year debt issued by Ford Motor Credit, Ford's financing
arm, was around 70  basis points.

  Bankers and institutional investors use the credit derivatives market
either  to shed risk on loans and bonds or to take on risk as an
investment. In a credit  default swap, the most commonly-used credit
derivative, one party pays a fee  measured in basis points on a notional
value. The recipient of the fee - the  risk-taker - is considered the
investor.

  In the case of Honda Motor, Japanese banks looking to reduce the exposure
in  their portfolios to that company's debt would benefit from the
relatively low  cost of doing so. But hedge funds, non-life insurers and
other investors seeking  exposure to Honda as a way of picking up revenue
would get stuck with lower  returns.

  "One of Honda's main markets is the U.S. market, so if an investor wants
exposure to the U.S. auto market, Ford offers better spreads," said Joseph
Slankas, assistant vice president in the Global Credit Derivatives division
at  Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.

  The pricing distortions in Tokyo's credit derivatives market can be
linked to  two main factors: the low interest rate environment here and
skewed  supply-demand dynamics.

  "In the last two years, markets have swung from a focus on hedging to
being  totally dominated by investors," said Malcolm Perry, managing
director at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia Pet. Limited in Tokyo.

  Not surprisingly, heavy demand to sell protection reduces the premium on
that  service.

  More than anything else, however, the narrow spreads in Japan's credit
derivatives market underscore the relatively underdeveloped state of the
nation's corporate bond market and the effect this has on liquidity.
  For decades, Japanese companies have tended to rely heavily on bank
financing  rather than directly tapping capital markets. As a result, while
Japan's  government bond market is as big or bigger than the Treasurys
market, the  corporate bond market here remains relatively small.

  The value of outstanding Japanese corporate bonds was around Y50 trillion
at  the end of February, according to the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.  That's less than one-eighth the size of the U.S. market,
where the value of  outstanding issues stood at $3.372 trillion at the end
of December, according to  the U.S. Bond Market Association.

  A small market means a dearth of liquidity, which inhibits trading in
secondary markets.

  On top of that, the lack of an indigenous Japanese high-yield market -
all of  Japan's high-yield issuers are so-called fallen angels - leaves
investors with  few opportunities to diversify their portfolios. As a
result, the bulk of  trading in Tokyo's credit derivatives market involves
names rated A or higher.
  To be sure, there are also historical factors that tilt the supply-demand
balance. Despite the bad-loan crisis here, many Japanese bankers feel that
domestic top-rated companies are still a relatively safe bet in the
international marketplace.

  "Even if ratings are the same, we tend to feel that the real distance a
corporation has to fall to default is larger here," said Takashi Miyauchi,
manager of the Derivative Products Division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
  It's not hard to see why. The U.S. corporate landscape has been scorched
recently by the likes of companies such as Xerox Corp. (XRX) and Lucent
Technologies (LU), both of which have struggled over the past year with
heavy  debt loads and credit rating downgrades after having been considered
solid  credits going into the year 2000.

  Moody's cut its domestic currency rating for Xerox to Baa2 in September
2000,  three notches below where the rating had been at the end of 1999.
Lucent's fall  was even steeper - to Baa3 in February, four notches below
where it was in  October 2000.

  In contrast, credit derivatives players in Tokyo say they can't recall a
major  credit event on a traded Japanese name since late 1998, when
Long-Term Credit  Bank and Nippon Credit Bank collapsed in quick
succession.
  The sense of relative safety regarding top-rated Japanese names is a key
factor in the dearth of tiering - or spread - between different grades of
double  A credits, according to Kazuyasu Makabe, vice president, credit
trading at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia.

  "Toyota Corp., with tremendous fundamentals, is rated AA1 and trades with
a  credit default swap rate around 15 basis points in yen. Sony, another
great  company, is two notches lower at AA3 and yet only trades about two
basis points  over Toyota," Makabe said.

  In the U.S. you might expect the lower-rated credit to trade at a spread
of 10  basis points or more over the higher-rated company, Makabe said.
  The upshot of this is that low spreads can squeeze some investors out of
the  market for Japanese names.

  "We are focusing on U.S. and euro names because spreads on Japanese names
are  so tight," said Koji Ogawa, assistant manager of the Investment and
Structured  Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance  Co.
  Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine
and  Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in
core  operations while sluggish stock prices and rock-bottom interest rates
have  weighed on investment returns.

  "The core businesses for non-life companies are becoming less profitable,
so  it's important for them to diversify earnings sources," said Ayako
Nakajima,  non-life insurer analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo.

working through economics still and trying to bridge the gaps between 
ourselves and Joe Garcia on 
equity and financing.   last week there was a new twist that is highlighted 
in the word memo.    I think
this make the company more attractive and will get some models to you by mid 
week to put figures
behind the story.

HMPC (China)--plant has been sold. When funds are transferred we should 
receive approximately $78,000 in past due interest. 

DPC (India)--still missing the January fuel management fee due to dispute 
between DPC and MSEB. Expect the April payment soon. Assisting DPC with 
buying domestic gasoil and naphtha from IOC. No formal contract in place due 
to the ongoing problems. Talk of testing the second power block (740 MW) on 
gasoil and then switching to naphtha. Any use of LNG looks to be dead. 
Continue to offer DPC/MSEB risk management services to help stabilize energy 
component of the PPA.  If Enron shuts down the plant then we will have MTM 
issues on the balance of the FMA fees. 

SECLP (Dom. Rep.)--still month to month on distillate and heavy fuel oil 
deliveries. Volume down for the year, but margin per barrel remains wide. 
Still have large outstanding balance regarding fuel payments.

BLM (Panama)--plant having trouble getting paid and in turn has a large 
outstanding balance with us. New GM in place and hopefully he can work 
through some of their ongoing problems.

Empresa (Nicaragua)--back to back with Glencore working well.

PQP LLC (Guatemala)--minor spec and timing issues with Glencore, but overall 
doing fine. 

Working with Mariella Mahan to shift fuel operations on SECLP, Empresa, PQP 
and BLM to her asset group. 

Continue to send out monthly accounts receivable spreadsheet to Enron Corp. 
credit.

Hi Mike,

I just wanted to follow up with you after my meeting with Larry 
Lawyer.  Larry was positive about the product and business
opportunity I developed for the broadband space.  However, 
he also feels that the general business template I presented 
can be readily covered by his current team.  

I am still open to meeting with other members of your team, 
since some of your groups may like to have some people with 
structured finance and origination capabilities work a little 
more closely with them.  I'll follow your suggestion.  Thanks
again for your time.

Mathis.

Mike and Jeff:

1- I have been working with Chris Mahoney to secure some real estate on the 
Global Markets Floor in London. We will have 10 seats behind the crude team.
2- Alex McLeish will manage London and Singapore crude and products 
fundamentals. 
3- Brad Hitch will have responsibility for organizing  the London coal, 
petchems and lpg fundamentals teams.
4- We will be hiring 3 or 4 summer students (cheaper and more flexibility 
than full time.) Alex McLeish and Andrew Hill have identified several 
candidates from some British schools. Several schools in the UK have an 
energy (petroleum ) specialist program. Andrew will be interviewing some 
candidates  this week.
5- I have asked the following people to manage the following commoties and 
teams:

Crude and Products: Richard Lassander (US)
   Alex McLeish (UK and Rest of World)

LNG, Petchems, LPG: Lowell Bezanis

Ags and Freight: Jeff Andrews

Coal:   Jen Fraser

6- Our first pan-EGM commodity report will be published June 8th. It will 
provide a short term fundamental outlook on all of our commodities.

Regards
Jen

Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

Richard Dukes

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the Federal withholding tax regime (this regime was 
not altered by the Law), all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of 
taxes that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 
or 600 "tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  
The attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

John, thanks for the follow up.  I will forward your email to Andy Zipper, 
who is in charge of EOL.  This will be taken care of with the priority it 
deserves.  Jeff

Jeff, John  - this is where we need some help.  At our meeting in New 
York,several of the
presenters expressed dissatisfaction with the Products Control Group.  One of 
the 
issues in my presentation was time spreads.  Since Oct of 2000 we have been 
trying 
to put this out in Sing because it was much more liquid and carried lower 
risk than the 
flat price trading we are doing now on EOL.   PCG kept trying to force feed 
us a 
format based on US Nat Gas.  This setup would not be acceptable to our 
customers. 
In the meantime ICE beat us to the punch and started offering time spreads in 
March.  

We finally got this sorted out and now have a format ( though not the best) 
that is workable 
and able to be put on line.  However, we are dismayed to see their response 
that they
don't want to waste their time putting other products on line until they see 
some liquidity
in the one product they designed.   I may be naive but once they set up the 
one time spread
product it should be relatively easy to add additional products and or other 
types 
of spreads ( ie - quarter to quarter as opposed to month to month).

Any help is appreciated.

Hi Pat, 

The SG Dubai Time Spread has now been approved by all the relevant 
departments and will be uploaded over the weekend. 

With regards to the other products you have requested, creating time spreads 
for the Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, SG380 HSFO, SG Kero, SG Gasoil & SG Naphtha, this 
will involve creating 6 whole new product types. At this point in time, we 
have a restriction as to how many new product types we can create and we are 
currently working on numerous product launches for the other trading groups. 

Before we go ahead creating more SG product types, we do need to see more 
trading activity in order to justify having to create 6 more new product 
types. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. 

Regards 
Caroline

All,

When you are ready, we can show you how the spread functionality will work on 
EnronOnline.  Still trying to ascertain when these products will be up and 
running.  We have a test server that can be used to test these products.  We 
are asking for spreads on the following products: Dubai, Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, 
SG 380 HSFO, SG Kero, SG Gasoil, SG Naphtha.  If there are any other time 
spread products that you guys would like, please let me know.

Thanks,

Pat

Caroline - What do we need to do to get the other product descriptions routed 
through the system?  I know that you have the Dubai description.  Also, we 
have already created the Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, SG380 HSFO, SG Kero, and we have 
the crack spread for the SG Naphtha.  Therefore, is it necessary for us to 
create all the product descriptions and forward them to you.

Mike,

It is my understanding that the office of the chairman will be distributing 
the attached memorandum to all employees on June 7.  Furthermore, it appears 
that the policy committee recommended that business unit heads send e-mails 
to their staffs, echoing and supporting these recommendations.  We would be 
pleased to prepare a draft for your consideration, if you would like to send 
out such an e-mail to the EGM staff.

John

Mike,
? You will probably receive a call from the  top JDRF Legislative Volunteer, 
Leah Mullin. Her husband, Leo Mullin, is CEO of  Delta Airlines and they have 
a diabetic son. They are also very friendly with  the Brennemans.
? Leah would like to enlist the help of  yourself and any Enron 
powers-that-be for support from Dick Cheney for stem cell  funding.
? As you know, from our many mailouts, this is  a hot topic! We are very 
afraid that Pres Bush and VP Cheney might ban stem cell  research, thus 
negating all chances of our cure for diabetes.
? I hope that you can help Leah when she  calls. I have sung your praises to 
her (and just about everyone from Washington  to Timbucktu). Thanks, Mike.

 I spoke to the Outlook migration team and they have added you, Yolanda 
Martinez, and Mike McConnell to the Outlook Migration schedule for the night 
of Monday, June 11th.  I am copying Gary Bode so that he has plenty of notice 
regarding the public folders and other requirements you have discussed.

 Also, I have put a ticket in to have the Outlook team look into your 
addressing problem.  In the meantime, if someone sends a message to your 
internet address (Cathy.Phillips@enron.com), it will still go through, even 
from within Enron.


Thanks!

Rick,

As Mike probably also mentioned we have the attention at the top of NIC.  
Both Frevert and McConnell got a good taste of their commitment during a 5+ 
hour meeting two weeks ago.  I will be in Houston this coming week to speak 
with the different product heads about Project Sato (NIC) and help establish 
some priorities with them.  We should try to establish some time to speak.

Coordination on this becomes critical to show results as quickly as 
possible.  I plan on speaking with Eric and Jonathan next week as well.

FYI, both Clay and I have known Nissho Iwai for many,many years and, in fact,

Subject: Global LNG's Contacts with Japanese Trading Companies, Nissho Iwai 
in Particular

Joe:

Following up on my phone conversation with Morten Erik today and in advance 
of your meetings in Houston next week, I would like to brief you about Enron 
Global LNG's recent contacts with Japanese trading companies.

We have tabled master spot LNG SPAs, in both FOB and ex-ship form, with 
Mitsubishi, Nissho Iwai, Itochu and Mitsui with the objective to discuss, 
negotiate and conclude these contractual arrangements by late fall this year.

Nissho Iwai represents a special case, though.  In addition to our 
discussions on the master spot LNG purchase contracts, we had previously 
talked with NIC about possible access to some of the LNG shipping capacity 
they control.  Also, during my meeting with Nissho Iwai earlier this week, 
they showed keen interest in connecting with Enron Global LNG's team 
developing the U.S. West Coast terminal opportunities.  NIC, with some other 
Japanese partners, has apparently been trying to develop a specific site in 
California (offshore concept) for some time and is now looking for a 
suitable, strong U.S. partner.  There will be an exploratory meeting held on 
this issue in Houston between Kurt Lindahl and NIC representatives (both from 
Tokyo and New York) probably in early June.

Please let me know if you need more information on this subject.

Regards,

Zdenek Gerych

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;


			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 


If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

as per has mentioned to you, there have been a number o factors working 
against us recently in obtaining insurance for the book.

i was expecting to have a positive response by tomorrow, but the person 
responsible had a baby on saturday, so this may be delayed until later in the 
week. (i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so 
its possible, (but i didnt for the second)).

one unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with 
some of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them 
from doing business with us.

another primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to 
enron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was 
somewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get 
them to transact with us.

another unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact 
that forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few 
million in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common 
wisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand 
would decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as 
ever and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher 
margins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.

we also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient 
portfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the 
business too quickly from this position.

of course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out 
differently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to 
hedge out our book in a difficult environment.

first, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain 
reinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, 
which will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in 
final negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final 
portfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have 
seen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with 
$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = 
$30 million).

second, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a "high gamma" risk going 
into june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but 
if it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying 
commodity to gain time for placing the insurance.
this should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on 
significant risk.
  
this may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  
when backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come 
up with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past 
2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized 
hedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the 
idea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently 
calling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma 
hedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, 
you can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic 
hedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the 
black-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the 
underlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on 
the system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next 
outage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail 
risk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other 
benefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory 
used by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire 
new way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like 
B-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of 
our problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in 
power trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory 
to the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively 
manage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less 
than $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.

we can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince & 
vasant to get their thoughts.

Kathie,

Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I 
appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation 
that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This 
should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.

Here are a few other points of emphasis.

EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and 
commodities to enable them to grow quickly 
These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being 
active in them
EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to 
commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are 
enormous in market size
EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset 
positions
EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale 
businesses
EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings
EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 
quarters in existence
Go big or go home philosophy
EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model 
into other commodities this year
GROWTH is the key!!!


Thanks for your help.

Mike

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 << File: Ensisde Whalley Letter. April 01.doc >>

Subject: Coal information

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

Clay and I have completed our review visits in Korea and Japan.  I will be 
available in Houston starting the afternoom of 14 June and continuing through 
about end-June for PRC's and to discuss and finalize the Pacific Basin LNG 
strategy and organization issues that we highlighted when you were in Korea.  
As we discussed in Korea, I believe that if we intend to develop a Pacific 
Basin LNG business, (including the US west coast), we need to define and 
articulate a vision and strategy to the LNG group by the end of June or we 
risk having our Pacific team members drift away to our competitors.

There is a lot happening in the Pacific and our key people are well known and 
well thought of.  There is a genuine feeling within the team at this time 
that Enron's LNG focus is on North America/Atlantic basin and that there is 
little top management support for the commitment of time and resources to 
build a more global business.  

I'd like to set up a meeting with you to discuss this, preferably on 21 or 22 
June (i.e., right after the PRC reviews).  I need some advance warning on a 
date because I want Clay and Wayne to be there and they both have a heavy 
travel schedule to manage.

Thanks,

Rick

the attached summarizes my points for the meeting wednesday.

the main message is that we have the hedging under control, we are doing what 
we said regarding hedging, even though the insurance has not come through 
yet, and our plans are intact, though modified.




let me know your thoughts.  i also have a figure to show how our exposure 
compares under insurance and the current hedge, but it's hard to draw.
(per - i just sent you a fax -- look for it at 6-3247 in the morning).


another update -- the head of berkshire re called this morning from london 
and i spent about a half hour talking to him.  he seems more comfortable with 
our motives and our business plan but will need to spend some time with us 
when he returns before he can recommend a deal to warren.  one issue is that 
warren knows more about electricity than he does (he owns midamerican  in 
iowa and is looking to buy more utilities -- maybe we can sell him PGE), so 
he will have to be better prepared.  i think they want to work with us, but 
timing is still an issue.

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Two senior executives to retire in company split


KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) _ Two senior executives will retire as part of a
management restructuring at Eastman Chemical Co. coinciding with the
division of the chemical and plastics giant into two separate companies by
year's end.


Eastman Chairman and CEO Earnest Deavenport Jr. said Tuesday that Dr. James
L. Chitwood and Garland S. Williamson will follow him into retirement on
Dec. 31.


That is the date Eastman Chemical has set for its tax-free spinoff into two
companies _ a specialty chemicals, coatings and adhesives company called
Eastman Co., and a plastics and acetate fibers commodities company yet to
be named.


Chitwood, 58, is senior vice president for corporate strategy and chief
technology officer. Williamson, 57, is senior vice president for worldwide
operations and chief health, safety and environmental officer.


Chitwood has worked for Eastman for 33 years; Williamson for 34 years.
Deavenport cited Chitwood's contributions to research and development and
Williamson's efforts to reduce costs.


"We very much appreciate the contributions these two executives have made
to Eastman," Deavenport said.


Brian Ferguson, who will head the new Eastman Co., said his management team
will include: Betty DeVinney, 56, senior vice president for human resources
and communications; Theresa Lee, 48, senior vice president and general
counsel; Roger Mowen, 55, senior vice president for e-commerce and
marketing, and James Rogers, 50, chief operating and financial officer.


Allan Rothwell, who be CEO of the new plastics spinoff, said David Cotey,
44, will be vice president and general counsel; Richard Johnson, 52, group
vice president for fibers; Fielding Rolston, 60, senior vice president of
human resources; Thomas Smith, 57, group vice president for plastics, and
Albert Wargo, 47, vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer.


Based in Kingsport, Eastman has about 15,000 employees in 30 countries and
2000 sales of $5.3 billion.


Its stock price closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.17 Tuesday, up
38 cents.

Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

Mike

Based on last weeks meeting and discussion between the team here and you it 
seems like you are moving toward
separating the non-Nordic region and headquartering it in London.  John 
Sherriff and I are comfortable with this and would like to 
move forward with the plan if at all possible effective April 1, 2001.  We 
would split the groups with one Nordic group here in Oslo, reporting back to 
Enron Europe, and one Team for the rest of Europe in London, reporting back 
to you.  I assume that we can arrange all technical and practical things to 
get this done as soon as possible.  Please give me a call to confirm your 
support (or not if we need to discuss further) and let's see how fast and 
smoothly we can get these changes made.

Regards 


Thor

I want to be perfectly clear in understanding this trade, and where/who is 
managing the risks.

Ted, looks like the deal may/will be hedged on Thursday.  They indicate that 
part of the oil may be offset with an existing accrual position (can't 
remember whether this magic was with train 1 or 2).  Two questions:  1) is 
this being signed off on by accounting, and 2) I would like to make sure that 
the offset position is being "put to bed", ie that we are not going to find 
ourselves trading a long-term piece of crude against the UK gas group at some 
point in the future.

Thanks for the help in advance.

Well, we are almost there, Statoil finally agreed our price today.  Also, it 
looks like the oil volumes that we need to hedge will not be as large as 
anticipated due to an existing long accrual position at the Teesside gas 
plant.  We will get the final amount that Transaction Support will let us 
apply to the Teesside position tomorrow morning and probably hedge the rest 
of it.  The anticipation is that we will need to purchase between 30% and 50% 
from you all.  

Attached are the volumes for both scenarios (30% and 50%).  If you can send 
over mid and offer prices for the two volumes, we will get a final number 
from TS and let you know how much we need to hedge in the morning.

Thanks

Matt,

Please find attached a spreadsheet approximating the oil volumes based on the 
current forward USD/GBP FX rate & either a 33% or 50% hedge based on either 
of the two Train 1 scenarios.

FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few 
days.  This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the 
part I have highlighted.

General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to 
have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the 
project becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.

At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the 
Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as "fierce 
competition", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy 
and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships 
that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time 
that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for 
Dabhol) does not help.

As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud 
of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished 
the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, 
SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system 
for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited 
redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the "ex EI" stigma.

Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press 
announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), 
explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., 
U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai 
government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I 
suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events 
unfold).  

In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the 
Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.

The next several days are not going to be fun....

Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.

05/17/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

It's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in
the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8
billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).

At the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of
Zakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from
the offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal
Dutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at
the beginning of next year.
Having been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal
from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the
mandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE
Offsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press
conference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.

Enron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh
Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure
in the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will
then sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total,
which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its
24.5% interest.

Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no
shortage of interested parties.

"The whole industry wants to get involved," a source close to the project
said.

Among the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which
would compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d
Dubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which
like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then
there are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are
interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for
more than 20 years.

"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy," said one analyst in the
region. "There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi."

After the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is
reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the
course of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line
of thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players
may have more to gain and thus more to offer.

The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is
part of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron
seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to
sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to
selling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had
made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that
were never fulfilled.

Ironically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks
certain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial "term sheet"
for the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the
production of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North
field. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to
deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.

Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is
88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co.
Zadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP
and 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme
Petroleum Council decided against the idea.

John and Larry,

Based on the latest information, EGM wants to be able to mark-to-market $20 
million on the GTL contract this quarter. To do so, we need GTL to sign and 
get final approval of a contract that does not have any contingencies or 
conditions precedent to its effectiveness. I will call Kevin Alexander to 
explain what EGM expects to have in place by the end of this month, and if 
necessary, I will go to London to work through the specific language. Based 
on the latest e-mail from Kevin, he thinks that the project must achieve 
financial close by June 30. This is not necessary and is obviously impossible.

In general, I will stick as closely as possible to the terms of the Marketing 
Agreement already signed and remove any project related contingencies. If EGM 
has the exclusive right to market GTL's methanol, then we should be able to 
mark some income. Then the discussions will focus on how much to reserve. If 
necessary, I will bring up a fixed offtake price for up to 300,000 metric 
tons per year, but I do not think it will be necessary. A prepay is 
definitely off the table. John, I believe that your preference is not to take 
any fixed price risk, rather to collect a fee for marketing methanol. This 
will be easier to get approved. Any contract with a fixed price will require 
sign-off from Bjorn.

After getting the proper contract to satisfy this month's needs for income, 
we will have to work hard to make the underlying project in Darwin feasible 
to avoid having to reverse the M-T-M income later. This will, at a minimum, 
require forcing Phillips to agree to a floating gas feedstock price and a 
settlement of the East Timor dispute with Australia for the gas. Note that 
this issue is a wild card and could kill the deal at any time.

Here are the very, rough numbers for what we can mark-to-market assuming a 
3.5% marketing fee, ten year contract starting in 2005, 1million tons per 
year, various average delivered methanol prices per ton, $500k per year of 
admin expenses to market methanol, a 20% credit reserve and no other reserves:
 Price   MTM Earnings

 $130   $18 million
  150     22 million
  170     25 million

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed with getting GTL to sign and get 
approved by its board a MTM contract by the end of this month.

Jim

PRC TIPS

EGM Management:

Below is a list of Tips for the Mid-Year PRC Process.  Each tip refers to 
information that we have received many questions about and would like to 
clear up any confusion.  We will be meeting with each of you individually 
before the final meetings to ensure that we have captured accurate 
information on all your employees for the meetings.  Please contact me if you 
need further information (X36019).

Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Employees:
? All exempt employees who were hired prior to Jan. 1, 2001 will be 
represented in a PRC meeting and will be ranked (those hired after Jan.1, 
2001 will receive feedback only).  Employees who transferred after 4/30/2001 
will be reviewed by their previous Business Unit.
? Non-exempt employees will receive feedback only, they will not be rated in 
a meeting, only those up for promotion will be discussed.  At year end they 
will be ranked in categories 1-3 only.

Preferred Distribution:
? The preferred distribution is as follows:
 Category 1= 5%
 Category 2= 30%
 Category 3= 30%
 Category 4= 20%
 Category 5= 15%

Descriptors vs. Ratings:
? Descriptors (highly effective, effective, etc...) are used on employee 
feedback forms only and reveal how the employee performs in a skill area 
(i.e.. communication, teamwork, etc...)
? The ratings refer to how the employee ranks next to his peers.  There are 5 
categories of performance ratings-
 -  1= relative to peers the employee is generally among the top 5% of his 
peers;
 -  2= relative to peers the employee is generally between 5%-35% of his 
peers;
 -  3= relative to peers the employee is generally between 35%-65% of his 
peers;
 -  4= relative to peers the employee is generally between 65%-85% of his 
peers;
 -  5= relative to peers the employee is generally among the bottom 15% of 
his   peers.

		 Subject: Other Aspects of Cheney Energy Report Recommendations of Interest 
to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

"The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions."

"The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

"The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.

Subject: RE: Lewandowski "Industry"

Jeff-

Can you believe it! What's there not to love. It is the  finest
mural/painting of its kind I have seen available since the great TH Benton
mural cycle purchased by Equitable. Historically and qualitatively,
Lewandowski is at the top of the second tier of industrial/precisionist/
social realist painters after artists like Benton and Charles Sheeler. This
is a "machine age" masterpiece that epitomizes the glorification of the
worker and industry- a message Enron should appreciate.

The Lewandowski is a 103" x 67 oil on canvas executed in 1942. It came off
the wall of a building in Milwaukee where Lewandowski lived and worked
during the 1930s-40s.
The condition is quite good with almost no inpainting and a few horizontal
crinkles in the canvas.

The Greenville County Museum of Art had the Lewandowski on final
approval,but they hesitated today and I just committed to buy it as it sat
at the museum.

The price is $275,000.00 which is higher than any of Lewandowski's other
works, but this is monumental and unlike any other work. I hope youw ill
agree taht the price is reasonable for a painting of such scale, quality,
and historical significance.

Lewandowski's good early industrial watercolors of this era, 18" x 24" +/-,
have sold for $50,000.00+++. The "Circuit Breakers" painting I own that you
have seen at the gallery is priced at $150,000.00 and it is close to being
sold. I think Southwestern Bell has a Lewandowski watercolor and I know I
recently saw an 1939 industrial  Lewandowski painting hanging at the Dallas
Museum of Art.

The Lewandowski will be shipped to me from the Greenville County Museum in
the coming weeks and I hope you and others at Enron can arrange to see it.

Guys, we are bringing through a VP candidate for your review.

Her name is Faye Worthy.  She has a great sales history in the energy 
industry and I think can really help us in the franchise market (ie) 
McDonalds, Safeway, Starbucks, Motel 6, etc.

I would really appreciate you spending a little time with her.   I will 
forward her resume.

Thanks
Dave

has more bearish fundamentals going for it than even  this bit of "bullish"

 Thanks for the message and let me be the first to welcome you to the Dabhol 
team.  Please send a copy of the FMA to Bruce Lundstrom and his team for 
review.   One of us will get back to you to discuss a way forward.  

 That aside, I'm pretty impressed with your "third party beneficiary" 
proposal.  Did you learn that in Hainan?

Subject: EFI/DPC FMA

In light of the impending arbitration proceedings between DPC and MSEB should 
we file a third party beneficiary claim against MSEB regarding the Fuel 
Management Agreement? The FMA is not part of Enron's equity in the plant, but 
is directly related to MSEB's performance under the PPA. EFI is due $2.5 
million per year in monthly installments, fluctuating with the plant's 
availibility and based on DPC being paid by MSEB. Currently $13.8 million of 
MTM value and approximately $21 million of acurral (non PV dollars) is at 
risk on Enron's books. The DPC plant went commercial in May, 1998 so there 
are seventeen (17) years left on the FMA. What if anything should we do to 
protect EFI's interest?

I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

Mike,

Enjoyed seeing you at the Masters and hope we can do it again in 2002.

I've taken the liberty to attach below the name of an individual who has a
distinguished business career and since leaving Pittston as an executive VP
in 1998, has started his on fund as well as developing other business
ventures.  He is very well connected and highly regarded in the Wall Street
financial community.

I don't know where it may lead but I am of the opinion it would be of
benefit for you both to at least have a discussion and explore
opportunities.

I look forward to your next visit to BMR and also hearing the outcome of
your discussion with Gary.

Working with Amitava Dhar,  Vasant Shanbhogue and John Best,  we completed 
the following analysis to determine max loss for our portfolio of 
transactions for the balance of 2001.

A Model simulation yields max loss of less than $60 million for our total 
portfolio in 2001.

 Comments:  We ran several simulations in the model with 10,000 trials 
showing a max loss without hedges of $49,500,000 - $52,000,000. In 
otherwords, the  highest possible loss experienced in all runs was less than 
$52 million.  We also ran one simulation at 30,000 trials and the max loss 
did not vary   significantly from the earlier trials. Our conclusion from the 
results of the model runs is that the 1 in 100,000 trial would produce a max 
loss (P99.999) of less  than $60 million vs the notional P100 payout of $280 
million.

 This does not address the "Venus falling into the Sun" scenario. Since 
running the simulation does not produce a max loss approaching the P100, we 
had  to go outside the model and create a spread sheet that would force a 
scenario that generated the full loss.

B.  Worst case scenario of all units down on day 1 hits maximum payout of 
$280 million over 5 days.

 Comments: In the spread sheet we assumed an unrealistic scenario that all 
units go down on day one for 5 days. Taking the total MWh covered for each  
unit, we then calculated the power price necessary to hit the maximum dollar 
payout for each unit given a 5 day outage. The 5 day price spike for each  
power market ranged from $1,500 in Entergy to $700 in PJM. Under this 
unrealistic scenario we would reach our maximum payout of $280 million in 5 
days.

C. Power option hedges generate offsetting cash value of $ 215 million, 
reducing our net P100 exposure to less than $65 million

 Comments: We then layered our proposed hedging strategy on top of the 
unrealistic spread sheet scenario in 2 above. Assuming the 5 day price spike  
replicated the forward curve in the MidWest during 1999, a spot market at 
$1,500 pulled forward prices up to a range of $250-$300/MWh. The option   
hedges we would put in place would cost $14-15 million and would yield $215mm 
in positive MTM to offset the payout  of $280 million, giving us the net  
Maximun risk of $65 million.

We need to present our calculations to Vince tomorrow morning to get his sign 
off and can then go over the analysis in detail with you and Greg immediately 
afterwards. We are still not recommending we put the full hedge in place to 
cover this unrealistic scenareo, but the analysis shows we can significantly 
cover the tail risk in our book without having insurance in place. Our 
recommendation remains to put a smaller hedge in place while we continue to 
pursue a insurance partner during the month of June.

Speak to you tomorrow.

Attached is a revised prep memo for the referenced phone call.  The project 
team decided to change the focus to a much greater concentration on timing 
issues and a message that Enron may have to shift resources elsewhere if 
Project Jose cannot move quickly.   Please review and return any comments at 
your earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss, 
please contact me at X-52709, emilio at X-52710, or guido at X-52707.

Mike:  We will advise you ASAP next week when all comments are in and the 
memo is ready to be passed on to Lay.

Tom/John:  We think the call should take place some time during the week of 
June 18.  Our thinking is that a good way to approach setting up the call may 
be to go through Venezuelan Ambassador Arcaya.  Would you please assist in 
setting up a meeting for the project team with the Ambassador in the near 
future.

FYI. As part of our business plan to manage the power price risk for the 
contingent call option book we purchased the following options from the desk 
yesterday. It was not the most cost effective way to hedge ($40 for a $200 
call with underlying around $100), but it keeps us on track executing the 
business plan. As the portfolio becomes larger and we move to using swaps as 
well as options to hedge, we'll be better positioned to minimize our hedging 
costs.

We had a good meeting with Berkshire this morning on the reinsurance piece of 
the book. I'll have a syndication report prepared for you with status on 
Friday.

David

We dealt on the following

EPMI LT Options sold to you

 200 DC in July01 & Aug01 Entergy (On peak, financially settled against MW 
Daily) - 20 MW for upfront premium of $ 40 per MWhr
 200 DC in June01  Entergy (On peak, financially settled against MW Daily) - 
20 MW for upfront premium of $ 9 per MWhr

We need to setup a counterparty to put these in our books. If you can kindly 
let us know the name of the entity which is going to be our counterparty (I 
am hoping it is a 100% Enron Wholesale entity) we can put these in our books. 
Regular confirm can follow.  Hai Chen from our group will be calling you to 
book this deal.

Thanks

I have attached a slightly revised version - I apologize for the delay - but

FYI - see message below re: our potential trip to Mexico City on 5/21.  We're 
pushing to get the meetings back to back but you know how politicians can 
be.  Will keep you posted.  If the meetings can NOT be back to back would you 
want to consider taking one of the smaller company jets?  Your call, I can 
work either way.

Randy:

I just spoke with Pedro regarding the Ministry of Finance Meeting in Mexico
City.  He is hopeful (but not certain) that we can schedule a meeting on
the back end of the PMI session.  I suggest you and Mike continue to keep
the entire day open at this point.   If it turns out that the Ministry of
Finance meeting will be later in the day, Pedro can shuttle you and Mike to
our Mexico City office where you may access phones, desks, etc. during the
interim.

You will most likely meet with the Director General of Credit who is
responsible for managing fx, and financial credit with the international
markets.  He's in a very influential position within the Finance Ministry.

Let me know if you need any additional info at this point. Otherwise, we'll
review the Ministry of Finance document and Maya pricing concepts on
Tuesday, 15th, at 9 am here in our office.

Regards, Eric

Thank you for your email and I apologize for my delay in responding.  For 
just over a year now, we have been working with multiple areas within EES to 
develop opportunities on two fronts: 1) transferring EES's weather exposure 
into the weather derivatives market place and 2) developing products for EES 
to offer to its clients and/or that allow EES to bid more aggressively.

We are very excited about the changes that have taken place at EES and are 
hopeful that we can now begin a mutually beneficial working relationship.  As 
you will see from the attached two documents, we are actively engaged with 
Gordon Savage's group and have a number of individuals within the weather 
group who are familiar with EES.  The Harrah's opportunity originated by Ken 
Rubeli appears to have the most immediate potential to provide an EES client 
with a weather hedge. After the changes, Mallik Avs contacted us to start an 
initiative to hedge volume risk with weather derivatives.

On the weather desk, we are currently very interested in getting long Cooling 
Degree Days ("CDDs"), i.e. hot weather in southern California and the desert 
southwest.  Our currently long position there has done extremely well and we 
will be capping out on those positions shortly.  We believe that if EES were 
to directly approach the weather market place for CDD Calls or swaps you 
could obtain positions that we are unable to i.e. we would like EES to sleeve 
for the weather desk.



Again, we are excited about the new management team and structure at EES and 
look forward to an opportunity to work with you and your people.

Hey Mark. I've talked with both Jeff and Mike, and everyone agrees that we 
need to ensure we can bring weather risk management and products into the EES 
distribution channel. I'd like to know how we can leverage your group, its 
knowledge and capability to maximize the opportunities we have to move 
weather products into our sales channels. 

Also, I understand we are currently working weather products into several 
deals. Harrah's Entertainment is one that is a high priority for us. Please 
let me know if I can help facilitate taking these discussions/ideas and 
turning them into executable products.

I'd appreciate your thoughts on the above items at your earliest convenience. 
Thanks!

Just received confirmation from Enron Europe that they accepted the July 1 
transfer for Enron Japan P&L.  The Oslo weather move to EE has also been

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;


			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 


If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or 
Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high 
stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to 
those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member 
of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our 
offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have 
effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have 
the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, 
when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful 
assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our 
efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have 
any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact 
Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

Mike/Jeff,

These types of opportunities will continue to come up.  We could certainly 
handle the 13MW and it would be interesting to pursue.  We have also seen 
another opportunity to merchant finance a power plant for another new 
entrant.  As you can imagine, if we passed these to EPower they are not 
likely to get done.

any thoughts?

= Confidential =

Joe,

This is an updated information about ALSTOM's latest activity.

Referring to Enron Japan-ALSTOM Japan Coorporation Meeting for Vendor Finance 
at Enron Japan, ALSTOM found an opportunity.

Customer:

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (Hyogo Pref. 60 Hz)
Facility:
- Heavy C firing steam generator without electrcity generation
- Electricity consumtpion 2 MW.
- In terms of permits and land, although further investigation is required, 
in general, it seems acceptable so far.

ALSTOM's proposal to Goodyear Tire & Rubber
- Heavy Oil Firing 15 MW Gas Turbine Co-generation system
(Goodyear tire & Rubber has no money to invest).
- 2 MW for factory and 13 MW for market
- 15-18 months for delivery (estimated)
- Plant cost: 13-15 M$ (estimated)

Next Action required
- EJ to let ALSTOM know deal structure

Issues:
(1) If Enron Japan wants to pursue this opportunity, EJ to respond to them in 
a timely manner, since ALSTOM made an effort to find the opportunity that the 
GT may be able to dispatch electricity next year as per EJ's request.
(2) As per Enron Japan's restructuring, if Enron Japan does not want to 
pursue the opportunity, there may be two options:
- To explain the situstion to ALSTOM and to be prepared for positive 
relationship discontinued (potentially possible)
- To transfer this project E-power by saying, for example, physical asset 
related projects are now handled by E-power.

Please advise me of your comments on the above.

Thanks and regards,

I understood that the approx. selling price was $58 mm (which is the Enron 
book value after the write downs).  Would there be a reason that EOTT would 
not include that investment in their calculations to get to their desired 
return?  There may be something about the commodity deal I don't understand.  
I will get a meeting with all of us so we can decide what to do.

Wes, according to your voicemail this morning, you said the 14% return we 
were giving EOTT was due to the way we've written down the plant.  In fact, 
that is not the case.  It is due to our ability to imbed a 14% return due to 
commodity prices and spread values.  It has nothing to do with the plant, as 
I know the deal to be.  

Thanks for the info.

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

As you know, the mid year PRC process is underway.  The system "officially" 
closed for feedback last Friday, 6/1.  The system will remain usable by 
supervisors until the PRC process has completed.  Below is a schedule of 
other dates that you should be aware of:

6/18  EGM Commercial Support PRC Meeting
6/19  EGM Trading PRC Meeting
6/20  EGM Origination PRC Meeting

6/25  Associate and Analyst PRC Meeting

7/10  EWS Final PRC Meeting
(In this meeting, Mgr and above will be cross-calibrated for all of EWS.  
Below Mgr, the curves for each job group will be reviewed at the business 
unit level and then overall for EWS.  At the end of this meeting, there will 
be a pre-PRC for VP's in preparation for the 7/23 meeting.)
 
7/23 & 7/24 Executive Committee PRC
  (In this meeting, VP's and MD's will be rated relative to their peers 
across Enron.)

A few side notes:

? Please make sure your employees have completed a self-evaluation.  The 
"accomplishments" section of this evaluation is viewable in the PRC meeting 
in which the employee is reviewed.  (As of today, the system will still allow 
employees to complete the self-evaluation.)
? 
? As you are preparing to represent employees in a PRC meeting, be aware that 
the consolidated feedback and self-evaluation are printable.
? 
? Lastly, if you will be asking any of your direct reports to attend one of 
the EGM meetings on 6/19-6/20, please let me know asap.  I must provide a 
complete list of meeting participants before we are able to conduct the 
meeting.  (Pls. err on the side of less rather than more people while 
ensuring that employees receive fair representation).

Please call me (ext. 59386) or Khymberly Booth (ext. 36019) should you have 
any additional questions.

Subject: Meeting with NWS at LNG 13 - Followup

Today, I spoke to Greg Veitch (Shell's representative to NWS) about an 
upcoming meeting.  During the call, he asked me about Mike McConnell's 
comment at the LNG 13 meeting that we were concerned about some of NWS' 
consortium partners and how they viewed a potential sale of LNG to Enron.   
He was concerned that Enron was inferring that Shell or BP somehow interfered 
with the process that NWS had instituted in evaluting the bids they received 
for the wedge cargoes.  I told him that I didn't know what exactly Mike meant 
but that it was probably more in the context of Shell and BP being global LNG 
competitors of Enron and not to the specific process around the wedge deal.  
I also told him that I was quite comfortable with the process that NWS used 
in evaluting the wedge cargo proposals and that I didn't see any issues (i.e. 
we assume that Shell put in the best proposal for NWS both on price and 
flexibility and that the final evaluation was made by all partners except 
Shell and BP).  

I've gotten to know Greg quite well over the past year and he told me off the 
record that Shell's bid was quite a bit better in terms of price (he implied 
about 15-20 cents higher) and flexibility (basically no call back premiums).  
This is something I have also been able to confirm indepedently with our 
contacts at Mitsubishi and BHP.   Once we lost MetGas as a potential 
discharge point for the wedge cargoes,  Shell had an advantage over us 
because of access to Cove Point's higher basis differential and access to a 
larger shipping fleet.    This underscores the point that Enron will find it 
difficult to compete on Price and Flexibility on merchant deals in the near 
term.  Our ability to develop proprietary global market outlets supported up 
by a critical mass in shipping will be the key to developing a viable LNG 
business.

A quick heads-up.  Our initial VAR calculations from Bjorn suggest a current 
increase in John's VAR from $8.3MM to $11.5MM in total.  Bjorn is still 
working with Scott Earnest in regard to position limits.  

A few other facts from Rick Causey's meeting yesterday with Mike Patrick and 
Rodney Faldyn.  Rick asked questions regarding (1) how EGM would manage these 
positions, (2) how we would manage the securities law issue of short-swing 
profits (Section 16 in the SEC 1934 Act) regarding the FAS 140 and the 
restructure of the subordinated units in 3Q on which corporate development is 
working, (3) disclosure of the transaction and sensitivities due to the 
affiliated parties and (4) whether or not the FAS 125/140 structure makes the 
most sense versus other EWS earnings.  I may need to ask you guys to call 
Rick on #4 to let him know how important this is for EGM and that Stan and 
Rod are comfortable with the FAS 125/140 deal.  John and I will follow-up 
with Rick on #1.  We are working on structuring around issue #2 and we will 
be working with Koenig's group next week regarding issue #3.  We are 
currently in discussions with AA regarding their recommendation concerning 
disclosure which will be the input for which Rex Rogers and Mark Koenig will 
be looking.  Thanks.

I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.  Actually this is 
somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts.

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Here's a follow-up to our SABIC conversations.

 Doug did a great job on pitching Enron Online and answering all of their 
questions. I pushed them hard over lunch about the next step and how we get 
them to use Enron Online. I couldn't figure out why they were so hesitant 
until Mohammad told me they were (I think I heard him right) equity investors 
in Chem Connect. Quite simply, they know they made a mistake and need some 
time to explain why they would invest in one system but want to use another. 
What I need to do is follow up with a letter touting why they need to use 
Enron Online and why is doesn't conflict with Chem Connect.

There is another way we can continue to solidify our relationship: In late 
June their operations planning group will be in Houston (25-29). The 
Operations Planning and Economics Studies Group is headed by Vice President 
Al-Sadhan and would like to benchmark our operations, planning, budgeting and 
performance reporting. They are looking for a broad overview and I think we 
can put together a visit  that sells Enron as a partner. The more SABIC 
people exposed to us the better chance we have to make in roads. Who should I 
work with on setting up what should be no more than a 2-3 hour visit?

Finally, I should update you on Saudi and the gas initiative. As you know, 
when Oxy/Enron was invited into the Kingdom, SABIC approached me to partner 
in the downstream portion of the project. Since that time, Enron has had to 
notify the Saudi's that Oxy will be the lead, that we will not contribute an 
equity or directly participate in any segment of the project,  we will have 
an advisory role and will not sign the MOU on June 3. It looks like the Saudi 
reaction was to replace us with Marathon which is causing some heartburn with 
Oxy as they sort out partnership shares, Oxy not wanting to drop below their 
30%.  I have talked to Oxy about SABIC and think I can  keep SABIC's  
partnership interest alive. It is just a very delicate situation right now 
and Enron needs to stay quietly on the side lines until the signing on June 
3.

Enclosed are the revised DASHES for the two Allegheny Deals.  These are very 
similar to what has already circulated.   The relevant differences between 
this version and the previous version are 1) Exclusion of June from Coverage 
, 2) Lower system strike price (set at ATM at deal closing close)  3) Total 
package price dropped from 6.75MM to 5.25MM, 4) Lower mean losses and lower 
P99.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

Gentlemen:
I interviewed Adrian back in the fall. I made him an offer to join my group, 
but he elected to go to EES. He is a hard-working bright individual who comes 
well-recommended. I told him at the time, he would be welcome on his next 
rotation. I am still waiting to hear on this.

Mike,
 It was nice talking to you at the EGM info session on Monday, the 7th at the 
Hyatt.  As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, 
specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg 
Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the 
mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to 
your efforts.  
 I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert 
in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the 
controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost 
centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory 
Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole 
source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial 
reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and 
overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also 
represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 
2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.  
 In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, 
forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.  
Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system 
development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis 
Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an 
American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the 
Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.  
My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 
110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a 
dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or 
requests of me, please feel free to let me know.  Thank You
 Adrian Woolcock

Hi Eric,

I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a 
challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to 
see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations 
are met.

 I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is 
very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 
1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about 
the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he 
was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows 
him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of 
working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people 
for your group.

Have a nice trip back home.
Fernando

any sense given attached memo?

Subject: Wyoming

Wyoming Governor Geringer has been a leader on energy issues in the West 
since (at least) the end of 2000 (when California's energy crisis pushed the 
Western Governor's Association to hold an emergency session in Denver).  
Based on discussions with his staff, it appears that the Governor likes our 
company and supports our efforts to open markets.  His public comments, which 
are developed by the Governor's office with little outside influence, match 
both the direction and intent of many of our own policy objectives.

You asked that I summarize my observations from yesterday's meeting of the 
Wyoming Energy Commission.  

I participated in the first session of the Wyoming Energy Commission at the 
Governor's invitation.  (We were invited as the keynote speaker for the 
session).  The Commission was created by the Wyoming legislature to look at 
Wyoming's energy future from the standpoint of both consumers and the 
producers.  The Commission was given a $1 million budget and authority to 
take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state.  

In conversations with the Governor's staff; it appears that they are familiar 
with commodity markets--particularly ag products.  They understand the 
concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best 
when there is adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail 
capacity.  They also understand that their are some contraints on the 
transmission system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints 
moving north, south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major 
pipeline serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and 
some problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  
While they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't 
been able to put it all together in a cohesive way.  They want our help in 
putting together the various pieces of the energy puzzle.  

I can't help but think that there is opportunity for Enron in Wyoming either 
as an advisor (for a fee) or as a business partner--e.g., there has to be 
some room for combining the energy markets--i.e., arbitraging the value of a 
coal-fired kWh and a gas-fired kWh or providing some incremental improvement 
to the market for their sale of commodity out of state.  There also may be 
some opportunity to develop coal-fired or gas-fired plant.

Indeed, Wyoming is a major producer of natural gas (including coal-bed 
methane) and coal.  They want to produce more, but want to avoid the boom and 
bust cycle of a resource dependent state.  (For example, the state moved from 
a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 to an approximately $750 million surplus in 
FY 2000).  They also want to diversify the state's economy and bring economic 
development.  For example, a major focus of the state's Business Council has 
been to recruit "server farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  
They talked about co-locating server farms and generation along the southern 
tier of the state (which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth 
available).  While it is unclear, the bandwidth they are mentioning may be 
EBS fiber.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  It's rare when you get a Governor that 
has some understanding of commodity businesses and wants to provide 
leadership on energy issues.

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

BHP has advised that they will not pursue the Vulan (Project Fireball) 
opportunity.  They intend to concentrate on completing their merger with 
Billiton, and settling issues in Indonesia and China.

We will continue to look at Vulcan independently - and evaluate the need (if 
any) for a partner down the road.

Note to coal guys - Dave Murray (ex Billiton) will run the thermal group and 
Bob Kirkby (ex BHP) will run the coking coal group for BHP Billiton - both to 
be located in Melbourne.  Mike Oppenheimer will be doing something outside of 
the coal group.

Dear Ms Bibi

Eyeforenergy Asia 2001 takes place at the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore,
15-17 October.  It is the follow-up to last year's e-Business for Energy
Asia Pacific, which also took place in Singapore, and will be the
meeting-place this year for the senior energy executives in the region to
discuss all the latest developments in the industry - e-business, regulatory
change, and the subsequent financial impact on both the new and old
economies.

I would like to invite you to give a presentation at the conference.  I have
attached the full program.

We expect 150 very senior delegates from across the energy industry, from
Asia and beyond - oil and gas co's, but also electricity utilities, as well
as exchanges, analysts and investors.  Speakers will come from companies
such as Caltex, BP, Shell, Petronas, Premier and Texaco, and hopefully
Enron.

If you have any questions at all, or would like to discuss your presentation
in more detail, please do not hesitate to give me a call or drop me an
email.

Best regards

Joe Barry

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

Mike and Jeff,

This note is to update you on information we have related to the GTL Methanol 
project in Darwin, Australia.

Larry, John and I met with Chase/JP Morgan, specifically, the banker who led 
the financing of the Titan Methanol Plant in Trinidad. We wanted to get an 
independent opinion on the financeability of the current GTL structure and 
insights into the current market for project bank debt for commodity deals.

The key opinion of Steve Nordaker, the Chase banker on the Titan deal, was 
that project banks do not take commodity price risk unless they have a very 
clear, supportable view of the long-term market price for that commodity. As 
for methanol, with the high level of uncertainty about the demand and price 
for methanol as tied to the future of MTBE, Steve said that Chase would need 
a profit margin contractually guaranteed by the project documents before 
lending to a project. Steve further suggested that if the gas supply contract 
had a floating price tied to methanol prices with a floor price, that floor 
should be around $0.50/ mmbtu to give the lenders comfort that the plant 
would remain competitive over the years required to repay the debt. GTL has 
agreed to a fixed price of $1.02/mmbtu with Phillips. Chase would not lend to 
the Darwin Methanol project as structured with a fixed price for the gas 
input and an index price for the methanol off take. Nordaker thought that it 
would be very hard to find even one bank to take the unhedged risk on the 
methanol margin. In fact, GTL will need at least ten banks to raise the full 
$250 million of senior project debt.

Another key risk that Chase would not take is the strength of the Sponsor, in 
this case GTL. GTL has a total market cap of approx. $30 million. It will 
have to issue new shares equal in value to more than its current market cap 
to fund its portion of the project equity. If the project experiences cost 
overruns, the Lenders will expect someone with a high credit rating or 
demonstrable financial strength to invest whatever amount is needed to finish 
construction. 

I think that GTL is taking a big risk of wasting several months before 
finding out that its project is not financeable. In addition to the waste of 
time, GTL will have signed a gas supply agreement that will have to be 
renegotiated, and other key documents may need to be amended. EGM will not 
get the methanol it wants on time and may be faced with the choice of 1) 
taking on extra methanol price risk (by agreeing to buy more of the plant's 
output at a fixed price or by providing sponsor support) or 2) dropping out 
of the deal. If we have hedged some risk in anticipation of the project 
succeeding, then we will face pressure to take on more risk to cover the 
hedges.

I think that GTL's deal is fixable, and John wants the methanol. I, 
therefore, recommend that we push GTL on several key structural elements so 
that GTL achieves a feasible project and so that EGM receives its methanol on 
time. Because EGM is only willing to buy 1/3 of the plant's production of 
methanol at a fixed price, the most important point is to get Phillips to 
agree to a floating gas price. Kevin Alexander of GTL says that they have 
tried, but that Phillips would not accept it. If necessary, we should offer 
to intervene with Phillips. We will, also, try to keep GTL realistic on the 
time it takes to negotiate project documents (six to nine months) and to 
issue public equity (no limit if the markets turn bad).

John, Larry and I are developing a plan to move GTL to a realistic structure. 
We may need your help with Phillips. We will keep you apprised. 

Jim

ditto. Even before we had signed the contract, you all took over the 
integration and gave me every confidence that you would get the job done.  
Thanks for all your continued help.  We are going to need all of your input 
as we begin to develop deal entry, scheduling and dispatch systems.

I wanted to take a minute to commend all of you on a job well done in 
successfully integrating WebModal and implementing the operational processes 
for Freight Markets in a very short period of time.  I have been involved in 
several acquisitions over the years here at Enron and I have never seen one 
that went as well as WebModal from an operational standpoint.  Everyone came 
together as a team and ensured that integration timelines were met and that 
the business was allowed to continue its daily operations with minimal 
problems internally or to our external counterparties.

Again, congratulations on a great job.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

Brent

I'm pulling together some sample presentations that should help.  In 
addition, I ususally get fairly involved the first time someone presents so 
just let me know if I can help.  I had assumed that Shankman would attend and 
you are welcome to bring additional people to the Board meeting if you think 
they can contribute to the presentation in some way.  I just ask that you not 
have a cast of thousands!

Rebecca,

I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.  He 
has never attended one.

It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially 
like this.  Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of 
presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of 
information.

Thanks,
mike

The project name was changed at the request of Corporate Development as they 
are concerned about discovery and a project name which could imply Enron 
stuffed EOTT.  The following is a current overview we are using to update the 
different disciplines involved with the transaction to date.  Our 
calculations continue to show a net $100MM benefit to EGM with 2Q $62MM due 
to Enron's current 38% economic ownership of EOTT.  No new updates to 
fastrack a sale of the GP.

In light of the impending arbitration proceedings between DPC and MSEB should 
we file a third party beneficiary claim against MSEB regarding the Fuel 
Management Agreement? The FMA is not part of Enron's equity in the plant, but 
is directly related to MSEB's performance under the PPA. EFI is due $2.5 
million per year in monthly installments, fluctuating with the plant's 
availibility and based on DPC being paid by MSEB. Currently $13.8 million of 
MTM value and approximately $21 million of acurral (non PV dollars) is at 
risk on Enron's books. The DPC plant went commercial in May, 1998 so there 
are seventeen (17) years left on the FMA. What if anything should we do to 
protect EFI's interest?

EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 
active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide 
information to us in a timely and accurate fashion. (I wish I could get the 
rest of the company to this point). I'm told that the people referenced below 
have contributed in a big way to this effort. Thanks for the effort. Rick

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( 
including Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts 
in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over 
Global Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( 
Houston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as 
for us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of 
business next day.

Hello Mike,

My name is Brian Dawson and I work in ENA Merchant Finance.   I heard you 
speak at the Adams Mark Hotel last week discussing the future of EGM.  I 
wanted to let you know that I may have some information that might be useful 
to you.  I have a close friend who is the Vice President Marketing/Purchasing 
of Rigid Building Systems located off of Aldine Westfield and Beltway 8.  He 
has over 20 years in the industry of buying from the mills and selling steel 
components to contractors, end users, and service centers.  We were 
discussing the steel industry as a whole and some of his ideals were 
identical to yours.  I didn't know if you would be the right person for this 
information.  If you would like for me to forward this information to someone 
else, please let me know.  Thank you for your consideration.

Brian Dawson

Just a reminder of what we discussed regarding the fate of the Singapore 
office. The trader I mentioned was Pat Markey and he moved there about a year 
ago. He has done a great job on EOL and should be able to give you a good 
overview of the Singapore office both pro and con and how it could be 
improved.

Mike / Brent / Beth,  

This summarizes the near term delivery milestones for the Position Manager 
functionality within Thunderball.  

The first release of  Position Manager    ( Phase I )  within the Thunderball 
Moneypenny application is as follows for Liquids, Crude, Products and Coal  :

? Houston  UAT  (User Acceptance Test)  -- Week of May 7 through week of May 
14 . User acceptance test started today and is going well. 
 
? London UAT    (User Acceptance Test)    -- Week of May 14 through May 21

? Singapore UAT  (User Acceptance Test)      -- Week of May 21

Phase I full release will be complete by May 31 (all trader desktops)
The target is to deliver the following Phase 1 and Phase 2 functionality 
through the May / June time frame in a series of iterative releases.  

Phase I includes (Liquids, Crude, Products, Coal) : 

? Option Specific Views
? Spread Option Position (although not real-time updates)

Phase II Includes:

? User configured total columns/rows
? Counterparty filter
? Notional/Exposure calc toggle
? More meaningful labels for curves
? Geographical grouping of curve codes
? Predictive roll off
*with option to incorporate into current position
? Volumetric trading limits
? Roll risk

As an FYI -- We are in the process of developing a management level view of 
all EGM delivery expectations and plans for the next 12 months. This will be 
ready by the end of this month. We will also be developing a weekly report 
that will summarize status against planned milestones for Thunderball.  
Eventually this will be published for the other key projects that we will be 
starting for EGM.    

Let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Guys:

See below resignation letter of Ivan van Niekerk - this is a huge loss for 
our group, as Ivan was uniquely qualified to originate the South African 
opportunities that we are pursuing.  I spoke with him for about an hour today 
asking him to reconsider as I believe that we are capable of addressing all 
of his complaints.  Unfortunately, Ivan indicates that he has already made up 
his mind and that he does not want to go back on his word to his prospective 
employer.  He will give it some thought overnight and I will speak with him 
again tomorrow (Fri).  This is an example of the toll that excessive 
administrative burdens are starting to take on commercial employees - 
particularly acute in remote offices.

Jeff,

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is "clean coal" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

Mike
Would be good to see you.  We will be in the middle of our winter (~60-65 
degrees MaxT) in July.  Sydney has a relatively mild winter and there is 
still  all the regular sight seeing.  I will be here all month.  Timing would 
be good from a business perspective as we look to develop and assist with 
more EGM opportunities (e.g. grains).  Let me know firm timing and we can set 
an agenda.  btw Frevert was here last week and we had a great day on the 
harbour.

Mike-

Attached please find a first draft for your Executive Letter for the 
newsletter. I'm sorry that it is so sketchy. EGM is doing so much and I'm not 
sure what you want to focus on right now!  I am afraid if I keep going, I 
will be way over the word count for our space allotment. Right now, there are 
404 words. Please fill in where it is pertinent and monitor word count to 550.

Again, I'm sorry to impose on you with this.

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

George, I'd like to set up a meeting this week (and will have Jennifer set it 
up) about this and the way forward for us.   What is our strategy, etc, with 
respect to this project.  

Jeff

BHP has advised that they will not pursue the Vulan (Project Fireball) 
opportunity.  They intend to concentrate on completing their merger with 
Billiton, and settling issues in Indonesia and China.

We will continue to look at Vulcan independently - and evaluate the need (if 
any) for a partner down the road.

Note to coal guys - Dave Murray (ex Billiton) will run the thermal group and 
Bob Kirkby (ex BHP) will run the coking coal group for BHP Billiton - both to 
be located in Melbourne.  Mike Oppenheimer will be doing something outside of 
the coal group.

Mike:

 Hope you had a safe trip home.  During the reception when you and Mark were 
here, I talked about the need for an additonal senior Enron guy with project 
development experience and said I was talking with two internal candidates at 
the time.   Both have fizzled out.  I seem to recall you mentioned Rick might 
be available/interested if we could get over his possible title and reporting 
concerns (Senior VP and Management Committee Member at E-Power reporting to 
our Japanese president, Mr. Seguchi).  If you think this is an option, I 
would appreciate if you would mention the role to him and ask him to give me 
a call or send me an e-mail and I will follow-up.

Thanks, Carey

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

Mike,

Just wanted to close the loop with you on this topic.  Attached is a brief 
conclusion and recommendation memo that I prepared for Eric Gonzales that 
sets out the issues I have previously briefly discussed with you.  I have 
discussed this with Frevert who is fine with it and at his request I have 
verbally advised Duke LNG of our position.  There is also a meeting scheduled 
with them on June 7 that I will be attending with Mark, so I don't think the 
letter referenced in the memo will be necessary at this point.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call me at X-52709.

Neal

Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out at 
our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your 
efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out 
to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The 
information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended 
up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams 
not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives 
underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the 
individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds 
and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community 
Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an 
effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the 
details.

I agree that George is well suited to origination, but he has also spent 
quite a bit of time looking at investment opportunities for Koch in a wide 
variety of industries that they are active in. If EGM is looking at several 
acquisitions, I could see him being the point person for EGM on transactions 
and thus able to relieve some of the burden on the folks focusing on trading. 
However, I know that George is happy at Koch, so it would have to take a very 
exciting opportunity for him to leave, i.e., something where he would feel 
the job was "tailor made" for his skill set. Maybe we don't have something 
like that for him right now.

I have known George since his Bp days. very bright guy would be most useful

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil
